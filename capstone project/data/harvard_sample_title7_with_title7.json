ROBERTS, District Judge.\\nPro se plaintiff Linda Cruz-Packer filed a complaint alleging that her federal employer, the Transportation Security Administration (\"TSA\"), terminated her employment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and defamed her. TSA has moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Because Cruz-Packer has not demonstrated that this court has jurisdiction over her claims, the motion to dismiss will be granted.[1]\\n\\n\\n*69 BACKGROUND\\n\\nTSA hired Cruz-Packer in June 2002 as a Transportation Security Specialist.[2] (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 14.) Shortly after she was hired, Cruz-Packer was assigned to a criminal investigator position. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 17.) TSA alleges that her position required her to have a Top Secret security clearance enabling her to have access to national security information, something Cruz-Packer says she had not been told. (See Def.\\'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def.\\'s Mem.\") at 1-2; id., Ex. 1 at \u00b6 2; Pl.\\'s Mem. of Points and Authorities Denying Def.\\'s Mot. to Dismiss (\"Pl.\\'s Mem.\") at 8-9.) In March 2003, Cruz-Packer completed at TSA\\'s request an \"SF-86\" security questionnaire which started her background investigation. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18.) The background investigation revealed that a prior employer had terminated Cruz-Packer for misconduct, a fact she had failed to disclose on her SF-86 form. (Def.\\'s Mem., Ex. 1 at \u00b6 2.) TSA claims that her lack of candor prevented her from receiving the required security clearance. (Id.) TSA initially suspended Cruz-Packer and then fired her for unsuitability on November 18, 2004. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.)\\nCruz-Packer alleges in her amended complaint that her termination constituted discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual harassment, and retaliation (Counts I-III), and that TSA defamed her by posting at the front entranceway of the building in which she worked a notice stating that she was not allowed to enter the building (Count IV).[3] (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 28-38; Pl.\\'s Mem. at 1-2.) TSA maintains in a declaration signed by a TSA official that the reason Cruz-Packer was terminated was that she could not obtain a security clearance. (Def.\\'s Mem., Ex. 1 at \u00b6 2.) It has moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the decision to deny security clearances is not subject to judicial review. (Def.\\'s Mem. at 1-2.) Cruz-Packer opposes the motion, arguing that the defendant\\'s stated grounds for her termination are a pretext because the defendant did not indicate to her in writing that maintaining a security clearance was a necessary condition of Cruz-Packer\\'s employment, and because other criminal investigators with negative events in their backgrounds were not dismissed or denied security clearances. (Pl.\\'s Mem. at 3-8.)\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\"On a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiff bears the burden *70 of establishing that the court has subject-matter jurisdiction.\" Shuler v. United States, 448 F.Supp.2d 13, 17 (D.D.C.2006) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)). While factual allegations contained in the complaint must be accepted as true when reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence &amp; Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 164, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993), a court may consider material outside of the pleadings when determining whether a plaintiff has established jurisdiction to hear the case. See Venetian Casino Resort v. EEOC, 409 F.3d 359, 366 (D.C.Cir.2005) (citing EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624-25 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.1997)).\\n\"Title VII prohibits the federal government from discriminating in employment on grounds of race or sex, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16, and from retaliating against employees for engaging in activity protected by Title VII.\" Montgomery v. Chao, 546 F.3d 703, 706 (D.C.Cir.2008). Proof in a circumstantial Title VII case such as this one often unfolds following familiar steps. Where a plaintiff presents prima facie evidence of discrimination or retaliation and the defendant responds with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, the sole remaining issue is whether the adverse employment decision was made for a discriminatory or retaliatory reason. Id. at 706 (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), and Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 493-94 (D.C.Cir.2008)).\\nTSA argues that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Cruz-Packer\\'s Title VII claims because the litigation would necessarily question the reason for the decision to deny the security clearance, which is prohibited by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(g). Section 2000e-2(g) provides, in relevant part, that it is not unlawful to terminate an employee if\\nthe occupancy of such position ... is subject to any requirement imposed in the interest of the national security of the United States under any security program in effect pursuant to or administered under any statute of the United States or any Executive order of the President ... [and] such individual has not fulfilled or has ceased to fulfill that requirement.\\nCourts have found jurisdiction lacking in cases implicating security clearance determinations. The Supreme Court held that the Merit Systems Protection Board, the administrative body empowered to adjudicate challenges to federal personnel actions, could not \"review the substance of an underlying decision [by an agency] to deny or revoke a security clearance in the course of reviewing an adverse [employment] action.\" Dept. of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 520, 108 S.Ct. 818, 98 L.Ed.2d 918 (1988). The D.C. Circuit later found that Egan\\'s reasoning also applied \"in a Title VII action to preclude a `nonexpert body\\'\\x97whether administrative or judicial\\x97from resolving a discrimination claim based on an adverse employment action resulting from an agency security clearance decision.\" Ryan v. Reno, 168 F.3d 520, 523 (D.C.Cir.1999). The court stated that proof in that Title VII case could not follow the usual steps\\nwithout running smack up against Egan. The nondiscriminatory reason proffered below for withdrawing the employment offers was that the applicants\\' long residence abroad prevented DOJ from conducting an adequate security clearance background investigation. The appellants could not challenge the proffered *71 reason\\'s authenticity without also challenging its validity.\\nId. at 524. Therefore, \"because the district court ... could not proceed with the appellants\\' discrimination action without reviewing the merits of DOJ\\'s decision not to grant a clearance, the court was foreclosed from proceeding at all.\" Id.\\nMore recently, in a case that is factually similar to this case, the court of appeals upheld the district court\\'s decision dismissing a complaint for lack of jurisdiction based upon \u00a7 2000e-2(g). In Bennett v. Chertoff, 425 F.3d 999 (D.C.Cir.2005), the plaintiff was employed as a criminal investigator with the TSA. During its investigation into Bennett\\'s background, the TSA determined that she lied on her Declaration for Federal Employment. The TSA informed Bennett that her employment was being terminated \"based on her unsuitability for the position,\" and in its official notification, the TSA stated that it was terminating Bennett because of a \"negative suitability determination.\" Id. at 1000-01. Bennett filed a complaint alleging that TSA\\'s stated reason for terminating her was a pretext and that the real reasons were discrimination and retaliation against her for filing an administrative complaint. As happened with Cruz-Packer, TSA provided a sworn statement from a TSA official stating that the plaintiff\\'s termination was \"due to her inability to sustain a security clearance.\" Id. at 1001, 1003 (internal quotation and citation omitted).\\nCruz-Packer argues, as did Bennett, that the district court has jurisdiction to hear these claims because the TSA termination was for a \"negative suitability determination,\" not for a denied security clearance. (Pl.\\'s Mem. at 29, 32-34.) However, Bennett determined that \"lack of `suitability\\' in ordinary language can encompass lack of suitability because of ineligibility for a security clearance[.]\" Id. at 1002. That meant that the letter that Bennett received informing her that she was terminated for a negative suitability determination was \"not inconsistent with termination on the basis that Bennett could not sustain a security clearance.\" Id. at 1002-03. Cruz-Packer also argues, as did Bennett, that the TSA\\'s security clearance explanation was pretextual, but Bennett determined that courts could not \"adjudicate the credibility of that claim\" because such an adjudication would \"require the trier of fact to evaluate the validity of the agency\\'s security determination.\" Id. at 1004. While Cruz-Packer argues the merits of the decision not to grant her a security clearance and claims that the decision was a pretext, she acknowledges that the judicial branch lacks the power to review decisions by the executive branch about whether to grant security clearances.[4] (See Pl.\\'s Mem. at 33-34.) Cruz-Packer has not established subject matter jurisdiction over her claims of discrimination.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nBecause this court lacks jurisdiction over claims implicating the merits of a decision to deny a security clearance, and over defamation claims against the federal government, TSA\\'s motion to dismiss will be granted. A final Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Cruz-Packer has also moved under Local Civil Rule 83.11(b)(3) for appointment of counsel to assist her with this civil claim. A plaintiff in a civil case typically does not have a right to counsel. See Willis v. FBI, 274 F.3d 531, 532 (D.C.Cir.2001). \"Appointment of counsel calls for exceptional circumstances and `is wholly unwarranted when [the movant] has not demonstrated any likelihood of success on the merits.\\'\" Kidd v. Howard Univ. School of Law, Civil Action No. 06-1853(RBW), 2007 WL 1821159, at *2 (D.D.C. June 25, 2007) (quoting Nichols v. Mosbacher, 959 F.2d 1101 (D.C.Cir.1992)). Because Cruz-Packer has not shown that the nature or complexity of her case, the potential merit of her claim, or the interests of justice warrant appointment of counsel, her motion for appointment of counsel will be denied.\\n[2]  TSA is now a component of the Department of Homeland Security. At the time Cruz-Packer was terminated, TSA was a component of the Department of Transportation. (See Def.\\'s Mem. in Support of Mot. to Dismiss at 1.)\\n[3]  Defamation claims are specifically exempted under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h), from the torts for which the government may be sued. The federal government has not waived sovereign immunity from defamation claims, and Cruz-Packer cannot proceed against the TSA on Count IV. See Council on Am. Islamic Rels. v. Ballenger, 444 F.3d 659, 666 (D.C.Cir.2006); Banks v. Lappin, 539 F.Supp.2d 228, 240-41 (D.D.C. 2008).\\n[4]  Bennett notes that Executive Order 12,968, \u00a7 5.2(a), 60 Fed.Reg. at 40,252, provides procedural protections, including the right of appeal within the agency, to individuals who are denied security clearances. 425 F.3d at 1002, 1004.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 1575504}]"},{"id":2399053,"date_filed":"2003-12-18","judges":"Terry and Ruiz, Associate Judges, and Nebeker, Senior Judge","case_name_full":"Brenda Elaine MAKINS, Appellant, v.

In November 1998, Brenda Makins brought an action against the District of Columbia claiming sex discrimination and retaliatory firing, in violation of Title VII (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq.). Makins had been employed in the District\\'s Department of Corrections from 1995 until her discharge in 1997. Her complaint sought reinstatement, compensatory damages, and attorney\\'s fees.\\nMakins\\' attorney, John Harrison, began representing her in 1996, after she received notice of termination from the Department. Harrison and Makins did not have a written retainer agreement. In the summer of 2000, at a pre-trial conference, the district judge referred Makins\\' case to a magistrate judge \"for settlement purposes only\" and ordered the District to \"have present at all settlement meetings... an individual with full settlement authority.\" A similar admonition was absent as to Ms. Makins. The judge set the case for trial in December 2000. A few days later, the magistrate ordered the \"lead attorney(s) for the parties\" to appear before him for a settlement conference; the *302 order required that the \"parties shall either attend the settlement conference or be available by telephone for the duration of the settlement conference.\"\\nThe conference took place on September 12, 2000. Makins was not present. After two and half hours of negotiations, Harrison and the attorneys for the District reached an agreement. Makins would receive $99,000 and have her personnel records amended from \"discharged\" to \"resigned\" (to preserve her retirement benefits if she were able to attain other creditable employment). In return, Makins would dismiss her claims against the District. The attorneys \"shook hands\" on the deal and later reduced it to writing. A few days later, when Harrison presented Makins with a copy for her signature, she refused to sign it. The District then filed a Motion to Enforce Settlement. Makins retained another attorney, and the court held an evidentiary hearing in which Harrison, Makins, and the lead attorney for the District testified.\\nThe testimony of Makins and Harrison was at odds. According to Makins, she never agreed to settle her case under the terms Harrison and the District negotiated because \"getting [her] job back had to be part of any agreement.\" She admitted to wanting to settle the case and knowing that the correctional facility in which she had worked was closing. She claimed that Harrison waited until the night before the conference to alert her to it and specifically told her not to attend. She talked to Harrison several times during the settlement negotiations on September 12. But she insisted that she never agreed to the negotiated terms because, as she expressed to Harrison in one of their cell phone conversations that day, getting her job back was a condition to settling the case. Although Makins swore in an affidavit, filed before the hearing, that Harrison alerted her during the negotiations that he was discussing the $99,000 figure, she testified that she did not recall such a conversation.\\nHarrison disputed much of Makins\\' testimony. He said they had extensively discussed the possibility of settlement the day before the conference and that he thought it made sense strategically for his client to remain at home so that \"the Judge couldn\\'t put pressure on her to settle.\" Harrison also testified that he discouraged Makins from insisting on getting her job back. According to Harrison, Makins gave him a number where he could reach her on September 12, and told him to do \"what you think is right, I trust you.\"\\nAt the conference, each side presented its case separately to the magistrate. The attorneys and the magistrate then sat at a table and negotiations began. On several occasions, the magistrate sent one of the attorneys out of the room and talked to the other about what he saw as strengths and weaknesses in the case. By cell phone, Harrison called Makins when he was out of the room. He contends that she agreed to settle for $99,000. Harrison testified that when the District agreed to this figure, he called Makins immediately and \"told her the 99 was done,\" to which she replied \"good.\" Harrison also stated that Makins did not express any dissatisfaction with the settlement until several days later when she refused to sign the papers in Harrison\\'s office.\\nThe District\\'s attorney generally confirmed Harrison\\'s account of the conference (although he did not know what Harrison and his client had discussed by cell phone, or even if they had discussion). In response to the District\\'s offer of approximately $80,000, Harrison said his client was still at $120,000, or thereabouts. The District\\'s attorney replied that he would *303 not settle the case for more than $100,000. Harrison left the room, cell phone in hand, and came back a few minutes later. He said $99,000 would be fine but his client wanted her records changed to show that she had resigned. The District reluctantly agreed. Neither the attorney for the District nor the magistrate spoke to Makins to confirm her assent to the terms of the agreement.\\nThe District Court, observing the \"sharp conflict\" in testimony between Makins and Harrison, declined to resolve it. Instead, the court assumed arguendo that Harrison did not have actual authority to settle the case. The court granted the District\\'s motion to enforce the settlement on the alternative ground that Harrison had apparent authority to bind Makins to the agreement. The court saw \"no justification for the District of Columbia not to reasonably believe that Mr. Harrison had the full confidence and authority of his client.\"\\n\\nII.\\nThere is some confusion as to both the degree of authority required of an attorney in settlement negotiations.[2] Indeed, a review of relevant case law and principles enunciated by the American Bar Association and the American Law Institute demonstrate widespread dissonance not only over the degree of authority, but also the appropriate definitions of authority. We hold that, while attorneys must have some inherent procedural and tactical authority on behalf of clients, for in-court settlement proceedings that attorneys for the parties are ordered to attend, the client must give actual authority to settle the case in the client\\'s absence.[3]\\nWe deem the situation at hand sufficiently analogous to our decision in Bronson v. Borst[4] and distinguishable from our holdings in other cases as discussed below. Actual authority, which may also be referred to as delegated or specific authority, focuses on the client\/lawyer relationship. In Bronson, an attorney sued his former client for declaratory judgment to enforce a settlement agreement that the attorney had accepted and entered into on his client\\'s behalf. We held that \"absent specific authority, an attorney cannot accept a settlement offer on behalf of a client.\" Bronson, supra note 4, 404 A.2d at 963.[5] We reached that holding through an analysis of \"actions which counsel was neither duty bound nor authorized to perform.\" Id. at 962. To be sure, Bronson differs from the case at hand on this point since Bronson did not involve a settlement conference and Harrison was duty bound, by order of the magistrate judge, to attend the settlement conference and participate in negotiations on Makins\\' behalf. Moreover, this is an action by the other party to the settlement rather than the attorney or the client. *304 Nonetheless, Bronson addresses the principle that a client\\'s approval is required \"regardless of the merits of the ... case or the attractiveness of the settlement offer.\" Id. at 962. Contrary to the District\\'s argument before this court, the Bronson holding is consonant with the decision in Ashley v. Atlas Mfg. Co., 7 F.R.D. 77 (D.D.C.1946), aff\\'d, 82 U.S.App. D.C. 399, 166 F.2d 209 (1947). In Ashley, the court found specific authority arising from an in-court proceeding based in part on the fact that, unlike here, the client\\'s attorney announced the settlement agreement in the client\\'s presence. The Ashley court recognized the general rule that an attorney shall not enter settlement without actual authority.[6]Id.\\nWe distinguish our holding here from the line of cases finding apparent authority based on contract theory.[7] The RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY \u00a7 8 (1958) defines apparent authority as \"the power to affect the legal relations of another person by transactions with third persons, professedly as an agent for the other, arising from and in accordance with the other\\'s manifestations to such third persons.\" Thus, unlike actual authority, apparent authority does not depend upon any manifestation from the principal to her agent, but rather from the principal to the third party. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY \u00a7 27, cmt. a. This court has stated that apparent authority arises when a principal placed an agent \"in a position which causes a third person to reasonably believe the principal had consented to the exercise of authority the agent purports to hold. This falls short of an overt, affirmative representation by a principal ....\" Feltman v. Sarbov, 366 A.2d 137, 139 (D.C. 1976) (citing Drazin v. Jack Pry, Inc., 154 A.2d 553, 554 (D.C.1959)). In such circumstances, an agent\\'s representations need not expressly be authorized by his principal. The apparent authority of an agent arises when the principal places the agent in such a position as to mislead third persons into believing that the agent is clothed with the authority which in fact he does not possess. Id. at 140. Apparent authority depends upon \"the third-party\\'s perception of the agent\\'s authority.\" Sigal Construction Corp. v. Stanbury, 586 A.2d 1204, 1219 (D.C.1991) (citing RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY \u00a7 27) (other citation omitted). The third party\\'s perception may be based upon \"written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on [her] behalf by the person purporting to act for [her].\" RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY \u00a7 27.\\nThe cases cited by the District in support of apparent authority are distinguishable on the facts. Although the courts in Ashley and Navajo Tribe found the attorneys had apparent authority to settle, the clients in those cases were present in the courtroom.[8] There is an important difference *305 between a settlement reached where the client is present, and therefore has an opportunity to be heard on the matter by all parties, and the case at hand. The settlement proceedings in Fennell; Hayes and Capital Dredge did not take place in court.[9] We express no judgment here as to whether, for out-of-court settlements, apparent authority is sufficient to uphold the validity of a settlement. Sigal Construction, supra, involved the question of whether an employee had apparent authority such that the employer was bound by his statements. Feltman, supra, similarly involved the apparent authority of a lawyer\/employee to bind his client in a lease negotiation. Management Partnership, Inc. v. Crumlin, 423 A.2d 939 (D.C.1980), involved a determination of apparent authority of an employee with respect to a lease agreement. None of these cases addressed the special circumstances of a settlement conference and of the appropriate distinctions, if any, between manifestations of authority in employer-employee relationships and the conveyance of authority in the lawyer-client relationship (which, as noted, necessitates our consideration of ethical conduct and professional responsibility guidelines in addition to contract and agency principles).\\nThe District argues, and the District Court appears to agree, that Makins authorized her attorney to attend the court-ordered settlement conference and to negotiate on her behalf. The District further argues, since Makins held out her attorney as the person with whom the District should deal at the settlement conference, Makins\\' attorney possessed apparent authority to settle her claim. Because Harrison was ordered to attend the conference by the magistrate, however, we find such an \"authorization\" of limited value in evaluating a conveyance of authority. As the Circuit Court majority observed, a \"client\\'s manifestations [of a conveyance of authority] to the third party must be with respect to settlement, not the general conduct of the litigation.\" Makins, 349 U.S.App.D.C. at 310, 277 F.3d at 551 (citing Auvil v. Grafton Homes, Inc., 92 F.3d 226, 230 (4th Cir.1996)). Indeed, the majority notes that if it followed the rule espoused by the District and the apparent authority line of cases, \"an attorney would nearly always have apparent authority to end the case despite the wishes of his client.\" Id.[10]\\nThe District also presents several policy arguments supporting enforcement of settlement agreements on apparent authority grounds, none of which we find compelling. First, it argues the settlement process would be undermined because the third party would never know if the principal\\'s attorney was actually empowered to reach a settlement, and that the third party would either have to require the principal\\'s verification of authority or risk subsequent rescission or denial of the agreement. This argument fails because if a principal forbade settlement then her attorney must disclose this ab initio. By extension, if the principal\\'s attorney in fact actively enters settlement negotiations, then the third party is assured that there are terms to which the principal would agree. Finally, requiring actual authority disposes of the risk of rescission or denial because the third party and presiding official would in fact receive confirmation, by telephone, *306 from the principal that she agreed to the terms of the settlement. Such a requirement poses only a minimal burden on the settlement proceeding. We note that if the principal attends a settlement conference in person, the dangers arising from apparent authority are simply not present.\\nWe are unwilling to extend the power of settlement by way of apparent authority to attorneys who attend settlement negotiations under order of the court when their client is not present to validate the agreement. Accordingly, our answer to the certified question is in the negative.\\nRUIZ, Associate Judge, dissenting:\\nThe majority\\'s answer to the certified question carves out a special exception, for in-court settlements, to our well-established jurisprudence that settlement agreements are enforceable as contracts and that agency principles apply in the context of the lawyer-client relationship. I see no warrant in our cases to justify such a departure. Moreover, there is a risk that the majority\\'s special exception will undermine the policy of encouraging settlement of litigation. Therefore, I dissent and would hold that, as in other contexts, whether a client is bound by the settlement negotiated by a lawyer in court is governed by our well-known agency principles, including apparent authority. Applying those principles to the facts of this case, the District Court judge found that because the District of Columbia was reasonable in its belief that the attorney was authorized to settle on behalf of his client, he was clothed with apparent authority. Therefore, vis \u00e0 vis the District of Columbia, the client is bound by the settlement. If a fact-finder were to determine that the client did not actually authorize her lawyer to agree to the one disputed term of the settlement \\x97 a fact that is assumed for present purposes, but has not been found \\x97 the client\\'s remedy is not to thwart the reasonable expectations of the District of Columbia, but to sue her attorney for malpractice.\\nThere is no question that settlement agreements are contracts and are enforceable as such. See Goozh v. Capitol Souvenir Co., 462 A.2d 1140, 1142 (D.C.1983). Nor is it disputed that a principal is bound by a contract entered into by an authorized agent. See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY \u00a7 140 (1958) (\"The liability of the principal to a third person upon a transaction conducted by an agent, ... may be based upon the fact that ... the agent was apparently authorized.\"). The agent may have \"actual\" authority derived from the consent of the principal given to the agent, see id. at \u00a7 7 (\"Authority is the power of the agent to affect the legal relations of the principal by acts done in accordance with the principal\\'s manifestations of consent to [the agent].\"), or \"apparent\" authority based on words or actions of the principal to a third person which lead that third person reasonably to believe that the agent is authorized to act for the principal in the matter at hand. See Feltman v. Sarbov, 366 A.2d 137, 139-40 (D.C.1976); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY \u00a7 8 (1958). The majority does not take issue with these basic principles of contract and agency law.\\nNotwithstanding clear law, the majority considers that settlement agreements that are reached in court, however, should be treated as an exception to the general law of contract and agency. The majority holds that with respect to in-court settlements, a client is bound only if a lawyer has actual authority.[1] It finds its support *307 in two sources, both of which are inapposite. In Bronson v. Borst, 404 A.2d 960 (D.C.1979), we stated that \"regardless of the good faith of the attorney, absent specific authority, an attorney cannot accept a settlement offer on behalf of a client.\" Id. at 963. But Bronson is easily distinguishable as it involved a lawsuit brought by an attorney against his client to enforce a contract the attorney had negotiated without actual authority in order to collect his contingent fee from the client. See id. at 961.[2]Bronson did not involve the interests of a third person, and therefore, the court in that case had no occasion to focus on the principles of agency law presented by the case before us. The majority also relies on the Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 1.2(a), which provides that \"[a] lawyer shall abide by a client\\'s decision whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter.\" But this rule is concerned with a lawyer\\'s obligation to a client, and as authority for the certified question suffers from the same deficiency as Bronson: it says nothing about the interests of third persons. Moreover, if Bronson and Rule 1.2(a) are authoritative on the issue of a third person\\'s right to rely on an agent\\'s apparent authority, the majority\\'s reasoning would not be limited to the situation of in-court settlements presented in the certified question because no settlement agreed to by a lawyer without actual authority would be binding on a client whether reached in court or in a law office.\\nAgency law developed as a way of facilitating commerce and transactions by laying down rules that permit principals to expand the scope and effectiveness of their activities by acting through agents. See 1 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES ON THE LAWS OF ENGLAND * 418 (1765) (\"[W]ithout such a doctrine as this, no mutual intercourse between man and man could subsist without any tolerable convenience.\") Since Blackstone\\'s time, the practice of acting through agents has become so entrenched that it is an entirely unremarkable and frequent occurrence in this city and across the country that lawyers, in the course of representing their clients, negotiate and enter into contracts on behalf of their clients. These contracts can arise in commercial transactions, or in settling litigation\\x97sometimes in court, sometimes outside of court. In acting for their clients, a lawyer\\'s actions are governed by principles of agency law. As explained in the Restatement:\\nA lawyer\\'s act is considered to be that of the client in proceedings before a tribunal or in dealings with a third person if the tribunal or third person reasonably assumes that the lawyer is authorized to do the act on the basis of the client\\'s (and not the lawyer\\'s) manifestations of authorization. *308 RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF THE LAW GOVERNING LAWYERS \u00a7 27 (2000). With respect to settlement agreements, the general rule is that \"a client is not bound by a settlement that the client has not authorized a lawyer to make by express, implied, or apparent authority....\" Id. cmt. d. (emphasis added). As with other agents, a lawyer has apparent authority \"when and to the extent a client causes a third person to form a reasonable belief that a lawyer is authorized to act for the client.\" Id. \u00a7 27 cmt. b. The majority\\'s special rule requiring actual authority for in-court settlements is a step backwards from the long tradition recognized by Blackstone and accepted in the Restatement.\\n\\n\"The existence of apparent authority is a question of fact.\" Feltman, 366 A.2d at 140. Based on the record in this case, the United States District Court found that the attorney had apparent authority, and that, as a result, Ms. Makins is bound by the terms of the agreement her lawyer negotiated to settle her lawsuit against the District of Columbia. In evaluating whether an agent has apparent authority, we ask whether the \"principal [the client] place[d] the agent [the lawyer] in a position which cause[d] a third person to reasonably believe the principal had consented to the exercise of authority the agent purports to hold.\" Feltman, 366 A.2d at 139 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Thus, although the focus is on the principal\\'s actions, their effect is evaluated through the eyes of a reasonable third person. In this case, the court had ordered that the lawyers be present at the settlement conference and that the \"parties shall either attend the settlement conference or be available by telephone for the duration of the settlement conference\" \\x97 a clear indication to the participants that the purpose of the conference was to agree on final and binding terms.[3] Ms. Makins was aware of the purpose of the conference and that she could attend and participate if she wished. She knew that her lawyer was going to attend the settlement conference on her behalf and acquiesced in her lawyer\\'s advice that she not attend the conference. Ms. Makins acknowledged that she spoke to her lawyer several times during the conference. At the conference, Ms. Makins\\'s lawyer represented to the District\\'s lawyer and to the court that he was consulting with his client by telephone, a procedure which had been expressly envisioned in the court\\'s order. From the perspective of the District of Columbia\\'s lawyer, who was aware of the terms of the court\\'s order, it was reasonable to believe that Ms. Makins had authorized her lawyer to settle the case on her behalf. This belief is made more, not less, reasonable by the circumstance that the lawyer\\'s actions took place in court, where a lawyer has a professional obligation not only to his client, but also as an officer of the court. See Ashley v. Atlas Mfg. Co., 7 F.R.D. 77 (D.D.C.1946) (client bound by counsel\\'s in-court agreement to settlement terms where counsel made \"a categorical, unambiguous, unequivocal statement which could lead to no other conclusion both in the minds of opposing *309 counsel and the Court, but that counsel had full authority,\" and court was unwilling to believe that \"counsel should make such a statement without authority\").[4] That Rule 2.1(a) of the Rules of Professional Responsibility requires a lawyer to follow a client\\'s decision in settling a case adds further weight to a third person\\'s belief that a lawyer has been authorized by the client to accept a settlement because it is more reasonable to expect that a lawyer will act consistent with professional obligations than that a lawyer will disregard them, particularly since, as discussed below, that disregard can subject the lawyer to legal liability and professional sanction. If the evidence was sufficient to support the District Court\\'s finding that Ms. Makins put her lawyer in a situation such that the District of Columbia reasonably believed that Ms. Makins\\'s attorney was authorized to settle the litigation, her lawyer had apparent authority to enter into the settlement agreement, and it is enforceable by the District against Ms. Makins.[5]\\nThat the District\\'s reasonable reliance on the lawyer\\'s authority and expectation interest in the settlement it negotiated are protected by principles of agency and contract law does not mean that Ms. Makins is without recourse if, in fact, her lawyer acted without actual authority and caused her to incur a loss \\x97 a fact-finding that the District Court judge chose not to make here because the testimony of Ms. Makins and her lawyer were at odds. If that is the case, however, she has a cause of action for beach of contract or legal malpractice against her lawyer. See Glekas v. Boss &amp; Phelps, Inc., 437 A.2d 584, 587 (D.C.1981) (holding that an agent\\'s breach of duty is equivalent to breach of contractual obligation); Ashley, 7 F.R.D. at 77 (\"If, as a matter of fact, counsel had no authority, then the resulting difficulty is between him and his client.\"); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY \u00a7 401 cmt. e (1958) (\"If an agent acts contrary to the principal\\'s orders ..., and a loss to the principal results from such disobedience or failure to act, the agent is subject to liability [to the principal] for such loss if such loss is within the risk created by the disobedience ...\"); RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF THE LAW GOVERNING LAWYERS \u00a7 27 cmt. f (2000) (\"When a client is bound by an act of a lawyer with apparent but not actual authority, a lawyer is subject to liability to a client for any resulting damages to the client, unless the lawyer reasonably believed that the act was authorized by the client.\"). In this manner, liability is properly placed on the person who acted improperly, without upsetting a legally enforceable contract.[6] A lawyer who violates rules of professional conduct by binding a *310 client outside the scope of actual authority can also be sanctioned through professional disciplinary proceedings, or, in an appropriate case, the court may impose a procedural sanction. See id. The real risk of exposure to liability and professional sanction cannot be discounted as effective checks on a lawyer\\'s unfounded representation that settlement is authorized by the client.\\nBeyond protecting the legitimate interests of the parties in this case, it is important to take into account the public policy that favors settlement of litigation. Thus, we should lay down rules that are conducive to negotiating settlements without unnecessary constraints. The special exception that the majority adopts disfavors in-court settlements by creating a cloud over the enforceability of an agreement unless the other party is satisfied that it is dealing with an attorney who has actual authority. But how is this to be done? A settlement is the result of a negotiation that involves discussion and give-and-take. In the delicate and fluid atmosphere of settlement negotiations, parties usually think it is to their advantage to keep their ultimate settlement position close to the vest. It would be counterproductive to require disclosure of the \"bottom line\" terms that a client will accept in order to assure the opposing party that the lawyer has actual authority. So the realistic options are that the client must personally agree to the terms at each stage of negotiations or that the client must give the lawyer \"carte blanche\" at the outset. Neither option is conducive to settlements because one is so restrictive as to eliminate the benefit of acting through an agent and the other requires the principal to cede all discretion to the agent.\\nThere are other practical considerations. As the facts in this case demonstrate, lawyers often counsel their clients to stay away from court settlement conferences as a way of reducing direct pressure to settle by the court. This time-tested technique of haggling at the bazaar as well as in settlement conferences gives the agent room to maneuver when considering and countering a settlement offer. Indeed, it is probably precisely because the court was well aware of this dynamic and the potential for backsliding if the lawyer reserves the right to consult with the client that it ordered the District to have at all \"settlement meetings ... an individual with full settlement authority\" and Ms. Makins either to be present in court or accessible by telephone. See supra note 3. If a third person knows an in-court settlement with counsel in conditioned on the client\\'s sign-off, the third person may be well-advised to hold back on the terms of settlement in order to protect against the risk that the client will not ratify the agreement unless there is an additional concession. This kind of gamesmanship does not promote settlements.\\nFinally, the majority\\'s special exception seems particularly unnecessary in the case of in-court settlements. Even though they are private agreements the terms of which cannot be dictated by the court, settlements conducted under the guidance of a judicial officer who has reviewed the merits of the underlying litigation and discussed them with the parties bear some assurance that the terms agreed upon are fair.\\nFor the foregoing reasons I would answer the certified question in the affirmative.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Makins v. District of Columbia, 349 U.S.App.D.C. 303, 312, 277 F.3d 544, 553 (2002). Earlier in its decision, the Circuit Court phrases the question somewhat differently: \"may an attorney negotiating in the client\\'s absence bind the client to a settlement agreement if the attorney has led opposing counsel to believe he had actual authority from the client to settle the case?\" Id. at 308, 277 F.3d at 549. Our answer is the same either way.\\n[2]  See generally Jeffrey A. Parness &amp; Austin W. Bartlett, Unsettling Questions Regarding Lawyer Civil Claim Settlement Authority, 78 OR. L.

Borst, 404 A.2d 960 (D.C.1979).\\n[5]  With due respect to the Circuit Court\\'s dissenting opinion, we hold that, while there is no meaningful difference between the \"specific authority\" referred to in Bronson and the term \"actual authority\" as we use it here, \"apparent authority\" can and should be understood as wholly different in meaning from specific or actual authority.\\n[6]  This holding is echoed in the District of Columbia Code of Professional Responsibility Ethical Consideration 7-7 (EC 7-7), which provides that it is the exclusive authority of \"the client to decide whether he will accept a settlement offer ....\" Similarly, District of Columbia Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2(a) (2001) provides that a \"lawyer shall abide by a client\\'s decision whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter.\"\\n[7]  As a general rule, \"it is well established that settlement agreements are entitled to enforcement under general principles of contract law....\" Goozh v. Capitol Souvenir Co., 462 A.2d 1140, 1142 (D.C.1983) (quoting Brown v. Brown, 343 A.2d 59, 61 (D.C.1975)).\\n[8]  Ashley, supra; Navajo Tribe of Indians v.

Detroit, 800 F.2d 525 (6th Cir. 1986).\\n[10]  In such a scenario, the client\\'s only remedy against a settlement reached without her consent would be to sue her attorney. By clearly delineating the authority required, our holding in this case obviates that highly lamentable outcome as well.\\n[1]  In its opinion the majority suggests that because the attorney was ordered to appear in court, the fact that he was present \"was of limited value in evaluating a conveyance of authority.\" The majority\\'s conclusion that the settlement agreement is not enforceable does not rest on a determination that there was no apparent authority on the facts of this case, however, but on a special rule that requires actual authority for all in-court settlements.\\n[2]  Bronson was also very different on the facts. As opposed to the situation before us where the attorney testified that the client had authorized him to accept the settlement and the client not only knew that the attorney was attending a settlement conference on her behalf but also acknowledged that her lawyer consulted with her during the negotiations but disputed that she had agreed to settle without an offer of a job, in Bronson there was no possibility that the lawyer may have thought he was authorized to accept the settlement agreement as the lawyer testified that he accepted the proffered settlement even though the client had \"made it clear to [the attorney] that he would not accept the offer of settlement\" and had stopped communicating with the lawyer. 404 A.2d at 961.\\n[3]  When the court referred the matter to the magistrate for settlement purposes, it ordered the District to \"have present at all settlement meetings ... an individual with full settlement authority.\" As the majority notes, the court\\'s order did not contain a similar instruction addressed to Ms. Makins. That is more likely a reflection of the court\\'s experience with the manner in which bureaucratic institutions such as governments and corporations operate, than an indication that it expected to set up a lopsided negotiation where only one side of the litigation would be in a position to reach a final settlement. Rather, the court most likely did not feel a need to order that Ms. Makins\\'s lawyer be fully authorized to settle her case because it assumed that would be the case.\\n[4]  As the majority notes, the court in Ashley stated that an attorney cannot bind a client to a settlement without \"specific authority.\" This statement is unsupported by any citation. The majority also attempts to distinguish Ashley on the basis that the client was present in court when counsel agreed to the terms of the settlement. Although it is possible \\x97 though by no means certain \\x97 to glean that fact from the court\\'s opinion, it is irrelevant to the court\\'s analysis which, as mentioned in the text, relied on counsel\\'s \"categorical, unambiguous, unequivocal\" statements in court. There is no suggestion that counsel\\'s representations in the case before us were any less definitive.\\n[5]  Review of the District Court\\'s finding is properly the function of our federal counterpart, applying District of Columbia law as set out in our answer to the certified question.\\n[6]  Where the lawyer does not have apparent authority and therefore does not bind the client, the lawyer may be subject to liability to a third person who relied on the lawyer\\'s representations in good faith based on implied warranty of actual authority or misrepresentation.

In November 1998, Brenda Makins brought an action against the District of Columbia claiming sex discrimination and retaliatory firing, in violation of Title VII (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq.). Makins had been employed in the District\u2019s Department of Corrections from 1995 until her discharge in 1997. Her complaint sought reinstatement, compensatory damages, and attorney\u2019s fees.\\nMakins\u2019 attorney, John Harrison, began representing her in 1996, after she received notice of termination from the Department. Harrison and Makins did not have a written retainer agreement. In the summer of 2000, at a pre-trial conference, the district judge referred Makins\u2019 case to a magistrate judge \u201cfor settlement purposes only\u201d and ordered the District to \u201chave present at all settlement meetings ... an individual with full settlement authority.\u201d A similar admonition was absent as to Ms. Makins. The judge set the ease for trial in December 2000. A few days later, the magistrate ordered the \u201clead attorney(s) for the parties\u201d to appear before him for a settlement conference; the *302order required that the \u201cparties shall either attend the settlement conference or be available by telephone for the duration of the settlement conference.\u201d\\nThe conference took place on September 12, 2000. Makins was not present. After two and half hours of negotiations, Harrison and the attorneys for the District reached an agreement. Makins would receive $99,000 and have her personnel records amended from \u201cdischarged\u201d to \u201cresigned\u201d (to preserve her retirement benefits if she were able to attain other creditable employment). In return, Makins would dismiss her claims against the District. The attorneys \u201cshook hands\u201d on the deal and later reduced it to writing. A few days later, when Harrison presented Makins with a copy for her signature, she refused to sign it. The District then filed a Motion to Enforce Settlement. Makins retained another attorney, and the court held an evi-dentiary hearing in which Harrison, Ma-kins, and the lead attorney for the District testified.\\nThe testimony of Makins and Harrison was at odds. According to Makins, she never agreed to settle her case under the terms Harrison and the District negotiated because \u201cgetting [her] job back had to be part of any agreement.\u201d She admitted to wanting to settle the case and knowing that the correctional facility in which she had worked was closing. She claimed that Harrison waited until the night before the conference to alert her to it and specifically told her not to attend. She talked to Harrison several times during the settlement negotiations on September 12. But she insisted that she never agreed to the negotiated terms because, as she expressed to Harrison in one of their cell phone conversations that day, getting her job back was a condition to settling the case. Although Makins swore in an affidavit, filed before the hearing, that Harrison alerted her during the negotiations that he was discussing the $99,000 figure, she testified that she did not recall such a conversation.\\nHarrison disputed much of Makins\u2019 testimony. He said they had extensively discussed the possibility of settlement the day before the conference and that he thought it made sense strategically for his client to remain at home so that \u201cthe Judge couldn\u2019t put pressure on her to settle.\u201d Harrison also testified that he discouraged Makins .from insisting on getting her job back. According to Harrison, Makins gave him a number where he could reach her on September 12, and told him to do \u201cwhat you think is right, I trust you.\u201d\\nAt the conference, each side presented its case separately to the magistrate. The attorneys and the magistrate then sat at a table and negotiations began. On several occasions, the magistrate sent one of the attorneys out of the room and talked to the other about what he saw as strengths and weaknesses in the case. By cell phone, Harrison called Makins when he was out of the room. He contends that she agreed to settle for $99,000. Harrison testified that when the District agreed to this figure, he called Makins immediately and \u201ctold her the 99 was done,\u201d to which she replied \u201cgood.\u201d Harrison also stated that Makins did not express any dissatisfaction with the settlement until several days later when she refused to sign the papers in Harrison\u2019s office.\\nThe District\u2019s attorney generally confirmed Harrison\u2019s account of the conference (although he did not know what Harrison and his client had discussed by cell phone, or even if they had discussion). In response to the District\u2019s offer of approximately $80,000, Harrison said his client was still at $120,000, or thereabouts. The District\u2019s attorney replied that he would *303not settle the ease for more than $100,000. Harrison left the room, cell phone in hand, and came back a few minutes later. He said $99,000 would be fine but his client wanted her records changed to show that she had resigned. The District reluctantly-agreed. Neither the attorney for the District nor the magistrate spoke to Makins to confirm her assent to the terms of the agreement.\\nThe District Court, observing the \u201csharp conflict\u201d in testimony between Makins and Harrison, declined to resolve it. Instead, the court assumed arguendo that Harrison did not have actual authority to settle the case. The court granted the District\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement on the alternative ground that Harrison had apparent authority to bind Makins to the agreement. The court saw \u201cno justification for the District of Columbia not to reasonably believe that Mr. Harrison had the full confidence and authority of his client.\u201d\\nII.\\nThere is some confusion as to both the degree of authority required of an attorney in settlement negotiations.2 Indeed, a review of relevant case law and principles enunciated by the American Bar Association and the American Law Institute demonstrate widespread dissonance not only over the degree of authority, but also the appropriate definitions of authority. We hold that, while attorneys must have some inherent procedural and tactical authority on behalf of clients, for in-court settlement proceedings that attorneys for the parties are ordered to attend, the client must give actual authority to settle the case in the client\u2019s absence.3\\nWe deem the situation at hand sufficiently analogous to our decision in Bronson v. Borst4 and distinguishable from our holdings in other cases as discussed below. Actual authority, which may also be referred to as delegated or specific authority, focuses on the client\/lawyer relationship. In Bronson, an attorney sued his former client for declaratory judgment to enforce a settlement agreement that the attorney had accepted and entered into on his client\u2019s behalf. We held that \u201cabsent specific authority, an attorney cannot accept a settlement offer on behalf of a client.\u201d Bronson, supra note 4, 404 A.2d at 963.5 We reached that holding through an analysis of \u201cactions which counsel was neither duty bound nor authorized to perform.\u201d Id. at 962. To be sure, Bronson differs from the case at hand on this point since Bronson did not involve a settlement conference and Harrison was duty bound, by order of the magistrate judge, to attend the settlement conference and participate in negotiations on Makins\u2019 behalf. Moreover, this is an action by the other party to the settlement rather than the attorney or the client. *304Nonetheless, Bronson addresses the principle that a client\u2019s approval is required \u201cregardless of the merits of the ... case or the attractiveness of the settlement offer.\u201d Id. at 962. Contrary to the District\u2019s argument before this court, the Bronson holding is consonant with the decision in Ashley v. Atlas Mfg. Co., 7 F.R.D. 77 (D.D.C.1946), aff\\'d, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 399, 166 F.2d 209 (1947). In Ashley, the court found specific authority arising from an in-court proceeding based in part on the fact that, unlike here, the client\u2019s attorney announced the settlement agreement in the client\u2019s presence. The Ashley court recognized the general rule that an attorney shall not enter settlement without actual authority.6 Id.\\nWe distinguish our holding here from the line of cases finding apparent authority based on contract theory.7 The Restatement (Seoond) of Agency \u00a7 8 (1958) defines apparent authority as \u201cthe power to affect the legal relations of another person by transactions with third persons, professedly as an agent for the other, arising from and in accordance with the other\u2019s manifestations to such third persons.\u201d Thus, unlike actual authority, apparent authority does not depend upon any manifestation from the principal to her agent, but rather from the principal to the third party. Restatement (Seoond) of AgeNCY \u00a7 27, cmt. a. This court has stated that apparent authority arises when a principal placed an agent \u201cin a position which causes a third person to reasonably believe the principal had consented to the exercise of authority the agent purports to hold. This falls short of an overt, affirmative representation by a principal .... \u201d Feltman v. Sarbov, 366 A.2d 137, 139 (D.C.1976) (citing Drazin v. Jack Pry, Inc., 154 A.2d 553, 554 (D.C.1959)). In such circumstances, an agent\u2019s representations need not expressly be authorized by his principal. The apparent authority of an agent arises when the principal places the agent in such a position as to mislead third persons into believing that the agent is clothed with the authority which in fact he does not possess. Id. at 140. Apparent authority depends upon \u201cthe third-party\u2019s perception of the agent\u2019s authority.\u201d Sigal Construction Corp. v. Stanbury, 586 A.2d 1204, 1219 (D.C.1991) (citing Restatement (Seoond) of Agenoy \u00a7 27) (other citation omitted). The third party\u2019s perception may be based upon \u201cwritten or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on [her] behalf by the person purporting to act for [her].\u201d Restatement (Seoond) of Agency \u00a7 27.\\nThe cases cited by the District in support of apparent authority are distinguishable on the facts. Although the courts in Ashley and Navajo Tribe found the attorneys had apparent authority to settle, the clients in those cases were present in the courtroom.8 There is an important differ*305ence between a settlement reached where the client is present, and therefore has an opportunity to be heard on the matter by all parties, and the case at hand. The settlement proceedings in Fennell; Hayes and Capital Dredge did not take place in court.9 We express no judgment here as to whether, for out-of-court settlements, apparent authority is sufficient to uphold the validity of a settlement. Sigal Con-stmction, supra, involved the question of whether an employee had apparent authority such that the employer was bound by his statements. Feltman, supra, similarly involved the apparent authority of a lawyer\/employee to bind his client in a lease negotiation. Management Partnership, Inc. v. Crumlin, 423 A.2d 939 (D.C.1980), involved a determination of apparent authority of an employee with respect to a lease agreement. None of these cases addressed the special circumstances of a settlement conference and of the appropriate distinctions, if any, between manifestations of authority in employer-employee relationships and the conveyance of authority in the lawyer-client relationship (which, as noted, necessitates our consideration of ethical conduct and professional responsibility guidelines in addition to contract and agency principles).\\nThe District argues, and the District Court appears to agree, that Makins authorized her attorney to attend the court-ordered settlement conference and to negotiate on her behalf. The District further argues, since Makins held out her attorney as the person with whom the District should deal at the settlement conference, Makins\u2019 attorney possessed apparent authority to settle her claim. Because Harrison was ordered to attend the conference by the magistrate, however, we find such an \u201cauthorization\u201d of limited value in evaluating a conveyance of authority. As the Circuit Court majority observed, a \u201cclient\u2019s manifestations [of a conveyance of authority] to the third party must be with respect to settlement, not the general conduct of the litigation.\u201d Makins, 349 U.S.App.D.C. at 310, 277 F.3d at 551 (citing Auvil v. Grafton Homes, Inc., 92 F.3d 226, 230 (4th Cir.1996)). Indeed, the majority notes that if it followed the rule espoused by the District and the apparent authority line of cases, \u201can attorney would nearly always have apparent authority to end the case despite the wishes of his client.\u201d Id.10\\nThe District also presents several policy arguments supporting enforcement of settlement agreements on apparent authority grounds, none of which we find compelling. First, it argues the settlement process would be undermined because the third party would never know if the principal\u2019s attorney was actually empowered to reach a settlement, and that the third party would either have to require the principal\u2019s verification of authority or risk subsequent rescission or denial of the agreement. This argument fails because if a principal forbade settlement then her attorney must disclose this ab initio. By extension, if the principal\u2019s attorney in fact actively enters settlement negotiations, then the third party is assured that there are terms to which the principal would agree. Finally, requiring actual authority disposes of the risk of rescission or denial because the third party and presiding official would in fact receive confirmation, by telephone, *306from the principal that she agreed to the terms of the settlement. Such a requirement poses only a minimal burden on the settlement proceeding. We note that if the principal attends a settlement conference in person, the dangers arising from apparent authority are simply not present.\\nWe are unwilling to extend the power of settlement by way of apparent authority to attorneys who attend settlement negotiations under order of the court when their client is not present to validate the agreement. Accordingly, our answer to the certified question is in the negative.\\n\\n. Makins v. District of Columbia, 349 U.S.App.D.C. 303, 312, 277 F.3d 544, 553 (2002).

I see no warrant in our cases to justify such a departure. Moreover, there is a risk that the majority\u2019s special exception will undermine the policy of encouraging settlement of litigation. Therefore, I dissent and would hold that, as in other contexts, whether a client is bound by the settlement negotiated by a lawyer in court is governed by our well-known agency principles, including apparent authority. Applying those principles to the facts of this case, the District Court judge found that because the District of Columbia was reasonable in its belief that the attorney was authorized to settle on behalf of his client, he was clothed with apparent authority. Therefore, vis a vis the District of Columbia, the client is bound by the settlement. If a fact-finder were to determine that the client did not actually authorize her lawyer to agree to the one disputed term of the settlement \u2014 a fact that is assumed for present purposes, but has not been found \u2014 the client\u2019s remedy is not to thwart the reasonable expectations of the District of Columbia, but to sue her attorney for malpractice.\\nThere is no question that settlement agreements are contracts and are enforceable as such. See Goozh v. Capitol Souvenir Co., 462 A.2d 1140, 1142 (D.C.1983). Nor is it disputed that a principal is bound by a contract entered into by an authorized agent. See Restatement (Second) op Agency \u00a7 140 (1958) (\u201cThe liability of the principal to a third person upon a transaction conducted by an agent, ... may be based upon the fact that ... the agent was apparently authorized.\u201d). The agent may have \u201cactual\u201d authority derived from the consent of the principal given to the agent, see id. at \u00a7 7 (\u201cAuthority is the power of the agent to affect the legal relations of the principal by acts done in accordance with the principal\u2019s manifestations of consent to [the agent].\u201d), or \u201capparent\u201d authority based on words or actions of the principal to a third person which lead that third person reasonably to believe that the agent is authorized to act for the principal in the matter at hand. See Feltman v. Sarbov, 366 A.2d 137, 139-40 (D.C.1976); Restatement (Second) of Agenoy \u00a7 8 (1958). The majority does not take issue with these basic principles of contract and agency law.\\nNotwithstanding clear law, the majority considers that settlement agreements that are reached in court, however, should be treated as an exception to the general law of contract and agency. The majority holds that with respect to in-court settlements, a client is bound only if a lawyer has actual authority.1 It finds its support *307in two sources, both of which are inappo-site. In Bronson v. Borst, 404 A.2d 960 (D.C.1979), we stated that \u201cregardless of the good faith of the attorney, absent specific authority, an attorney cannot accept a settlement offer on behalf of a client.\u201d Id. at 963. But Bronson is easily distinguishable as it involved a lawsuit brought by an attorney against his client to enforce a contract the attorney had negotiated without actual authority in order to collect his contingent fee from the client. See id. at 961.2 Bronson did not involve the interests of a third person, and therefore, the court in that case had no occasion to focus on the principles of agency law presented by the case before us. The majority also relies on the Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 1.2(a), which provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decision whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter.\u201d But this rule is concerned with a lawyer\u2019s obligation to a client, and as authority for the certified question suffers from the same deficiency as Bronson: it says nothing about the interests of third persons. Moreover, if Bronson and Rule 1.2(a) are authoritative on the issue of a third person\u2019s right to rely on an agent\u2019s apparent authority, the majority\u2019s reasoning would not be limited to the situation of in-court settlements presented in the certified question because no settlement agreed to by a lawyer without actual authority would be binding on a client whether reached in court or in a law office.\\nAgency law developed as a way of facilitating commerce and transactions by laying down rules that permit principals to expand the scope and effectiveness of their activities by acting through agents. See 1 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England * 418 (1765) (\u201c[Wjithout such a doctrine as this, no mutual intercourse between man and man could subsist without any tolerable convenience.\u201d) Since Blackstone\u2019s time, the practice of acting through agents has become so entrenched that it is an entirely unremarkable and frequent occurrence in this city and across the country that lawyers, in the course of representing their clients, negotiate and enter into contracts on behalf of their clients. These contracts can arise in commercial transactions, or in settling litigation \u2014 sometimes in court, sometimes outside of court. In acting for them clients, a lawyer\u2019s actions are governed by principles of agency law. As explained in the Restatement:\\nA lawyer\u2019s act is considered to be that of the client in proceedings before a tribunal or in dealings with a third person if the tribunal or third person reasonably assumes that the lawyer is authorized to do the act on the basis of the client\u2019s (and not the lawyer\u2019s) manifestations of authorization.\\n*308Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing LawyeRS \u00a7 27 (2000). With respect to settlement agreements, the general rule is that \u201ca client is not bound by a settlement that the client has not authorized a lawyer to make by express, implied, or apparent authority....\u201d Id. cmt. d. (emphasis added). As with other agents, a lawyer has apparent authority \u201cwhen and to the extent a client causes a third person to form a reasonable belief that a lawyer is authorized to act for the client.\u201d Id. \u00a7 27 cmt. b. The majority\u2019s special rule requiring actual authority for in-court settlements is a step backwards from the long tradition recognized by Blackstone and accepted in the Restatement.\\n\u201cThe existence of apparent authority is a question of fact.\u201d Feltman, 366 A.2d at 140. Based on the record in this case, the United States District Court found that the attorney had apparent authority, and that, as a result, Ms. Makins is bound by the terms of the agreement her lawyer negotiated to settle her lawsuit against the District of Columbia. In evaluating whether an agent has apparent authority, we ask whether the \u201cprincipal [the client] place[d] the agent [the lawyer] in a position which causefd] a third person to reasonably believe the principal had consented to the exercise of authority the agent purports to hold.\u201d Feltman, 366 A.2d at 139 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Thus, although the focus is on the principal\u2019s actions, their effect is evaluated through the eyes of a reasonable third person. In this case, the court had ordered that the lawyers be present at the settlement conference and that the \u201cparties shall either attend the settlement conference or be available by telephone for the duration of the settlement conference\u201d \u2014 a clear indication to the participants that the purpose of the conference was to agree on final and binding terms.3 Ms. Makins was aware of the purpose of the conference and that she could attend and participate if she wished. She knew that her lawyer was going to attend the settlement conference on her behalf and acquiesced in her lawyer\u2019s advice that she not attend the conference. Ms. Makins acknowledged that she spoke to her lawyer several times during the conference. At the conference, Ms. Makins\u2019s lawyer represented to the District\u2019s lawyer and to the court that he was consulting with his client by telephone, a procedure which had been expressly envisioned in the court\u2019s order. From the perspective of the District of Columbia\u2019s lawyer, who was aware of the terms of the court\u2019s order, it was reasonable to believe that Ms. Makins had authorized her lawyer to settle the case on her behalf. This belief is made more, not less, reasonable by the circumstance that the lawyer\u2019s actions took place in court, where a lawyer has a professional obligation not only to his client, but also as an officer of the court. See Ashley v. Atlas Mfg. Co., 7 F.R.D. 77 (D.D.C.1946) (client bound by counsel\u2019s in-court agreement to settlement terms where counsel made \u201ca categorical, unambiguous, unequivocal statement which could lead to no other conclusion both in the minds of opposing *309counsel and the Court, but that counsel had full authority,\u201d and court was unwilling to believe that \u201ccounsel should make such a statement without authority\u201d)-4 That Rule 2.1(a) of the Rules of Professional Responsibility requires a lawyer to follow a client\u2019s decision in settling a case adds further weight to a third person\u2019s belief that a lawyer has been authorized by the client to accept a settlement because it is more reasonable to expect that a lawyer will act consistent with professional obligations than that a lawyer will disregard them, particularly since, as discussed below, that disregard can subject the lawyer to legal liability and professional sanction. If the evidence was sufficient to support the District Court\u2019s finding that Ms. Ma-kins put her lawyer in a situation such that the District of Columbia reasonably believed that Ms. Makins\u2019s attorney was authorized to settle the litigation, her lawyer had apparent authority to enter into the settlement agreement, and it is enforceable by the District against Ms. Makins.5\\nThat the District\u2019s reasonable reliance on the lawyer\u2019s authority and expectation interest in the settlement it negotiated are protected by principles of agency and contract law does not mean that Ms. Makins is without recourse if, in fact, her lawyer acted without actual authority and caused her to incur a loss \u2014 a fact-finding that the District Court judge chose not to make here because the testimony of Ms. Makins and her lawyer were at odds. If that is the case, however, she has a cause of action for beach of contract or legal malpractice against her lawyer. See Glekas v. Boss &amp; Phelps, Inc., 437 A.2d 584, 587 (D.C.1981) (holding that an agent\u2019s breach of duty is equivalent to breach of contractual obligation); Ashley, 7 F.R.D. at 77 (\u201cIf, as a matter of fact, counsel had no authority, then the resulting difficulty is between him and his client.\u201d); Restatement (Second) op Agency \u00a7 401 cmt. e (1958) (\u201cIf an agent acts contrary to the principal\u2019s orders ..., and a loss to the principal results from such disobedience or failure to act, the agent is subject to liability [to the principal] for such loss if such loss is within the risk created by the disobedience ... \u201d); Restatement (ThiRd) op the Law GoverniNG Lawyers \u00a7 27 cmt. f (2000) (\u201cWhen a client is bound by an act of a lawyer with apparent but not actual authority, a lawyer is subject to liability to a client for any resulting damages to the client, unless the lawyer reasonably believed that the act was authorized by the client.\u201d). In this manner, liability is properly placed on the person who acted improperly, without upsetting a legally enforceable contract.6 A lawyer who violates rules of professional conduct by binding a *310client outside the scope of actual authority can also be sanctioned through professional disciplinary proceedings, or, in an appropriate case, the court may impose a procedural sanction. See id. The real risk of exposure to liability and professional sanction cannot be discounted as effective checks on a lawyer\u2019s unfounded representation that settlement is authorized by the client.\\nBeyond protecting the legitimate interests of the parties in this case, it is important to take into account the public policy that favors settlement of litigation. Thus, we should lay down rules that are conducive to negotiating settlements without unnecessary constraints. The special exception that the majority adopts disfavors in-court settlements by creating a cloud over the enforceability of an agreement unless the other party is satisfied that it is dealing with an attorney who has actual authority. But how is this to be done? A settlement is the result of a negotiation that involves discussion and give-and-take. In the delicate and fluid atmosphere of settlement negotiations, parties usually think it is to their advantage to keep their ultimate settlement position close to the vest. It would be counterproductive to require disclosure of the \u201cbottom line\u201d terms that a client will accept in order to assure the opposing party that the lawyer has actual authority. So the realistic options are that the client must personally agree to the terms at each stage of negotiations or that the client must give the lawyer \u201ccarte blanche\u201d at the outset. Neither option is conducive to settlements because one is so restrictive as to eliminate the benefit of acting through an agent and the other requires the principal to cede all discretion to the agent.\\nThere are other practical considerations. As the facts in this case demonstrate, lawyers often counsel their clients to stay away from court settlement conferences as a way of reducing direct pressure to settle by the court. This time-tested technique of haggling at the bazaar as well as in settlement conferences gives the agent room to maneuver when considering and countering a settlement offer. Indeed, it is probably precisely because the court was well aware of this dynamic and the potential for backsliding if the lawyer reserves the right to consult with the client that it ordered the District to have at all \u201csettlement meetings ... an individual with full settlement authority\u201d and Ms. Makins either to be present in court or accessible by telephone. See supra note 3. If a third person knows an in-court settlement with counsel in conditioned on the client\u2019s sign-off, the third person may be well-advised to hold back on the terms of settlement in order to protect against the risk that the client will not ratify the agreement unless there is an additional concession. This kind of gamesmanship does not promote settlements.\\nFinally, the majority\u2019s special exception seems particularly unnecessary in the case of in-court settlements. Even though they are private agreements the terms of which cannot be dictated by the court, settlements conducted under the guidance of a judicial officer who has reviewed the merits of the underlying litigation and discussed them with the parties bear some assurance that the terms agreed upon are fair.\\nFor the foregoing reasons I would answer the certified question in the affirmative.\\n\\n. In its opinion the majority suggests that because the attorney was ordered to appear in court, the fact that he was present \u201cwas of limited value in evaluating a conveyance of *307authority.\u201d The majority\\'s conclusion that the settlement agreement is not enforceable does not rest on a determination that there was no apparent authority on the facts of this case, however, but on a special rule that requires actual authority for all in-court settlements.\\n\\n\\n. Bronson was also very different on the facts. As opposed to the situation before us where the attorney testified that the client had authorized him to accept the settlement and the client not only knew that the attorney was attending a settlement conference on her behalf but also acknowledged that her lawyer consulted with her during the negotiations but disputed that she had agreed to settle without an offer of a job, in Bronson there was no possibility that the lawyer may have thought he was authorized to accept the settlement agreement as the lawyer testified that he accepted the proffered settlement even though the client had \"made it clear to [the attorney] that he would not accept the offer of settlement\u201d and had stopped communicating with the lawyer. 404 A.2d at 961.\\n\\n\\n. When the court referred the matter to the magistrate for settlement purposes, it ordered the District to \u201chave present at all settlement meetings ... an individual with full settlement authority.\u201d As the majority notes, the court\\'s order did not contain a similar instruction addressed to Ms. Makins. That is more likely a reflection of the court\u2019s experience with the manner in which bureaucratic institutions such as governments and corporations operate, than an indication that it expected to set up a lopsided negotiation where only one side of the litigation would be in a position to reach a final settlement. Rather, the court most likely did not feel a need to order that Ms. Makins\u2019s lawyer be fully authorized to settle her case because it assumed that would be the case.\\n\\n\\n.As the majority notes, the court in Ashley stated that an attorney cannot bind a client to a settlement without \"specific authority.\u201d This statement is unsupported by any citation. The majority also attempts to distinguish Ashley on the basis that the client was present in court when counsel agreed to the terms of the settlement. Although it is possible \u2014 though by no means certain \u2014 to glean that fact from the court\u2019s opinion, it is irrelevant to the court\u2019s analysis which, as mentioned in the text, relied on counsel\\'s \"categorical, unambiguous, unequivocal\u201d statements in court. There is no suggestion that counsel\u2019s representations in the case before us were any less definitive.\\n\\n\\n. Review of the District Court\u2019s finding is properly the function of our federal counterpart, applying District of Columbia law as set out in our answer to the certified question.\\n\\n\\n. Where the lawyer does not have apparent authority and therefore does not bind the client, the lawyer may be subject to liability to a third person who relied on the lawyer\u2019s representations in good faith based on implied warranty of actual authority or misrepresentation.

We affirm the trial court\\'s decision to grant summary judgment on Barekman\\'s sexual harassment claim.

Standard of Review\\nIn determining whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment, we employ a de novo standard of review. City of Springfield v. Gee, 149 S.W.3d 609, 612 (Mo.App.2004). Consequently, we do not defer to the trial court\\'s decision to grant summary judgment. Murphy v. Jackson Nat\\'l Life Ins. Co., 83 S.W.3d 663, 665 (Mo.App.2002). Instead, we use the same criteria the trial court should have employed in initially deciding whether to grant the City\\'s motion. Stormer v. Richfield Hospitality Services, Inc., 60 S.W.3d 10, 12 (Mo.App.2001). We view the record in the light most favorable to the party against whom judgment was entered, and we accord that party the benefit of all inferences which may reasonably be drawn from the record.

A defending party \"may establish a right to summary judgment by showing: (1) facts negating any one of the claimant\\'s elements; (2) that the party opposing the motion has presented insufficient evidence to allow the finding of the existence of any one of the claimant\\'s elements; or (3) that there is no genuine dispute as to the existence of each of the facts necessary to support a properly pleaded affirmative defense.\" Ameristar Jet Charter, Inc. v. Dodson Intern. Parts, Inc., 155 S.W.3d 50, 58-59 (Mo. banc 2005).\\n\\nII. Factual and Procedural Background\\nBarekman began working for the City as a police officer in June 1995. At that time, Theresa Sweet (Sweet) was a full-time patrol officer. From June 1995 through early 1999, Sweet was one of Barekman\\'s *678 superiors. In an affidavit and a deposition, Barekman stated that he was subjected to sexual harassment by Sweet because she told jokes about male and female genitalia, talked about having to urinate, described her underwear, discussed her sex life and talked about various sexual acts in Barekman\\'s presence. Nearly all of the other male and female police officers and other department employees engaged in such behavior. Members of both sexes made improper statements and used sexually explicit language in Barekman\\'s presence. The \"big joke in the entire department\" was to engage in such conduct to see how quickly Barekman would become embarrassed and walk away. He was \"constantly made the butt of everyone\\'s crude jokes.\"\\nAt some point, Barekman transferred to the Investigative Division. After the transfer, he requested that Sweet be assigned to that department. In May 2001, Barekman became Sweet\\'s supervisor. After becoming Barekman\\'s subordinate, Sweet kissed him on the cheek and gave him cards signed \"Love\" and \"Love Ya.\" Barekman did not report the behavior or \"write up\" Sweet for her actions, although he was required to do so pursuant to City\\'s sexual harassment policy. He gave Sweet good evaluations on her work performance. He gave gifts to Sweet, rubbed her neck and gave her a birthday card in November 2001 signed, \"Love, Rodney.\"\\nIn December of 2001, Sweet filed a complaint against Barekman. The complaint alleged that: (1) he was creating a hostile work environment; (2) he had sexually harassed Sweet; and (3) he was conducting outside business activities at work while on duty in violation of City policies. Barekman discussed Sweet\\'s complaint with the acting Chief of Police Darrell Crick (Crick). According to Barekman, Crick said the complaint was \"[n]o big deal. You will just get a slap on the hands, and be told not to do that anymore.\" Crick asked Barekman to submit a response by January 16, 2002. In Barekman\\'s response, he denied Sweet\\'s allegations. He also complained that he had been subjected to repeated sexual harassment at work by Sweet. He had not reported it to the City earlier because he did not believe his complaint would be taken seriously since he was a male.\\nOn February 8, 2002, the City sent a letter to Barekman requesting that he resign immediately or be fired. The City gave two reasons for this demand: (1) recent comments made by Barekman led the City to believe that he would \"continue to engage in hostile, retaliatory behavior\" which undermined the City; and (2) an internal investigation had confirmed multiple instances in which Barekman used City property to conduct private business. The letter made it clear that Barekman\\'s employment by the City was over:\\nYour behavior as a City employee and supervisor is not acceptable. Therefore, I am requesting your letter of resignation immediately. If I do not receive your signed letter of resignation by 5:00 p.m., Monday, February 11, 2002, you will be terminated at that time.\\nOn February 11, 2002, Barekman resigned under protest. He chose to resign for two reasons. First, his resignation allowed him to get paid for his accrued and unused vacation and comp time. Second, if he had been fired, the Missouri Department of Public Safety could have filed an action to revoke his peace officer\\'s license. Without that license, Barekman could not work in law enforcement.\\nIn March 2002, Barekman filed a verified complaint with the Missouri Human Rights Commission. The complaint stated that: (1) he had been sexually harassed by Sweet; (2) he reported her conduct to the *679 City; (3) and he was forced to resign. The complaint then stated:\\nThe conduct of the [City] was retaliatory on its part for raising the sexual harassment and hostile work environment created by Officer Sweet. I was told by the City Administrator, Dean Thompson, that my complaint against Officer Sweet was being viewed as \"sour grapes\" and nothing had been done nor would be done about my complaint.\\nIn December 2002, Barekman sued the City. The petition alleged that: (1) Barekman was exposed to a sexually hostile work environment because Sweet and other police officers used sexually-oriented and suggestive language in front of Barekman, which embarrassed him; and (2) he had been constructively discharged in retaliation for complaining about Sweet\\'s behavior. In May 2005, the City filed a motion for summary judgment. After Barekman filed his response and the parties submitted suggestions, the trial court held a hearing on the motion. In June 2006, the City was granted summary judgment. This appeal followed.\\n\\nIII. Discussion and Decision\\nIn Barekman\\'s first point, he challenges the trial court\\'s decision to grant summary judgment on his sexual harassment claim. The Missouri Human Rights Act (MHRA) prohibits an employer from discriminating against any individual \"with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\\'s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry, age or disability[.]\" \u00a7 213.055.1(1)(a). When reviewing a claim under the MHRA, \"appellate courts are guided by both Missouri law and federal employment discrimination caselaw that is consistent with Missouri law.\" Daugherty v. City of Maryland Heights, 231 S.W.3d 814, ___ (Mo. banc, 2007).\\nSexual harassment creates a hostile work environment when sexual conduct either creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment or has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\\'s work performance. Mason v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 91 S.W.3d 738, 742 (Mo.App.2002). \"An employer is liable for the sexual harassment of one co-worker by another if the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt and effective remedial action.\" Id. To prevail on a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim, Barekman had to prove the following ultimate facts: (1) he is a member of a protected group; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) his gender was a contributing factor in the harassment; (4) a term, condition, or privilege of his employment was affected by the harassment; and (5) the City knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take appropriate action. Daugherty, 231 S.W.3d at ___4; MAI 31.24; see Cooper v. Albacore Holdings, Inc., 204 S.W.3d 238, 244 (Mo.App. 2006); Mason, 91 S.W.3d at 742.[3] If Barekman failed to present sufficient evidence to allow an affirmative finding to be made on any one of the foregoing elements, the City was entitled to summary *680 judgment on Barekman\\'s hostile work environment claim. See Ameristar Jet Charter, Inc. v. Dodson Intern. Parts, Inc., 155 S.W.3d 50, 58-59 (Mo. banc 2005). The City argues that Barekman failed to prove the third element of this claim. This issue is dispositive of the first point on appeal.\\nAs noted above, \u00a7 213.055.1(1)(a) prohibits an employer from discriminating \"against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\\'s . . . sex. . . .\" In Barekman\\'s brief, he argues that the third element of his claim was satisfied because \"the conduct was sexual in nature, content, meaning and content of language. It is clear and beyond question but that [sic] Plaintiff was harassed because of his sensitivities to conduct, language, examples, and stories that were of an explicit, perverted and unwelcome sexual nature\" in the workplace. As we apprehend the argument, Barekman contends that evidence of his exposure to sexual comments and discussions in the workplace is sufficient to prove he was the victim of gender discrimination. He cites no authority to support this interpretation of the statute.[4]\\nLike the MHRA, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 also prohibits an employer from discriminating \"against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\\'s . . . sex. . . .\" 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)(West 2003). In Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998), the United States Supreme Court noted that Title VII is only directed at discrimination because of sex and does not prohibit all verbal or physical harassment in the workplace. Id. at 80, 118 S. Ct. 998. \"We have never held that workplace harassment, even harassment between men and women, is automatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content or connotations.\" Id. Instead, a textual analysis of Title VII indicates that the critical issue is whether members of one gender are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other gender are not exposed. Id. Thus, in order to prevail on this type of claim, a plaintiff always must prove that the conduct at issue constituted gender discrimination, and not just that the conduct was \"tinged with offensive sexual connotations.\" Id. at 81, 118 S. Ct. 998. In Schoffstall v. Henderson, 223 F.3d 818 (8th Cir.2000), the district court granted summary judgment on the plaintiff\\'s hostile work environment sexual harassment claim. The facts showed that the alleged harasser engaged in the same type of conduct with both genders and while both male and female employees were present. Applying the Oncale test, the Eighth Circuit held that summary judgment was properly granted because the plaintiff failed to prove that members of one sex were exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex were not exposed. Id. at 826-27.\\nCiting Oncale and Schoffstall, the City argues that Barekman failed to satisfy the third element of his hostile work environment claim. This Court agrees. Viewed in a light most favorable to Barekman, the undisputed facts before *681 the trial court failed to establish that male officers were exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which female employees were not exposed. According to the descriptions of events in Barekman\\'s affidavit and deposition testimony, both male and female employees of the City police department were exposed to, and participated in, the conduct about which Barekman complains. \"The use of foul language in front of both men and women is not discrimination based on sex.\" Hocevar v. Purdue Frederick Co., 223 F.3d 721, 737 (8 th Cir.2000). The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the facts is that Barekman was the butt of other employees\\' jokes because he was sensitive to, and easily embarrassed by, such behavior. In short, Barekman has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether his gender was a contributing factor in his harassment. Daugherty v. The City of Maryland Heights, 231 S.W.3d 814, ____ (Mo. banc, 2007); Lowry v. Powerscreen USB, Inc., 72 F. Supp. 2d 1061, 1070 (E.D.Mo.1999) (requiring that there be a causal nexus between the harassment and the plaintiff\\'s gender). While the conduct of Barekman\\'s fellow employees may have been boorish, vulgar and inappropriate, it does not constitute gender discrimination under the MHRA. See Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80-81, 118 S. Ct. 998; McCown v. St. John\\'s Health System, 349 F.3d 540, 543-44 (8 th Cir. 2003); Schoffstall, 223 F.3d at 826-27. Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the City on Barekman\\'s hostile work environment sexual harassment claim. Point I is denied.\\nIn Barekman\\'s second point on appeal, he contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the retaliatory discharge claim. This Court agrees. Viewed in a light most favorable to Barekman, his evidentiary submissions were sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact that precluded the entry of summary judgment on this claim.\\nSweet\\'s sexual harassment complaint against Barekman was filed in December 2001. Barekman presented evidence that, initially, the complaint was not treated as a serious matter. According to Barekman, the acting Chief of Police said the complaint was \"[n]o big deal. You will just get a slap on the hands, and be told not to do that anymore.\" Barekman was told to file a response by January 16, 2002. When he responded, however, he did more than just deny the accusations against him. He also complained that he had been the victim of long-term sexual harassment by Sweet that no one would take seriously because he was male. Thereafter, Barekman said he was told by the City administrator that nothing had been done or would be done about his complaint. Within three weeks, the City told Barekman to resign immediately or be fired. In Barekman\\'s affidavit and deposition testimony, he stated that he was exposed to a sexually hostile work environment by Sweet and other police officers and that he had been constructively discharged in retaliation for complaining to the City about Sweet\\'s behavior.\\nSexual harassment creating a hostile work environment is a practice prohibited by Chapter 213. See, e.g., Cooper v. Albacore Holdings, Inc., 204 S.W.3d 238, 244 (Mo.App.2006); Mason v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 91 S.W.3d 738, 742 (Mo.App. 2002). The MHRA makes it an unlawful discriminatory practice \"[t]o retaliate or discriminate in any manner against any other person because such person has opposed any practice prohibited by this chapter. . . .\" \u00a7 213.070(2). Under the facts presented here, Barekman can establish a prima facie case of retaliation pursuant to this section by proving that: (1) he complained about being the victim of a sexually hostile work environment to the City; *682 and (2) as a direct result, he suffered damages due to an act of reprisal by his employer. See Keeney v. Hereford Concrete Products, Inc., 911 S.W.2d 622, 625-26 (Mo. banc 1995). With respect to the latter element, Barekman must prove that the City purposely committed the act of reprisal because of Barekman\\'s complaint. See id.\\nBarekman presented sufficient evidence, if believed by the trier of fact, to prove the following facts: (1) he complained to the City about being sexually harassed by Sweet at work; (2) the City refused to investigate the complaint; and (3) shortly after making the complaint, he was constructively discharged by the City.[5] The pivotal question here is the purpose underlying the City\\'s demand that Barekman immediately resign or be fired. Keeney, 911 S.W.2d at 626. The City argues that it did so because of Barekman\\'s response to Sweet\\'s complaint against him and his violation of various City policies dealing with the conduct of private business at work. In Barekman\\'s evidentiary submissions, however, he denied that he engaged in any retaliatory behavior. He also stated that any private business he did on City property was done with the express consent of the Chief of Police and that he stopped certain activities after being told to do so by the Chief. Furthermore, the closeness in time between the Barekman\\'s complaint and the City\\'s demand for his resignation or firing supports an inference of retaliatory motive. See, e.g., Buettner v. Arch Coal Sales Co., Inc., 216 F.3d 707, 715-16 (8 th Cir.2000); Rath v. Selection Research, Inc., 978 F.2d 1087, 1090 (8th Cir.1992). Summary judgment is particularly inappropriate when the underlying issue is one of state of mind, motivation, intent or some other subjective fact. Hearod v. Baggs, 169 S.W.3d 198, 205 (Mo.App.2005); Ganaway v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co., 795 S.W.2d 554, 562 (Mo. App.1990). Finally, \"[s]ummary judgment should seldom be used in employment discrimination cases, because such cases are inherently fact-based and often depend on inferences rather than on direct evidence. Summary judgment should not be granted unless evidence could not support any reasonable inference for the non-movant.\" Daugherty v. City of Maryland Heights, 231 S.W.3d 814, ___ (Mo. banc, 2007).\\nA genuine issue of material fact exists when the record shows two plausible, but contradictory, accounts of the essential facts. See ITT Commercial Finance Corp. v. Mid-Am. Marine Supply Corp., 854 S.W.2d 371, 376 (Mo. banc 1993). The record here establishes a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City\\'s purpose or intent in demanding Barekman\\'s immediate resignation or termination was to retaliate against him for complaining about sexual harassment in the workplace. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on Barekman\\'s retaliatory discharge claim. Point II is granted.\\nThe trial court\\'s judgment on the sexual harassment claim is affirmed. The trial court\\'s judgment on the retaliatory discharge claim is reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion on the latter claim.\\nGARRISON, J, and BARNEY, J., concur.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  All reference to statutes are to RSMo (2000) unless otherwise specified.\\n[2]  All references to rules are to Missouri Court Rules (2007).\\n[3]  Mason and Cooper state that the third element of this type of claim is \"the harassment was based upon sex[.]\" In Daugherty, our Supreme Court held that, in a claim involving a violation of \u00a7 213.055, a plaintiff is not required to prove \"that discrimination was a substantial or determining factor in an employment decision; if consideration of age, disability, or other protected characteristics contributed to the unfair treatment, that is sufficient.\" Daugherty, at \\x97. Therefore, we have revised the third element of the claim to be consistent with Daugherty.\\n[4]  \"An appellant has an obligation to cite appropriate and available precedent if he expects to prevail, and, if no authority is available to cite, he should explain the reason for the absence of citations.\" Brown v. Ameristar Casino Kansas City, Inc., 211 S.W.3d 145, 148 (Mo.App.2007).\\n[5]  The City\\'s demand that Barekman immediately resign or be fired could amount to a constructive discharge by the City.

Months later, Kilpatrick began issuing written\\nreprimands to Gibson for a panoply of alleged deficiencies. Gibson subsequently\\nfiled a lawsuit alleging unconstitutional retaliation as well as state tort law\\nclaims. Kilpatrick moved for summary judgment, raising the defense of qualified\\nimmunity and arguing that the state tort law claims were barred because Gibson\\nfailed to comply with state notice requirements. The district court denied the\\n\\x0c     Case: 12-60905       Document: 00512446675         Page: 2     Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       No. 12-60905\\n\\nmotion with respect to qualified immunity, but granted it with respect to the\\nstate tort claims. Kilpatrick now brings this interlocutory appeal of the district\\ncourt\u2019s order denying qualified immunity, and Gibson cross-appeals the district\\ncourt\u2019s dismissal of one of his tort claims. Kilpatrick moves to dismiss the cross-\\nappeal for lack of jurisdiction. We hold that Kilpatrick is entitled to qualified\\nimmunity and reverse the district court\u2019s order to the extent that it denied\\nqualified immunity. Additionally, because we lack jurisdiction to hear Gibson\u2019s\\ncross-appeal, we grant Kilpatrick\u2019s motion to dismiss the cross-appeal.\\n                    I. Factual and Procedural Background\\n       In 2006, Anthony Gibson applied to be Chief of Police in Drew, Mississippi.\\nMayor Jeffrey Kilpatrick opposed Gibson\u2019s application and supported another\\ncandidate.     The city\u2019s Board of Aldermen (\u201cBoard\u201d) rejected Kilpatrick\u2019s\\nrecommendation and hired Gibson in August 2006. As Chief of Police, Gibson\\nreported directly to Kilpatrick and the Board.\\n       Sometime within the first four months of Gibson\u2019s employment, a\\nsubordinate at the police department informed Gibson that Kilpatrick was\\nmisusing the city gasoline card to fuel his vehicle for personal trips. Gibson\\nconfidentially reported his suspicions to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\\n(\u201cFBI\u201d), Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d),1 Mississippi Office of the State\\nAuditor (\u201cOSA\u201d), and Mississippi Attorney General\u2019s Office. His reports to the\\nFBI and DEA were through contacts with whom he had worked in an official\\ncapacity on prior occasions. The OSA initiated an investigation, and Gibson\\nworked with Investigator Karen Swain to assist in the OSA\u2019s efforts. Because\\nKilpatrick had to come to the police department to obtain the gasoline card,\\nGibson was able to monitor Kilpatrick\u2019s activities. Gibson instructed two police\\n\\n\\n       1\\n         Gibson heard rumors that Kilpatrick might be involved in illicit drugs; however, this\\nallegation was never investigated or substantiated. It did prompt his decision to contact at\\nleast the DEA.\\n\\n                                              2\\n\\x0c     Case: 12-60905       Document: 00512446675          Page: 3     Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       No. 12-60905\\n\\ndispatchers to make log entries every time Kilpatrick asked to use the card, and\\nhe ordered a police officer to observe Kilpatrick following receipt of the card.\\nGibson and Swain also directed the city clerk to monitor receipts from Drew\u2019s\\ngasoline provider to compare them with the information recorded in the log. In\\nSeptember 2008, the investigation concluded, finding that Kilpatrick had\\nmisused the city gasoline card, and the OSA ordered Kilpatrick to repay\\napproximately $3,000 to the City of Drew for his unauthorized use of the card.\\n       Approximately nine months after the conclusion of the investigation,\\nKilpatrick began entering written reprimands into Gibson\u2019s personnel file. The\\nfirst reprimand came on June 8, 2009, and the reprimands continued for over\\ntwo years.2 In addition to the reprimands, Kilpatrick recommended Gibson\u2019s\\ntermination to the Board on several occasions, including for insubordination,\\nlack of visibility in the community, and failure to work an adequate number of\\nhours.\\n       On December 1, 2010, Gibson brought this action in federal court against\\nKilpatrick in his individual capacity, alleging violations of his First Amendment\\nright to free expression under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and malicious interference with\\nemployment and intentional infliction of emotional distress under Mississippi\\nlaw. Less than a year later, on October 5, 2011, the Board voted to terminate\\nGibson\u2019s employment. Gibson subsequently amended his complaint to add the\\nCity of Drew as a defendant, alleging that the city violated his First Amendment\\nrights in retaliation for his filing suit against Kilpatrick.\\n\\n\\n\\n       2\\n         The record contains nine different reprimands of Gibson from Kilpatrick over this\\nperiod for, inter alia, Gibson\u2019s tardiness to a meeting because he was driving to the emergency\\nroom for medical care; assisting a neighboring police department with a domestic violence\\nstand-off without first obtaining prior approval from the Board; holding a staff meeting that\\ncaused the city to incur overtime payments; and allowing citizens to play basketball in the new\\ncommunity center after the Board had approved the center\u2019s use for a luncheon for city\\nemployees.\\n\\n                                              3\\n\\x0c     Case: 12-60905      Document: 00512446675        Page: 4    Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     No. 12-60905\\n\\n       Kilpatrick and the City of Drew jointly moved for summary judgment on\\nGibson\u2019s First Amendment and state law claims.3 Kilpatrick asserted that he\\nwas entitled to qualified immunity as to the First Amendment claim because\\nGibson\u2019s speech was not constitutionally protected nor were Kilpatrick\u2019s actions\\nobjectively unreasonable. As for the state law claims, Kilpatrick and the City of\\nDrew argued that Gibson failed to file a notice of claim in compliance with the\\nMississippi Tort Claims Act (\u201cMTCA\u201d), so the claims were barred. See Miss.\\nCode Ann. \u00a7 11-46-11 (2013). The court \u201creserved judgment\u201d as to whether\\nKilpatrick had violated Gibson\u2019s constitutional rights and whether Kilpatrick\\nwas entitled to qualified immunity; however, it entered judgment in the\\ndefendants\u2019 favor with respect to the state law tort claims. Kilpatrick moved for\\nreconsideration of his qualified immunity defense, and the court held that\\nKilpatrick was not entitled to qualified immunity because Gibson\u2019s speech was\\nprotected under the First Amendment and the right was clearly established.\\n      Kilpatrick timely appealed the district court\u2019s summary judgment and\\nreconsideration orders.       Gibson timely cross-appealed the district court\u2019s\\ndismissal of his state law tort claim for malicious interference with employment.\\nKilpatrick moved to dismiss the cross-appeal for lack of jurisdiction, and the\\ncourt ordered that motion to be carried with the case.\\n                              II. Qualified Immunity\\nA. Standard of Review\\n      Typically, a party may not immediately appeal a district court\u2019s decision\\nto deny summary judgment, but the denial of a motion for summary judgment\\nbased on qualified immunity is a collateral order capable of immediate review.\\nBrown v. Strain, 663 F.3d 245, 248 (5th Cir. 2011). This court has jurisdiction\\n\\n\\n      3\\n          The district court denied summary judgment as to both Kilpatrick and the City of\\nDrew. Since the City of Drew is not party to this appeal, we do not address the municipal\\nliability claim.\\n\\n                                            4\\n\\x0c    Case: 12-60905     Document: 00512446675      Page: 5    Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  No. 12-60905\\n\\nover such an order only \u201cto the extent that the district court\u2019s order turns on an\\nissue of law.\u201d Kovacic v. Villarreal, 628 F.3d 209, 211 (5th Cir. 2010). We may\\nnot review a district court\u2019s decision to deny qualified immunity based on\\nevidentiary sufficiency on an interlocutory appeal, because such a determination\\nis not considered a \u201cfinal decision.\u201d Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 313 (1995);\\nGobert v. Caldwell, 463 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir. 2006). This court \u201cconsider[s]\\nonly whether the district court erred in assessing the legal significance of the\\nconduct that the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of\\nsummary judgment.\u201d Kinney v. Weaver, 367 F.3d 337, 348 (5th Cir. 2004) (en\\nbanc).   \u201cWhere factual disputes exist in an interlocutory appeal asserting\\nqualified immunity, we accept the plaintiffs\u2019 version of the facts as true.\u201d Id. \u201cIn\\nreviewing the district court\u2019s conclusions concerning the legal consequences\u2014the\\nmateriality\u2014of the facts, our review is of course de novo.\u201d Id. at 349.\\nB. Discussion\\n      To rebut a defendant\u2019s qualified immunity defense, the plaintiff must\\nshow: \u201c(1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2)\\nthat the right was \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time of the challenged conduct.\u201d\\nAshcroft v. Al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2080 (2011) (citation omitted). A court may\\nconsider either prong of the qualified immunity analysis first. Pearson v.\\nCallahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009). We begin by addressing the first prong\u2014\\nwhether Kilpatrick\u2019s reprimands violated Gibson\u2019s First Amendment right to\\nfree expression.\\n      The Supreme Court has long held that government employees are not\\nstripped of their right to freedom of expression by virtue of their employment.\\nConnick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 142 (1983); Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S.\\n563, 568 (1968). This right is not absolute, though, and we utilize a four-pronged\\ntest to determine whether the speech of a public employee is entitled to\\nconstitutional protection. See Juarez v. Aguilar, 666 F.3d 325, 332 (5th Cir.\\n\\n                                         5\\n\\x0c     Case: 12-60905        Document: 00512446675          Page: 6     Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        No. 12-60905\\n\\n2011). A plaintiff must establish that: (1) he suffered an adverse employment\\ndecision; (2) his speech involved a matter of public concern; (3) his interest in\\nspeaking outweighed the governmental defendant\u2019s interest in promoting\\nefficiency; and (4) the protected speech motivated the defendant\u2019s conduct. Id.\\n(citations omitted).        In 2006, the Supreme Court added what we have\\ncharacterized as a \u201cthreshold layer\u201d to the second prong of the retaliation test.\\nSee Davis v. McKinney, 518 F.3d 304, 312 (5th Cir. 2008) (describing Garcetti v.\\nCeballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006)). Under this prong, \u201cwhen public employees make\\nstatements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as\\ncitizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate\\ntheir communications from employer discipline.\u201d Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 421.\\nWhile the court must consider factual circumstances to determine whether\\nspeech is official, the determination is still a question of law. Charles v. Grief,\\n522 F.3d 508, 513 n.17 (5th Cir. 2008). Functionally, this threshold layer has\\ntransformed our test, inserting an additional prong at which we consider\\nwhether the speech was pursuant to the employee\u2019s duties or as a citizen.\\n       In this case, our analysis begins and ends at this new prong.4 Because\\n\\n\\n\\n       4\\n          Kilpatrick also argues that a reprimand is not an adverse employment action under\\nthe first prong. We assume without deciding that a reprimand is an adverse employment\\naction for the purposes of a \u00a7 1983 claim. While the Supreme Court has clarified that, under\\nTitle VII, a plaintiff must prove that a reasonable employee would have found the alleged\\nadverse employment action \u201cmaterially adverse,\u201d Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White,\\n548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006), this court has not yet decided whether the Burlington standard for\\nadverse employment actions also applies to First Amendment retaliation cases, see DePree v.\\nSaunders, 588 F.3d 282, 288 (5th Cir. 2009) (explaining that this circuit has not \u201cformally\\napplied Burlington to First Amendment retaliation claims\u201d). As for the third prong, Kilpatrick\\ndid not challenge that in the district court, but the district court conducted a balancing of the\\nparties\u2019 interests and concluded that they favored Gibson. Kilpatrick does not raise this prong\\nin his appeal. Regarding the fourth prong, Kilpatrick asserts that there are insufficient facts\\nin the record to show that the speech motivated his conduct. We lack jurisdiction to consider\\nKilpatrick\u2019s arguments regarding the fourth prong, since issues regarding the sufficiency of\\nevidence are factual issues that may not be considered in an interlocutory appeal. See Gobert,\\n463 F.3d at 344.\\n\\n                                               6\\n\\x0c     Case: 12-60905      Document: 00512446675         Page: 7     Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      No. 12-60905\\n\\nGibson\u2019s report to law enforcement agencies was official speech, we must\\nreverse.\\n       We turn first to the source of this new prong\u2014Garcetti. In Garcetti, a\\ndeputy district attorney reviewed an affidavit supporting a search warrant and\\nconcluded that the affidavit contained misrepresentations. See 547 U.S. at\\n413\u201314, 421. The attorney reported his concerns to his supervisors and provided\\none with a memorandum. Id. at 414. The supervisors held a meeting on the\\nmatter, but they decided to proceed with the prosecution despite the attorney\u2019s\\nconcerns. Id. The defense moved to challenge the warrant and called the\\nattorney to testify at the hearing regarding his observations. Id. at 414\u201315. The\\nattorney complied, allegedly prompting retaliation from his supervisors. Id.\\n       The Supreme Court concluded that the First Amendment did not shield\\nthe attorney\u2019s speech from discipline. The Court began its analysis by clarifying\\nwhich facts were not dispositive. The fact that the attorney \u201cexpressed his views\\ninside his office, rather than publicly,\u201d did not render his speech unprotected,\\nsince \u201c[m]any citizens do much of their talking inside their respective\\nworkplaces.\u201d Id. at 420. Likewise, the fact that the \u201cmemo concerned the\\nsubject matter of [the attorney\u2019s] employment . . . is nondispositive. The First\\nAmendment protects some expressions related to the speaker\u2019s job.\u201d Id. at 421\\n(citations omitted).     Ultimately, \u201cthe controlling factor . . . [was] that his\\nexpressions were made pursuant to his duties as calendar deputy.\u201d Id. As a\\ncalendar deputy, it was his duty to advise his supervisors about how to proceed\\nwith prosecutions, and the investigation of charges and preparation of\\nmemoranda were part of his \u201cdaily professional activities.\u201d5 Id. at 421\u201322.\\n       While Garcetti clearly added an additional inquiry into our freedom of\\n\\n\\n       5\\n        The Supreme Court was not required to review findings of fact as to the scope of the\\nattorney\u2019s professional duties since it was undisputed that the attorney produced the\\nmemorandum pursuant to his duties as a prosecutor. Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 421.\\n\\n                                             7\\n\\x0c    Case: 12-60905      Document: 00512446675       Page: 8    Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    No. 12-60905\\n\\nexpression analysis, the Court \u201cdid not explicate what it means to speak\\npursuant to one\u2019s official duties, although we do know that a formal job\\ndescription is not dispositive . . . [,] nor is speaking on the subject matter of one\u2019s\\nemployment.\u201d Williams v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 480 F.3d 689, 692 (5th Cir.\\n2007) (per curiam) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (hereinafter\\n\u201cWilliams\u201d). The Supreme Court acknowledged that Garcetti did not \u201carticulate\\na comprehensive framework for defining the scope of an employee\u2019s duties in\\ncases where there is room for serious debate,\u201d thus signaling that lower courts\\nmust flesh out the distinction between official and citizen speech. 547 U.S. at\\n424. We have since undertaken this task.\\n      In Williams, we considered whether a memorandum sent by a school\\nathletic director to a school principal about the misuse of athletic funds was\\nofficial speech. 480 F.3d at 689\u201394. It was undisputed that the director was not\\nrequired to write memoranda as part of his regular job duties, but we\\nnonetheless held that his speech was made pursuant to his official duties. Id.\\nat 693. We reasoned that \u201c[a]ctivities undertaken in the course of performing\\none\u2019s job are activities pursuant to official duties.\u201d Id. The memorandum\\nconcerned matters immediately within his purview as the athletic director\u2014the\\nuse of funds for the school athletic teams and the related accounting procedures.\\nThus, the speech was made as part of his official duties. Id. at 694.\\n      A year later, in Davis, we held that an information systems auditor spoke\\npursuant to her official duties and as a citizen when she sent a complaint letter\\nto her supervisors and to the Chancellor of the University of Texas. 518 F.3d at\\n307\u201316.    Davis worked for the university, and she conducted an audit of\\nuniversity computers and discovered pornography.              Id. at 307\u201308.    Davis\\napproached various administrators to address the issue, but she considered their\\nresponse to be inadequate. Id. at 308\u201309. She sent a complaint letter to her\\nimmediate supervisors and to the Chancellor, in which she noted that she had\\n\\n                                          8\\n\\x0c    Case: 12-60905     Document: 00512446675       Page: 9   Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   No. 12-60905\\n\\nalso filed complaints with the FBI regarding possible child pornography and the\\nEEOC about workplace discrimination.            Id. at 309, 314.     Since Davis\u2019s\\ncomplaints to the FBI and EEOC were clearly made outside of the chain of\\ncommand, and since her duties as an auditor did not require that she\\ncommunicate with law enforcement, we held that the complaints constituted\\ncitizen speech. Id. at 316.\\n      Deciding whether the speech in the letter was made pursuant to Davis\u2019s\\nofficial duties required more careful deliberation since the letter discussed\\nmultiple topics and had multiple recipients.         Id. at 314.    We considered\\nadditional factors, including the relationship between the speech and the\\nemployee\u2019s job, whether the speech was made within the employee\u2019s chain of\\ncommand, and whether the speech stemmed from special knowledge the\\nemployee gained as a result of the employee\u2019s position. Id. A portion of Davis\u2019s\\nletter discussed the \u201cinadequate response to her investigation of employees\\naccessing pornography,\u201d which we held amounted to official speech since it\\ninvolved work that she had performed as part of her duties. Id. at 315\u201316.\\nHowever, the remainder of the letter addressed university-wide discrimination,\\nfavoritism, and the compensation of executives, which constituted citizen speech\\nsince it did not concern Davis\u2019s duties as an auditor. Id. at 316.\\n      In addition to our own precedent, Kilpatrick urges us to adopt the\\nreasoning of the Ninth Circuit in Huppert v. City of Pittsburg, 574 F.3d 696 (9th\\nCir. 2009), and apply it to Gibson\u2019s speech. Huppert relied on a 1939 California\\nappellate court decision to conclude, as a matter of law, that a police officer acted\\npursuant to his official duties in cooperating with the FBI and testifying before\\na grand jury. Id. at 706\u201310 (relying on Christal v. Police Comm\u2019n of City and\\nCnty. of S.F., 92 P.2d 416 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1939)). Kilpatrick advocates for\\nthis analysis and argues that we may rely on Mississippi\u2019s statutory definition\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         9\\n\\x0c    Case: 12-60905        Document: 00512446675         Page: 10     Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       No. 12-60905\\n\\nof a law enforcement officer to define Gibson\u2019s official duties as the Chief of\\nPolice.6\\n       In a recent en banc decision, the Ninth Circuit overruled Huppert \u201cto the\\nextent that it improperly relied on a generic job description and failed to conduct\\nthe \u2018practical,\u2019 fact-specific inquiry required by Garcetti.\u201d Dahlia v. Rodriguez,\\n\u2014 F.3d \u2014, 2013 WL 4437594, at *7 (9th Cir. Aug. 21, 2013) (en banc). Garcetti\\nclearly warned against the use of a written job description to define an\\nemployee\u2019s duties, explaining that\\n       Formal job descriptions often bear little resemblance to the duties\\n       an employee actually is expected to perform, and the listing of a\\n       given task in an employee\u2019s written job description is neither\\n       necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that conducting the task is\\n       within the scope of the employee\u2019s professional duties for First\\n       Amendment purposes.\\nGarcetti, 547 U.S. at 424\u201325. The Court was concerned that the use of a written\\njob description might lead to \u201cemployers . . . [restricting] employees\u2019 rights by\\ncreating excessively broad job descriptions.\u201d Id. at 424. In Dahlia, the Ninth\\nCircuit held that Huppert\u2019s reliance on \u201ca broad court-created job description\\napplicable to every member of a profession\u201d was equally as problematic as\\nrelying on an employer-created job description. 2013 WL 4437594, at *7.\\n       Yet, Huppert\u2019s analysis raises a pertinent question\u2014to what extent should\\na court consider statutory duties of a police officer in identifying the scope of his\\nor her official duties? Garcetti was concerned with courts limiting their analysis\\nto the written description of an occupation, divorced from the actual function of\\nthe employee. We have since interpreted Garcetti\u2019s language as proscribing our\\nexclusive reliance on an employer\u2019s written description of duties when\\n\\n       6\\n        Mississippi law defines a law enforcement officer, which Gibson undoubtedly was, as\\n\u201cany person . . . whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime, the\\napprehension of criminals[,] and the enforcement of the criminal and traffic laws of this state\\nand\/or the ordinances of any political subdivision thereof.\u201d Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 45-6-3(c).\\n\\n\\n                                              10\\n\\x0c   Case: 12-60905        Document: 00512446675    Page: 11   Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   No. 12-60905\\n\\nevaluating the merits of a First Amendment retaliation claim. See Williams v.\\nRiley, 275 F. App\u2019x 385, 389 (5th Cir. 2008) (unpublished) (per curiam)\\n(hereinafter \u201cRiley\u201d).     In Riley, jailers at a sheriff\u2019s office reported their\\nsupervisor\u2019s abuse of an inmate. Id. at 387. The only facts in the record\\nconcerning the jailers\u2019 duty to report incidents of force came from a policy\\nmanual; outside of the manual, the job duties of the jailers were \u201cscarcely\\nmentioned.\u201d Id. at 389. We could have \u201cpresumed that an employee\u2019s official job\\nduties at a reasonable sheriff\u2019s department would include reporting crimes\\nperpetrated at work by department members,\u201d but the record did not actually\\ninclude such facts, so we remanded the case for further proceedings. Id. at\\n389\u201390.\\n      Riley does not completely preclude the use of written job descriptions in\\na First Amendment inquiry. In Davis, we expressly considered a university\\nmemorandum that outlined the reporting procedures to be used by auditors in\\norder to understand Davis\u2019s duty to report as well as the chain of command. 518\\nF.3d at 316. Unlike Riley, the record contained additional facts concerning the\\nduties of auditors, so our analysis was not limited to the policy memorandum.\\nThe memorandum was important to our determination that some of the speech\\nin Davis\u2019s letter to the Chancellor was official, thus showing that there is a\\nproper place for the use of written descriptions of duties in a First Amendment\\nretaliation analysis. Id.\\n      We decline to rely exclusively on a statutory description of a generic law\\nenforcement officer to determine the scope of a specific police officer\u2019s official\\nduties. However, we do not exclude written descriptions of duties or statutory\\ndefinitions from our analysis. In order to heed Garcetti\u2019s admonition against\\nsolely relying on the written description of an individual\u2019s occupation, we will\\nconsider Mississippi\u2019s statutory language, viewing it as one factor among many.\\nThis is consistent with our holding in Davis.\\n\\n                                        11\\n\\x0c    Case: 12-60905        Document: 00512446675          Page: 12      Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        No. 12-60905\\n\\n       Turning now to the present matter, the district court concluded that\\nGibson had shown that Kilpatrick violated his First Amendment rights, and in\\nso doing, explained that under Davis, Gibson\u2019s reports constituted citizen speech.\\nThe court supported this legal conclusion with the following facts: (1) Gibson\\nreported his suspicions to agencies outside of his chain of command; (2) there\\nwas no evidence to show that Gibson\u2019s duties included making reports to the FBI\\nor DEA; and (3) there was a lack of evidence regarding the context in which\\nGibson reported his suspicions other than that the reports were confidential.7\\nThese facts make this case superficially resemble this court\u2019s decision in Davis.\\n       However, Gibson\u2019s speech is complicated by additional factors not fully\\ndiscussed by the district court. Although Gibson\u2019s precise job description is not\\ncontained in the record, we can consider surrounding facts to determine whether\\nhis speech is related to any conceivable job duties. See Charles, 522 F.3d at 514.\\nThe circumstances surrounding the incident, from how Gibson learned of the\\nmisuse of the gasoline card to his involvement in the investigation, speak\\nvolumes about his actual duties as the Chief of Police. First, Kilpatrick\u2019s use of\\nthe city gasoline card was brought to Gibson\u2019s attention through a subordinate.\\nThe fact that the complaint came to him in a professional capacity and through\\nthe chain of command reveals that managing and responding to allegations of\\nthe misuse of civic funds was likely within the scope of his employment. See\\nDavis, 518 F.3d at 313 (citing Williams, 480 F.3d at 694) (considering whether\\nthe speech reflects a \u201cspecial knowledge\u201d gained by virtue of one\u2019s employment);\\nsee also Briscoe v. Jefferson Cnty., 500 F. App\u2019x 274, 278 (5th Cir. 2012)\\n(unpublished) (per curiam) (holding that the appellant\u2019s use of her \u201cspecial\\n\\n\\n       7\\n         The district court also held that, in the absence of evidence regarding Gibson\u2019s duties,\\nhe was \u201cmore likely involved [in] responding to complaints from private citizens than making\\nthem himself.\u201d However, this is speculation, and not based on facts in the record. We may not\\nbase our decisions on presumptions, regardless of how logical they may be. See Riley, 275 F.\\nApp\u2019x at 389.\\n\\n                                               12\\n\\x0c    Case: 12-60905       Document: 00512446675        Page: 13     Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      No. 12-60905\\n\\nknowledge\u201d of a record-keeping policy in order to substantiate a complaint is a\\nfactor indicating that her speech was official).\\n       Second, Gibson\u2019s decision to report to agencies outside of his chain of\\ncommand does not necessarily show that he spoke as a citizen. Given his\\nposition, there was arguably no one else to whom Gibson could confidentially\\nreport the information. Gibson was the \u201cchief law enforcement officer,\u201d see Miss.\\nCode Ann. \u00a7 21-21-1, and according to the district court\u2019s findings of fact, the\\nonly entities to which he could have reported within the chain of command were\\nKilpatrick and the Board.               Reporting to Kilpatrick\u2014the suspected\\nperpetrator\u2014clearly was undesirable, while reporting to the Board might have\\nrequired public disclosure of Gibson\u2019s suspicions, perhaps endangering the\\nsubsequent investigation. Indeed, it appears that once Board members learned\\nof the investigation, one of them informed Kilpatrick. The state agencies Gibson\\ncontacted may well have been the most appropriate entities to receive the\\ninformation, a fact other courts have found instructive. See Patterson v. City of\\nEarlington, 650 F. Supp. 2d 674, 680 (W.D. Ky. 2009) (holding that a police\\nchief\u2019s report of a mayor\u2019s alleged election law violations to state police is not\\nprotected because state police were the most appropriate authority to carry out\\nthe investigation); Mantle v. City of Country Club Hills, No. 4:07-CV-55 (CEJ),\\n2008 WL 3853432, at *4 (E.D. Mo. Aug. 15, 2008) (holding that a police chief\u2019s\\nreport of a mayor\u2019s criminal conduct to a municipal court judge is not protected\\nbecause the police chief had no departmental supervisor and the judge was the\\nmost appropriate authority to whom he could report).8\\n\\n       8\\n         Kilpatrick argues that Gibson\u2019s decision to contact individuals at the FBI and DEA\\nwith whom he had previously worked indicates that he went through professional channels\\nto make the report. However, this is unpersuasive. Gibson could have contacted these\\nindividuals because he had a personal relationship with them by virtue of the fact that they\\nmet while working together, which would indicate that the speech was private. It is also\\npossible that these were the only people that Gibson could contact due to a limited regional\\npresence of these federal agencies. We simply do not know. Since there is little evidence as\\n\\n                                            13\\n\\x0c    Case: 12-60905       Document: 00512446675        Page: 14     Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      No. 12-60905\\n\\n       Third, it appears that Gibson was able to monitor Kilpatrick\u2019s use of the\\ngasoline card only because Kilpatrick was required to come to the police\\ndepartment to collect it. Gibson fully took advantage of the authority afforded\\nto him as Chief of Police, and he instructed his police officers to participate in\\nthe investigation by monitoring Kilpatrick\u2019s activities; he even sent a copy of the\\nofficial police logs to the OSA.        Although Gibson does not allege that his\\nparticipation in the investigation is protected, we consider his involvement\\nbecause it reflects his actual authority and ability to investigate and detect\\ncrime. It supports our conclusion that Gibson was acting as a law enforcement\\nofficer doing his job, not as a private citizen fulfilling his civic duty.\\n       Finally, Mississippi law reinforces what the facts surrounding the\\ninvestigation show\u2014that his \u201cprimary responsibility [was] the prevention and\\ndetection of crime . . . [and] the apprehension of criminals.\u201d See Miss. Code Ann.\\n\u00a7 45-6-3(c). Gibson, as Chief of Police, was the City of Drew\u2019s \u201cchief law\\nenforcement officer\u201d and had \u201ccontrol and supervision of all police officers\\nemployed by\u201d the city. Id. \u00a7 21-21-1. While we are not exclusively relying on the\\nstatute\u2019s definition to understand the duties of the Chief of Police, the statute\\nweighs in favor of finding Gibson\u2019s speech as part of his professional\\nresponsibilities.\\n       Gibson\u2019s argument that reporting illegal activity is the duty of all citizens,\\nand therefore must constitute protected citizen speech, does not alter our\\nconclusion. See Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 419 (\u201cSo long as employees are speaking as\\ncitizens about matters of public concern, they must face only those speech\\nrestrictions that are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and\\neffectively.\u201d).   Other courts have rightly rejected similar arguments.                  In\\nparticular, the D.C. Circuit in Bowie v. Maddox stated that:\\n\\n\\nto how Gibson knew these individuals and why he contacted them, we cannot say that this fact\\nweighs in favor of either official or citizen speech.\\n\\n                                            14\\n\\x0c   Case: 12-60905     Document: 00512446675     Page: 15   Date Filed: 11\/19\/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 No. 12-60905\\n\\n      The critical question under Garcetti is not whether the speech at\\n      issue has a civilian analogue, but whether it was performed\\n      \u201cpursuant to . . . official duties.\u201d A test that allows a First\\n      Amendment retaliation claim to proceed whenever the government\\n      employee can identify a civilian analogue for his speech is about as\\n      useful as a mosquito net made of chicken wire: [a]ll official speech,\\n      viewed at a sufficient level of abstraction, has a civilian analogue.\\n653 F.3d 45, 48 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).       Gibson\u2019s argument\\nfunctionally reads an unsupported exception into Garcetti\u2019s holding that \u201cwhen\\npublic employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the\\nemployees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the\\nConstitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\u201d\\n547 U.S. at 421. He would reverse this language, and instead of looking to\\nwhether statements were made as part of an employee\u2019s official duties, he would\\nask only whether the speech could be classified as citizen speech and, if so, end\\nthe inquiry. This is not Garcetti\u2019s holding. See Bowie, 653 F.3d at 48.\\n      Gibson acted as the Chief of Police when he contacted various federal and\\nstate law enforcement agencies to report misuse of the city gasoline card.\\nBecause we conclude that Gibson acted pursuant to his official job duties in\\nmaking the reports, we need not consider the remaining prongs of the First\\nAmendment retaliation test, since he cannot show that Kilpatrick violated his\\nFirst Amendment rights. In the absence of such a showing, Gibson cannot\\novercome Kilpatrick\u2019s qualified immunity defense.

Defendant HIL moved for summary judgment, arguing that all of Johnson\\'s theories fail. This case requires the Court to consider several novel legal questions in light of the Supreme Court\\'s recent opinions in Gebser v. Logo Vista Indep. School Dist, 524 U.S. 274, 118 S.Ct. 1989, 141 L.Ed.2d 277 (1998), and Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001), delineating the tests for sexual discrimination under Title IX and implied private rights of action, respectively.\\nAfter carefully considering all issues, the Court holds that Johnson has not adequately pled the hostile environment aspect of her sexual discrimination claim under Title IX and that, furthermore, the quid pro quo element of her claim also fails because she has not shown that HIL had notice of the activity. On the other hand, the Court concludes that the Department of Education has reasonably construed \u00a7 901 of Title IX to forbid retaliation to the extent that this prohibition is premised on opposition to intentional discrimination. This prohibition is therefore enforceable via the existing implied private right of action under that section. The Court need not analyze whether a separate implied private right of action exists and Plaintiffs claim for retaliation may proceed.[3]\\n\\nI.\\nThe facts in this case, although somewhat disputed at critical points, are relatively straightforward. Plaintiff Wanda *682 Johnson is a 44 year-old woman and a former student at the Health Institute of Louisville (\"HIL\"). During October 2000, she enrolled in HIL to complete the academic requirements to become a licensed practical nurse. By the summer of 2001, when Johnson began her third quarter, she took a month-long class with Nurse Instructor Donte Wheat. The course included a weekly three-hour classroom lecture and one day of clinical work at Kosair Children\\'s Hospital (\"Kosair\").\\nDuring this month, Johnson claims Wheat made several comments and physically touched her in ways that made her exceedingly uncomfortable and unable to focus on her education. The specifics of her claim are important. First, Johnson says that on the days she worked at Kosair, Wheat required the students to sit with him in the cafeteria. She says that each day, she sat down first and he would come sit next to her. Allegedly, he would press his leg up against the side of hers under the crowded table. This happened on at least four occasions. She says, she moved her leg away and he would try and scoot over to touch her again. Similarly, she alleges that once while they were on an elevator, Wheat pressed the front of his body against her back. Second, Johnson claims that several of Wheat\\'s comments in class were entirely inappropriate. She says he \"almost all the time\" referred to breasts as \"boobies\" and \"cha-chas,\" the buttocks as the \"ass,\" and at least once called the penis \"dick.\" Johnson says this was offensive and degrading to her. These remarks occurred during the twicea-week lectures. Third, she alleges that on one occasion, Johnson was demonstrating electrocution therapy and asked the class where the human body would most strongly feel the shock. Students responded that it would be felt by the hands, the feet, and other extremities. Wheat apparently told them they were all wrong and said the correct answer was \"the dick\" and said that the thought of that put him in pain.\\nFurthermore, Johnson alleges that on the last day of her\\' clinical at Kosair, Wheat sexually propositioned her. She says that she made a mistake while assessing a patient\\'s blood pressure and that this incited Wheat\\'s alleged bad temper. He apparently exclaimed, \"What makes you think you have the luxury of making mistakes?\" He then reached for her arm, put one hand on her elbow and another on her shoulder. She claims she turned away from him and he reached across with one arm to turn her back. She responded, \"I\\'m not interested.\" He replied \"That\\'s the wrong answer to give on the last day of clinical.\" It is undisputed that he failed her. At her subsequent evaluation meeting, Wheat told her she failed because she gave the wrong answer to \"one question.\" When she asked which one, he responded, \"You know what question it is.\" Additionally, it also appears that Wheat initially gave Johnson a satisfactory evaluation but then later changed it after this event. Wheat vehemently disputes Johnson\\'s interpretation of this incident and contends he never sexually propositioned her.\\nShortly after these events, for reasons not entirely clear, Wheat left HIL. Johnson contends Wheat left because he was frustrated by the horrible evaluations students gave him. Wheat has not provided a response. In any event, HIL says that Johnson allegedly began circulating rumors that Wheat left because she filed a complaint against him with the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights (\"KCHR\"). Johnson says the KCHR told Johnson not to discuss her complaint and that she did not circulate rumors. Somehow, though, it appears that it was common knowledge among Johnson\\'s classmates that Johnson *683 had taken some form of action against Wheat.\\nWhen HIL President Michael Hendricks learned about these rumors, he called Johnson to his office for a meeting. At that meeting Johnson told Wheat that she had filed charges against Wheat with the Kentucky Commission for Human Rights (\"KCHR\"), but refused to tell him what Wheat had allegedly done. Hendricks said KCHR had not contacted him and that he was concerned she was instead spreading rumors because Wheat failed her. Hendricks asked Johnson to bring him proof that she complained to KCHR or she would be subject to dismissal for dishonesty under HIL\\'s Code of Conduct. Because she allegedly never provided such documentation, HIL held a Code of Conduct hearing and expelled Johnson for dishonesty.\\nJohnson\\'s account is quite different. She claims that after Wheat failed her, she first called the police and said she was being sexually harassed. Johnson says she did not place the phone call because she received a failing grade, but because she knew she had to take another class with Wheat as a result of the failure and she wanted him to stop his derogatory behavior. The police put her in touch with the Rape and Crisis Information Center. She says the Center instructed her she was entitled to counseling, although she did not pursue it. The Center also told her she could contact the KCHR.\\nAfter receiving this advice, Johnson claims that she did in fact report Wheat to the KCHR before her initial meeting with Wheat and completed an official questionnaire detailing the events as they unfolded. She also voiced her concern, in the form of a phone call to the state\\'s Board of Nursing. It is unclear what came of this action. The KCHR however, did respond to Johnson\\'s complaint, ultimately determining that it lacked jurisdiction over schools. Officials at KCHR told her they would forward her complaint to the state\\'s department of education.\\nPlaintiff says that when Hendricks called her in to discuss the rumor he was defensive and said Mr. Wheat was not violent, that Wheat would go after her financially, and that she had \"better be sure\" she was telling the truth in making her allegations. She further told Hendricks that KCHR told her not to discuss the details of her complaint with anyone and that she could not discuss it with him. In response, she says Hendricks requested proof that she had filed a complaint with KCHR and said he would expel her if it turned out she was lying. She says she tried to get this information immediately, but that the KCHR did not typically provide additional information on complaints, and was reluctant to do so in this case. As a result, she says, it took several weeks for her to get any proof.\\nIn response to this request, some time before the Code of Conduct Board met, Johnson says she provided Hendricks with a letter from the Commission indicating that she attempted to file a charge against Wheat. This letter informed Hendricks that the Commission took the position that it did not have jurisdiction over the matter and thus could not have accepted a harassment charge against Wheat from Plaintiff. This letter did not say, however, as Hendricks subsequently told Johnson he really wanted, that Johnson filed the claim on a specific date before the initial August 21 meeting where Johnson told Hendricks she had filed charges. It is unclear whether Hendricks initially told Johnson if this letter was sufficient; she claims he gave her the impression that it was enough. Hendricks later told her, however, that the letter made no mention of sexual harassment and did not confirm she filed the *684 complaint prior to their meeting. It is unclear whether the Code of Conduct Board took this into consideration when it expelled her.[4]\\n\\nII.\\nIn a series of decisions over the last 25 years, the Supreme Court has outlined the contours of Title IX liability. Beginning with its 1979 decision in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 704, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), the Court established that Title IX is enforceable through an implied private cause of action. In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60,112 S.Ct. 1028, 117 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992), the Court delineated the available remedies, holding that monetary damages are available for Title IX violations by a school district, but only in so far as the plaintiff proves intentional discrimination. Most recently, in Gebser, 524 U.S. 274, 118 S.Ct. 1989, the Court set forth the legal standards for institutional liability where a student alleges sexual harassment by a teacher. Rejecting assertions that an institution could be held vicariously liable for an employee\\'s actions, the Court held that Title IX liability attaches only when a school official \"who at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures on the recipient\\'s behalf has actual knowledge of discrimination\" and fails to correct such behavior in a manner that amounts to deliberate indifference. Id. at 290, 118 S.Ct. 1989 (emphasis added).\\nThus, to proceed on a Title IX claim against an educational institution a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case by showing that: (1) she was subjected to quid pro quo sexual harassment or a sexually hostile environment; (2) she provided actual notice of the situation to an \"appropriate person,\" who was, at a minimum, an official of the educational entity with authority to take corrective action and to end discrimination; and (3.) the institution\\'s response to the harassment amounted to \"deliberate indifference.\" Klemencic v. Ohio State Univ., 263 F.3d 504 (6th Cir. 2001); see Morse v. Regents of the Univ. of Colorado, 154 F.3d 1124, 1127-28 (10th Cir.1998) (citing Gebser, 524 U.S. at 289-90, 118 S.Ct. 1989). The Court addresses each of the Gebser elements separately.\\n\\nA.\\nJohnson alleges that Wheat\\'s actions amounted to both a quid pro quo sexual proposition and subjected her to a sexually hostile environment. HIL vigorously disputes both of these claims.\\n\\n1.\\nTo succeed on a quid pro quo claim, a plaintiff must allege that \"a tangible employment [or educational] action resulted from a refusal to submit to a supervisor\\'s sexual demands.\" Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 753, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998); see also Wills v. Brown Univ., 184 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.1999) (defining quid pro quo harassment as occurring \"when some benefit or adverse action, such as change in salary at work or a grade in school is made to depend on providing sexual favors to someone in authority...\"). Courts considering quid pro quo claims have applied the same standard to Title IX and Title VII cases. See Crandell v. *685 New York College of Osteopathic Medicine, 87 F.Supp.2d 304, 318 n. 145 (S.D.N.Y.2000); Liu v. Striuli 36 F.Supp.2d 452, 465 (D.R.I.1999).\\nJohnson\\'s allegations sufficiently allege such a showing. She claims that on her last day of class, Wheat touched her at which point she told him that she was not interested. Despite previously giving her favorable reviews, Johnson alleges Wheat decided to fail her based on this encounter. Wheat counters that this conversation had nothing to do with his sexual interest in her and instead was entirely about her interest in the class and the lack of effort Johnson put forth. This is an entirely reasonable argument. However, it is also a matter of interpretation. Viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Johnson, a reasonable jury might also conclude that Wheat did fail her because she refused his alleged advances. Therefore, Johnson has sufficiently alleged quid pro quo harassment.\\n\\n2.\\nHIL also contends Johnson\\'s allegations are insufficient to constitute hostile environment harassment. Here the question is much closer. To establish a prima facie case for hostile environment under Title IX, Johnson must produce evidence that her educational experience was \"permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult that [was] sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions\" of her education and create a sexually hostile environment. See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993); see also Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 787-89, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (discussing the standard applied in Title VII cases and noting that the behavior must unreasonably interfere with an employee\\'s work performance).[5] To be actionable, the offensive behavior must be based on sex, rather than personal animus or other reasons. Frazier v. Fairhaven Sch. Comm., 276 F.3d 52, 66 (1st Cir.2002). The conduct complained of is judged both objectively and subjectively; it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile. Black v. Zaring, 104 F.3d 822 (6th Cir. 1997).\\nFrom the record, it is clear that plaintiff viewed her environment as hostile and abusive. The remaining question is whether a reasonable person in plaintiffs circumstances would find the educational environment so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive as to undermine plaintiffs educational experience and deny her equal access to an institution\\'s resources and opportunities. See Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ, 526 U.S. 629, 650, 119 S.Ct. 1661, 143 L.Ed.2d 839 (1999). In determining whether a plaintiff has established that an environment is hostile or abusive, a court must look specifically at (1) the conduct\\'s severity; (2) the frequency of the abusive conduct; (3) whether it is physically threatening or humiliating rather than merely offensive; and (4) whether it unreasonably interferes with the plaintiffs performance. See Harris, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. 367. In applying these factors, the Supreme Court has stated that sporadic use of abusive language, gender related jokes, or occasional episodes of *686 harassment do not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment. 524 U.S. at 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275.\\nJohnson\\'s argument in this case is premised on four facts. First, Johnson says Wheat inappropriately touched her by sitting too close together on at least five occasions, including at lunch and on the elevator. Second, she says he often referred to sexual body parts with perverse slang. Third, she alleges that he talked openly in class about his genitalia. Fourth, Johnson claims on the last day of her clinical, he put his hands on her arms and shoulders before allegedly propositioning her. The Court has looked at a myriad of other cases addressing this same issue. The specific conduct here seems quite a bit less severe than other instances of sexually hostile educational claims. See, e.g., Doe v. New Philadelphia Public Schools Bd. Of Educ, 996 F.Supp. 741 (N.D.Ohio 1998) (grade school teacher had sexual relationship with student that resulted in the teacher\\'s pregnancy); Massey v. Akron City Board of Education, 82 F.Supp.2d 735 (N.D.Ohio 2000) (teacher\/counselor fondled young boys, commented on their physique, phoned students at home, and engaged in sexual relations with at least one high school student); Hayut v. State University of New York, 127 F.Supp.2d 333 (N.D.N.Y.2000) (summary judgment denied where teacher repeatedly referred to student in class as \"Monica Lewinsky\" and asked her how \"Bill\" was doing); Flores v. Saulpaugh, 115 F.Supp.2d 319 (N.D.N.Y.2000) (summary judgment denied when teacher put his arm around student, looked at her in a sexual manner, commented on her appearance, and stated that she should find a more mature boyfriend).\\nRather, the harassment complained of here is more akin to those instances where courts granted summary judgment. See, e.g., Gallant v. Board of Trustees of California State University, 997 F.Supp. 1231 (N.D.Cal.1998) (professor\\'s graphic comments about his sexual desire for another man and a greeting kiss on student\\'s cheek does not rise to the level of severe or pervasive sexual harassment); Klemencic v. Ohio State University, 10 F.Supp.2d 911 (S.D.Ohio 1998) (coach did not create a sexually hostile environment by asking the student to go out with him and sending her a sexually suggestive magazine article because the acts were not severe or pervasive).[6] In sum, the absence of severe conduct directed at Johnson seems to set this case apart even from those that other courts have found insufficient.\\nNevertheless, one might consider this a close question. It is always difficult to analyze conduct with which one thoroughly abhors in the light of statutory and judicial commands. However, analyzing several of the other Davis factors strongly support dismissing the claim here. Wheat\\'s conduct was not \"pervasive\" in the sense that there was severe harassment on a regular basis. Nor can the comments Wheat made in class, although arguably entirely offensive, be classified as sufficiently humiliating and frequent to pass muster. Those comments are precisely the kind which the Supreme Court has said do not *687 constitute discrimination. Last, it appears Johnson never stopped going to class. Title IX requires that the harassment clearly interfere with her education. In this case, although it is true Johnson and Wheat had a less than amicable relationship, it does not appear, based on the standard the law requires this court to apply, that his tendency to allegedly create a \"sexually hostile environment\" interfered with her education. The Court therefore concludes that Johnson has not sufficiently alleged that a hostile environment existed under Title IX. That part of her claim is dismissed.\\n\\nB.\\nAs to the second requirement, the Supreme Court has held that, to establish a basis for institutional liability and recover damages, a Title IX litigant must demonstrate that \"an official who at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures on the federal funding recipient\\'s behalf must have had actual knowledge of the facts underlying the Title IX claim. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 290, 118 S.Ct. 1989.[7] Neither constructive notice nor apparent authority will suffice.\\nThe Court has not found any Sixth Circuit case interpreting the contours of the Gebser notice requirement. This case raises two important questions which Gebser left open. First, must the institution receive notice that Plaintiff herself was subjected to a sexually hostile environment or is notice from other individuals in this same environment sufficient? Lower courts have split on this question. It appears that all district courts addressing this issue have adopted the latter position, holding that \"the institution must have possessed enough knowledge of the harassment that it reasonably could have responded with remedial measures to address the kind of harassment upon which plaintiffs legal claim is based.\" Folkes v. New York College of Osteopathic Med., 214 F.Supp.2d 273 (E.D.N.Y.2002); see also Hart v. Paint Valley Local Sch. Dist, 2002 WL 31951264, *6-7, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEIS 25720, *22 (S.D.Ohio 2002); Frederick v. Simpson College, 149 F.Supp.2d 826 (S.D.Iowa 2001); Crandell v. New York College of Osteopathic Med., 87 F.Supp.2d 304 (S.D.N.Y.2000); Gordon v. Ottumwa Comm. Sch. Dist, 115 F.Supp.2d 1077, 1082 (S.D.Iowa 2000); Massey v. Akron City Bd. of Educ, 82 F.Supp.2d 735, 744 (N.D.Ohio 2000); Doe v. School Admin. Dist. No. 19, 66 F.Supp.2d 57, 63 (D.Me. 1999). On the other hand, the Fourth Circuit has interpreted Gebser\\'s requirement of \"actual knowledge of discrimination in the recipient\\'s programs\" to require \"a showing that school district officials possessed actual knowledge of the discriminatory conduct in question.\" Baynard v. Malone, 268 F.3d 228, 237-38 (4th Cir. 2001). The Fourth Circuit concluded that, while a principal should have been aware of the potential for abuse based on reports from other students, the institution could not be held liable because there was no evidence indicating that the principal was actually aware that the student-plaintiff was being abused.\\nTo decide which notice requirement governs, the Court returns to Gebser, where the Supreme Court concluded that, consistent with Congress\\'s authority under the spending clause, institutional liability must be premised on \"actual knowledge of discrimination in the recipient\\'s programs.\" 524 U.S. at 290, 118 S.Ct. 1989. In this *688 Court\\'s view, the Gebser notice standard does not require that the offending instructor actually commit previous acts of harassment against the plaintiff-student and that the plaintiff-student complain before the institution may be held liable for the instructor\\'s subsequent repeated misconduct under Title IX. Actual knowledge of intentional discrimination and actual knowledge of the actual plaintiffs experiences are two different things; requiring the latter imposes a substantially higher test than the former. Consistent with the majority of other courts, the Court thus finds that the actual notice standard is met when an appropriate official has actual knowledge of a substantial risk of abuse to students based on prior complaints by other students.[8]\\nHere, though it is true Johnson herself never complained specifically about these instances, Hendricks was allegedly aware of four facts.[9] First, several students in their evaluations gave Wheat negative remarks and described him as \"intimidating.\" Second, Johnson claims that Ronetta Potts, a Nurse Educator employed by Kosair, where Wheat taught the clinical, complained vociferously to Hendricks. At one point, Potts apparently faxed Hendricks a letter stating Wheat was inappropriate with patients and families; made inappropriate comments, such as questioning the morality of a patient for being a single unwed mother; and asked offensive questions and was condescending towards her. Third, Johnson claims that another student complained to Hendricks about Wheat\\'s behavior and went so far as to compare Wheat to her abusive husband. Fourth, Johnson says that she went to Hendricks before her final clinical at Kosair and complained that Wheat was generally inappropriate in class. She further says she was afraid to tell him the details because she knew Hendricks and Wheat were friends and that Wheat was already acting threatening towards her. Johnson says she did not tell Hendricks about the touching.[10]\\nAt this stage the Court cannot say for sure whether these comments and *689 Attitudes were directed at women (and therefore are covered by Title IX) or were instead indicative of an across-the-board tough instructor. Indeed, the Court need not determine whether Hendricks had knowledge of conduct which might constitute discrimination against female students generally. That being said, with regard to the remaining quid pro quo claim, it appears Hendricks received absolutely no previous complaints of sexual advances or threats by Wheat against female students. This fact is critical to the remaining quid pro quo part of Johnson\\'s sexual discrimination claim.\\nOne could say, however, that the Gebser actual notice prong does not require such specificity: the relationship between the type of discrimination complained of, and the type of notice the school official receives need not perfectly correspond. The Court has found no other federal court opinion discussing this second issue left open by Gebser. The Court concludes, however, that the Gebser opinion requires a more stringent correlation. As the Supreme Court explained in Gebser, Congress enacted Title IX, pursuant to its spending clause power, \"to avoid the use of federal resources to support discriminatory practices\" and \"to provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices.\" 524 U.S at 286, 118 S.Ct. 1989 (citing Cannon, 441 U.S. at 704, 99 S.Ct. 1946). In this respect, Title IX conditions \"an offer of federal funding on a promise by the recipient not to discriminate, in what amounts essentially to a contract between the Government and the recipient of funds.\" Id. at 286, 118 S.Ct. 1989. Based on this underlying principle, the Court concluded that a recipient of federal funds could not be held liable for failing to prohibit sex discrimination, if it lacked notice that such discrimination took place and therefore lacked \"an opportunity to take action to end the harassment or to limit further harassment.\" Id. at 289, 118 S.Ct. 1989.\\nApplying this contractual theory to this case, notice of a tendency to create a sexually offensive environment and notice of a tendency to sexually proposition a student are very different. HIL had knowledge of facts which may possibly have been sufficient notice of a sexually offensive atmosphere. However, under the Supreme Court\\'s Title IX analysis, an institution\\'s opportunity to respond and remedy a situation depends on its actual notice of the alleged discrimination; the scope of that notice, then, must also be a consideration in determining the institution\\'s liability. HIL had no notice of the quid quo pro proposition. The Court, therefore, declines to find that the minimal notice HIL possessed is sufficient to create liability for Johnson\\'s quid pro quo claim. As such, Johnson\\'s quid pro quo claim must also be dismissed.\\n\\nIII.\\nThe Court next considers whether Title IX provides Johnson a cause of action and a private remedy against HIL for its allegedly retaliatory actions.[11] This question *690 requires the Court to explore whether the Supreme Court\\'s jurisprudence creating a private right of action for intentionally discriminatory acts also permits claims premised on retaliation. This is an issue of first impression in the Sixth Circuit; other circuits have split on this question.[12] The Court therefore proceeds reviewing the relevant statutory and regulation provisions and then analyzing the effect of the Supreme Court\\'s opinion in Sandoval on the availability of a cause of action for retaliation under Title IX.\\n\\nA.\\nWhen Congress enacted Title IX in 1972, it had two principal objectives in mind: \"To avoid the use of federal resources to support discriminatory practices\" and \"to provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices.\" Cannon, 441 U.S. at 704, 99 S.Ct. 1946. Towards those ends, Title IX contains two distinct parts. First, \u00a7 901 provides that \"no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, *691 or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance ....\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a).[13] Section 901, then, can be said to create the right.\\nSecond, in section \u00a7 902, Congress created an elaborate administrative enforcement scheme for Title IX. Pursuant to \u00a7 902, any federal department or agency that \"is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to any education program or activity\" is \"authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of \u00a7 901. To do so, agencies are required to \"issue rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability,\" which do not \"become effective unless and until approved by the President.\" [14] In this way, Section 902 provides *692 administrative agencies with powers to add greater specificity to the \u00a7 901 right.\\nUnder this \u00a7 902 authority, the Department of Education promulgated a regulation, 34 C.F.R., Part 100, which provides:\\n(e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part.\\n34 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.7(e) (emphasis added).[15]\\nImportantly, the Department of Education\\'s Title IX regulations, which establish rights under \"this part\" for purposes of 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.7(e), forbid both intentional discrimination and practices that have a disparate impact, but are not intentionally discriminatory. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3. The regulations further require \"affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination,\" 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3(b)(6)(I), and permit affirmative action \"even in the absence of such prior discrimination,\" 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3(b)(6)(ii). Based on this scheme, Johnson alleges Congress has permitted her to sue HIL, for retaliatory actions taken in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nB.\\nThe Court begins its analysis by considering the Supreme Court\\'s recent opinion in Sandoval 532 U.S. 275, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517. In chat case, the Court clarified and articulated the approach courts must now follow in determining whether to imply a private right of action from a statute and, in so doing, analyzed a regulation promulgated under Title VI.[16] The Supreme Court\\'s analysis of the relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 601 and 602 of Title VI in Sandoval largely informs this Court\\'s analysis of \u00a7\u00a7 901 and 902 of Title IX. Cannon, 441 U.S. at 694-99, 99 S.Ct. 1946 (noting that Title IX \"was patterned after Title VI\" therefore finding based on the statutory language of Title VI should logically extend to Title IX as well).\\nIn Sandoval, the Supreme Court considered whether a private individual could bring an action for violations of regulations forbidding disparate impact practices. The Court began by stating three principles which framed its analysis. First, private individuals may sue to enforce \u00a7\u00a7 601 and 901 to obtain both injunctive relief and monetary damages. See Sandoval 532 *693 U.S. at 279-80, 121 S.Ct. 1511 (citing Cannon, 441 U.S. at 694-99, 99 S.Ct. 1946 (holding that a private right of action exists to enforce Title IX)); Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 72, 112 S.Ct. 1028, 117 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992) (holding that both monetary and equitable remedies are available under a Title IX action). Second, \" \u00a7 601 prohibits only intentional discrimination.\" Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 280-82, 121 S.Ct. 1511. Third, some \"regulations promulgated under \u00a7 602 of Title VI may validly proscribe activities that have a disparate impact on racial groups, even though such activities are permissible under \u00a7 601.\" Id. at 281, 121 S.Ct. 1511.\\nThe Court then turned to classify the regulation at issue: a Department of Justice regulation promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 602 of Title VI that forbade recipients of federal funding from \"utilizing criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individual to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin.\" 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.104(b)(2)(1999). Recognizing that Title VI itself only reached acts of intentional discrimination, the plaintiff in Sandoval did not allege a violation of Title VI per se. Instead, the plaintiff claimed the Alabama Department of Public Safety\\'s policy of administering all tests for drivers\\' licenses in English had a uniquely discriminating effect on minorities. This disparate impact, the plaintiff argued, violated the Justice Department\\'s regulation. In effect, the plaintiff wanted the Court to find that, implicit in the grant of \u00a7 602 authority to federal agencies to enact regulations was a private right to sue under \u00a7 602 for violations of those regulations. The Court refused to imply such a private right of action into \u00a7 602\\'s language.\\nTo reach this conclusion, the Court distinguished between two types of regulations an agency might enact under its \u00a7 602 authority. On one side were those regulations that applied \u00a7 601\\'s ban on intentional discrimination. Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 284, 121 S.Ct. 1511. In those cases, the Court explained:\\nWe do not doubt that regulations applying \u00a7 601\\'s ban on intentional discrimination are covered by the cause of action to enforce that section. Such regulations, if valid and reasonable, authoritatively construe the statute itself, see NationsBank of N.C., N.A v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 257, 115 S.Ct. 810, 130 L.Ed.2d 740 (1995); Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), and it is therefore meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the statute. A Congress that intends the statute to be enforced through a private cause of action intends the authoritative interpretation of the statute to be so enforced as well.\\nId.\\nConsequently, the Court reasoned, a regulation tied to effectuating \u00a7 601\\'s ban on intentional discrimination simply further policed the type of discrimination that \u00a7 601 already prohibited. Therefore, in such cases, to allege a violation of a regulation enacted under \u00a7 602\\'s authority, was not to sue under an independent cause of action for a violation of a particular regulation or even \u00a7 602, but rather was to sue for a violation of a right created by \u00a7 601. The regulation (enacted under \u00a7 602\\'s authority), the Court reasoned, simply further explained what that \u00a7 601 right entailed. In these cases, the Court concluded that it was unnecessary to consider whether an implied private right of action existed because the plaintiff was *694 simply exercising his already existing right to sue under \u00a7 601.\\nIn the second category were those regulations enacted under \u00a7 602 authority that went farther and \"[forbade] conduct that \u00a7 601 permits.\" Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 285, 121 S.Ct. 1511. In other words, the Court distinguished those regulations\\x97 like the one in Sandoval involving a disparate impact rule\\x97where the plaintiff alleged a violation of a regulation which prohibited discrimination without regard to intent. In those instances, the Court stated that the plaintiffs claim for a violation of the regulation was not covered by the \u00a7 601 ban on intentional discrimination; instead, the Court characterized the plaintiffs claim as a separate cause of action seeking relief under \u00a7 602. Because the plaintiffs claim in Sandoval was premised on a regulation that involved a disparate impact rule, as opposed to a claim of intentional discrimination, the Court placed it in this second category. Thus, the question presented in Sandoval, and the one the Court primarily addressed, was whether \u00a7 602 conferred a separate private right of action.[17] The Supreme Court held that \u00a7 602 conferred no such private right of action. Id.[18]\\n\\nC.\\nBased on the Sandoval framework, this Court must make two related determinations. First, the Court must analyze whether a claim based on the Department of Education\\'s anti-retaliation regulation effectuates \u00a7 901\\'s anti-discrimination mandate. Second, applying Chevron, the Court must find the regulation is valid and commands deference. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 284, 121 S.Ct. 1511 (noting that regulations applying \u00a7 601\\'s ban on intentional discrimination, if valid and reasonable under Chevron, authoritatively construe the statute itself and are covered by the \u00a7 601 right of action). If the regulation passes both of these tests, Johnson\\'s claim premised on \u00a7 100.7(e), is encompassed by the well-established private right of action under Title IX for intentional discrimination.\\n\\n1.\\nAs to the first question, HIL argues that this Court should adopt the Eleventh Circuit\\'s reasoning in Jackson v. Birmingham *695 Board of Educ, 309 F.3d 1333, 1344-48 (11th Cir.2002), where a court considering the same question presented here held that \"[n]othing in the text [of \u00a7 901] indicates any congressional concern with retaliation that might be visited on those who complain of Title IX violations. Indeed, the statute makes no mention of retaliation at all.\" Id. at 1344. Drawing from Sandoval\\'s instruction that courts should not imply private rights of actions where Congress does not explicitly designate them, the Eleventh Circuit reasoned that \u00a7 901\\'s anti-discrimination mandate did not encompass claims for retaliation. Id. at 1345-46. See also Atkinson v. Lafayette College, 2002 WL 123449, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1432 (E.D.Pa.2002) (relying on Sandoval to find that the court lacked the power to imply a private right of action for retaliation under Title IX); Litman v. George Mason University, 156 F.Supp.2d 579 (E.D.Va.2001) (same).\\nThis Court respectfully disagrees and adopts the position more recently set forth by the Fourth Circuit in Peters v. Jenney, 327 F.3d 307 (4th Cir.2003) (addressing the same issue in the Title VI context). See also Frazier, 276 F.3d at 67 (establishing the standard a student must meet to prevail on a Title IX retaliation claim, but not discussing the effect of Sandoval on the court\\'s analysis); Burwell v. Pekin Comm. High Sch. Dist. 303, 213 F.Supp.2d 917, 934-25 (C.D.Ill.2002) (recognizing claim for retaliation under Title IX). In Peters, the Fourth Circuit reasoned that the text of Sandoval and Title IX did not require the court to analyze \u00a7 601\\'s text to determine whether Congress, as evidenced wholly by statutory intent, explicitly created an implied private right of action. 327 F.3d at 316-17. This was because Peters, like this Court, first analyzed whether \u00a7 100.7(e) \"applied \u00a7 601\\'s ban on intentional discrimination...\" Id. Drawing on the Peters approach, this Court, for several reasons, concludes that the anti-retaliation provision cuts to the core of \u00a7 901\\'s ban on intentional discrimination and is covered by that section\\'s existing cause of action.\\nFirst, as a doctrinal matter, a regulation that specifically prohibits retaliation for intentional discrimination does not prohibit any more action than \u00a7 901 already prohibits. That is, if the Sandoval Court refused to allow the claim in that case to proceed because it concluded the DOJ regulation forbade conduct that \u00a7 601 permitted, then the test here is whether \u00a7 100.7(e) prohibits conduct otherwise allowed by \u00a7 901. 532 U.S. at 285, 121 S.Ct. 1511 (concluding that it \"is clear now that the disparate-impact regulations do not simply apply \u00a7 601\\x97since they indeed forbid conduct that \u00a7 601 permits\\x97and therefore clear that the private right of action to enforce \u00a7 601 does not include a private right to enforce these regulations\"). The Court concludes, based on this test, that in so long as \u00a7 100.7(e) is used to challenge acts of intentional discrimination\\x97and therefore only prohibits conduct already prohibited by \u00a7 901\\x97the regulation is properly within the existing implied private right of action to enforce \u00a7 901 and does not attempt to forbid conduct \u00a7 901 otherwise permits. In as much as an intent to discriminate exists when someone is intentionally treated differently because of her gender, that intent clearly carries over to a context where someone intentionally chooses to expel a student based on actions she took in defense of her rights as a member of a particular gender. The purpose in both cases is the same: to punish someone for reasons that, but for intentional discrimination against their gender, would not exist.\\nSecond, the Supreme Court has implicitly recognized that the right to be free from retaliation is implicit in the right to be free from intentional discrimination. To begin, *696 in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229, 90 S.Ct. 400, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969), the Supreme Court considered whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982\\'s broad prohibition on discrimination on property transactions also allowed a claim for retaliation. Nothing in the text of \u00a7 1982 mentioned retaliation. The plaintiff alleged his neighborhood association retaliated against him because he attempted to lease his property to a black man. The plaintiff brought suit under \u00a7 1982,[19] which the board challenged, claiming the plaintiffs expulsion was not covered by \u00a7 1982\\'s anti-discrimination provision. Rejecting this assertion, the Supreme Court held that \"if that sanction, backed by a state court judgment, can be imposed, then Sullivan is punished for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities protected by \u00a7 1982. Such a sanction would give impetus to the perpetuation of racial restrictions on property.\" As several federal courts have noted, Sullivan can thus be construed to stand for the proposition that a prohibition on discrimination should be judicially construed to include an implicit prohibition on retaliation against those who oppose the prohibited discrimination. Peters, 327 F.3d at 317; Johnson v. Univ. of Cincinnati 215 F.3d 561, 576 (6th Cir.2000); Fair Employment Council v. BMC Mktg. Corp., 28 F.3d 1268, 1280 (D.C.Cir.1994).\\nFour years after Sullivan, the Court used the same logic and similarly recognized that, while 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 nowhere expressly bars retaliation,[20] retaliation must be actionable in order to effectuate those rights. Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). The Court held that even though a state employee has no right to employment, the state could not simply fire him for criticizing his employer. Id. at 597, 92 S.Ct. 2694. \"This would allow the government to produce a result which [it] could not command directly.\" Id. (citing Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958)). See also Crawford-El v. Britten, 523 U.S. 574, 588 n. 10, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998) (explaining that; \"retaliation offends the Constitution [because] it threatens to inhibit exercise of the protected right\" and \"is thus akin to an unconstitutional condition demanded for the receipt of a government-provided benefit\"). Importantly, both Sullivan and Perry involved antidiscrimination statutes written at the same level of generality as Title IX.\\nRelying on the Supreme Court\\'s statement of this principle; in these two contexts, numerous federal courts of appeals, including the Sixth Circuit, have similarly held that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, which broadly prohibits discrimination in contracting, also provides a cause of action for retaliation. See, e.g., Foley v. Univ. of Houston Sys., 324 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2003); Murrell v. Ocean Mecca Motel, Inc., 262 F.3d 253, 258 (4th Cir.2001); Johnson, 2 F.3d at 576; Andrews v. Lakeshore Rehab. Hosp., 140 F.3d 1405, 1411-13 (11th Cir. 1998); Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262, 1266-67 (10th Cir.1989); Fiedler v. Marumsco Christian Sch., 631 F.2d 1144, 1149 n. 7 (1980). Each of these opinions reached this conclusion, despite the fact \u00a7 1981\\x97like \u00a7\u00a7 1982 and 1983\\x97 says nothing about retaliation and \"only proscribes purposeful discrimination.\" *697 Peters, 327 F.3d at 318 (citing Murrell, 262 F.3d at 257).[21]\\nLast, this Court notes that, on several prior occasions, the Supreme Court has stated that Congress intended to prohibit a wide range of discriminatory actions when it enacted Title IX. In North Haven Board of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 102 S.Ct. 1912, 72 L.Ed.2d 299 (1982), the Court stated, \"[t]here is no doubt that if we are to give [Title IX] the scope that its origins dictate, we must accord it a sweep as broad as its language.\" Id. at 521, 102 S.Ct. 1912 (citing United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 801, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966)). The Court thus concluded that Title IX authorized the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to enact a regulation prohibiting gender discrimination in employment by federal fund recipients, even though employment itself was not mentioned in \u00a7 901. See also Franklin, 503 U.S. at 76, 112 S.Ct. 1028 (interpreting Title IX broadly to find that Title IX reaches student-on-student sexual harassment). Likewise, the Supreme Court has held that all available remedies are available to effectuate Title IX\\'s guarantees. Franklin, 503 U.S. at 69, 112 S.Ct. 1028 (\"the existence of a statutory right implies the existence of all necessary and appropriate remedies\"). In this case, to find that Johnson had a right to be free from intentional discrimination but receives no protection when she faces retaliation for asserting that right contradicts these decisions. In such a circumstance, it only makes practical sense that under Title IX one has the right to sue a defendant who prevents one from asserting her Title IX rights.\\n\\n2.\\nFinding that \u00a7 100.7(e) falls squarely within \u00a7 901\\'s ban on intentional discrimination, the Court must last determine whether \u00a7 100.7(e) is valid under Chevron and therefore commands this Court\\'s deference.\\nUnder the Chevron standard, a court inquires \"first whether the intent of Congress is clear as to the precise question at issue ... If so, that is the end of the matter.\" NationsBank of N.C., N.A v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 257, 115 S.Ct. 810, 130 L.Ed.2d 740 (1995). If, however:\\nthe statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\\'s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute. If the administrator\\'s reading fills a gap or defines a term in a way that is reasonable in light of the legislature\\'s revealed design, we give the administrator\\'s judgment controlling weight.\\nId. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\\nIn this case, the Department of Education is the agency historically \"charged with responsibility for administering Title IX.\" Cannon, 441 U.S. at 706-08, 99 S.Ct. 1946. Pursuant to this authority, the Department of Education promulgated \u00a7 100.7(e). Here, because Congress clearly did not explicitly authorize the Department of Education to enact a regulation prohibiting retaliation, Congress\\'s intent is not clear. The question therefore is whether the Department of Education could reasonably construe \u00a7 901 to authorize \u00a7 100.7(e).\\n*698 This Court concludes, in light of the principles and the long line of authority previously discussed, that the Department of Education can certainly be said to have acted reasonably in construing \u00a7 901 to forbid retaliation premised upon opposition to practices \u00a7 901 makes unlawful. Peters, 327 F.3d at 318. It \"is neither inconsistent with the text of [\u00a7 901] nor an unreasonable construction of that section for an agency to construe it to cover those who are purposefully injured for opposing the intentional discrimination Congress made unlawful via [\u00a7 901].\" Id. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Department of Education acted reasonably in enacting \u00a7 100.7(e) and its regulation is entitled to deference and must be given controlling weight under Chevron.\\nThe Court will enter an order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Plaintiff has also filed a motion to amend her complaint, adding a claim that HIL violated Title IX by retaliating against her. Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), leave to amend \"shall be freely given when justice so requires.\" The Court does not necessarily see the need for this amendment since the retaliation claim also falls under \u00a7 901 of Title IX and Plaintiff sufficiently pled facts in her initial complaint to put Defendant on notice of the retaliation claim. Furthermore, Defendant adequately addressed this retaliation argument in its motion for summary judgment. Defendant is not unduly prejudiced by Plaintiff\\'s failure to separately state her retaliation claim. Therefore, the Court sustains Plaintiff\\'s motion to amend her complaint to the extent this will help clear up the record.\\n[2]  Plaintiff actually alleges two separate theories of the underlying discrimination: sexual harassment and quid pro quo discrimination.\\n[3]  Summary judgment is appropriate where \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). \"At the summary judgment stage the judge\\'s function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter.\" Wiley v. U.S., 20 F.3d 222, 227 (6th Cir. 1994). The Court\\'s role is limited to determining if the evidence submitted viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party presents a sufficient disagreement about the material facts so that submission to trier of fact is necessary, or whether the evidence is so one-sided that a party must prevail as a matter of law. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202(1986). A dispute is genuine when \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\" Id. at 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505.\\n[4]  Johnson also says she worked very hard to get what Hendricks wanted, but suggests the KCHR was not quick to respond to her requests and ultimately generated a form letter stating the status of her complaint. When she again asked for a letter noting the proper date of her initial filing, Johnson says KCHR officials told her she was lucky to get anything since the KCHR typically did not provide any information on an individual request basis.\\n[5]  Although there is no direct link between hostile environment claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX, courts rely on Title VII law to analyze Title IX hostile environment claims. See, e.g., Franklin, 503 U.S. at 73-76, 112 S.Ct. 1028 (stating that the same rule should apply when a teacher sexually harasses a student as applies when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate under Title VII).\\n[6]  The Supreme Court has noted, \"whether gender-oriented conduct rises to the level of actionable harassment thus depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships, including, the ages of the harasser and the victim and the number of individuals involved.\" Davis, 526 U.S. at 629, 119 S.Ct. 1661. The Court notes that, while not determinative, the fact that Johnson was an older student in this case\\x97 thus making the age disparity between Wheat and herself quite different from that in the traditional teacher-student setting\\x97is relevant to the Court\\'s determination.\\n[7]  No one in this case disputes that Hendricks, as HIL\\'s President, was an official with the power to institute corrective measures.\\n[8]  The Court further notes that this holding is consistent with the overriding purpose of Gebser: to limit institutional liability to cases where the institution, as a recipient of federal funds, has actual knowledge of discrimination and fails to respond. In such cases, the Supreme Court reasoned, liability was proper because the institution was violating its duty not to discriminate as part of its implicit contract with the federal government. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 286, 118 S.Ct. 1989. Consequently then, as soon as an educational institution can be said to be on notice that discrimination is occurring, a decision not to remedy the situation amounts to a violation of this contract, whether or not the notice stems from the plaintiff-student or from every other student in the classroom, except the plaintiff-student.\\n[9]  One additional problem with the notice requirement in this case is that, even if HIL had notice of all of these events, it is not clear that this notice preceded Johnson\\'s alleged harassment.\\n[10]  At her deposition, Johnson testified that another student, Michele Slaughter told her that she complained to Hendricks after Wheat made the comment in class about the pain electrocution caused. According to Johnson, Slaughter claims she went to Wheat and said she hoped her complaining would not affect her grades. He allegedly told her, \"Well, I\\'ll plead amnesia this time, but don\\'t let it happen again.\" The Court recognizes at this stage that this is clearly hearsay and has not considered it for the truth of the matter asserted. However the Court notes it, because it suggests Johnson was on notice that Wheat was tougher on students who complained and that this general knowledge might have deterred her from complaining further to Hendricks. This could be damaging evidence at trial, if admissible. Of course at trial, the Court presumes, Slaughter herself would testify about her own encounters with Wheat and Hendricks.\\n[11]  As a preliminary matter the Court makes two determinations. First, courts are in agreement that there is no requirement that a plaintiff must prevail on any underlying claim of intentional discrimination in order to prevail on a claim of retaliation. Peters v. Jenney, 327 F.3d 307, 320-21 (4th Cir.2003) (discussing standard to apply in Title VI retaliation case where there no underlying claim remains); Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., 291 F.3d 1307, 1311-12 (11th Cir.2002) (discussing the standard to apply when there is no successful underlying claim in Title VII, ADA, and ADEA cases); Herron v. Harrison, 203 F.3d 410, 415 (6th Cir.2000) (noting in the prison inmate context, that the standard for judging whether a retaliation claim should proceed when the underlying claim is dismissed is whether that underlying claim was reasonable and not frivolous); Borgo v. Goldin, 204 F.3d 251 (D.C.Cir.2000) (analyzing Title VII retaliation case where underlying claims had been abandoned); Vadie v. Mississippi State Univ., 218 F.3d 365, 374 n. 24 (5th Cir.2000). The standard in all of these cases was whether the plaintiff had a good faith, reasonable basis for believing the underlying claim existed. In this case, based on the nature of Wheat\\'s comments in class as well as the fact that she apparently reasonably thought he failed her for not giving into his advances, the Court finds there was a subjective and objective basis for finding that she reasonably thought she was being harassed in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nSecond, this Court finds that Johnson has stated the prima facie elements for a retaliation claim. In Morris v. Oldham County Fiscal Court, 201 F.3d 784 (6th Cir.2000), the Sixth Circuit delineated the standard required to prove a claim for retaliation. Under that test, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) this exercise of protected rights was known to defendant; (3) defendant thereafter took adverse employment action against the plaintiff, or the plaintiff was subjected to severe or pervasive retaliatory harassment by a supervisor; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action or harassment. Id. at 792. In this case, Plaintiff has established a prima facie case based on these elements. She engaged in a protected activity when she lodged a complaint with KCHR. Arguably, HIL took adverse action in expelling her when it learned of her actions. Although good arguments can certainly be made that HIL\\'s actions were not pre-textual and were not based on the fact that she complained to KCHR, but instead stemmed from the fact it thought she lied to the Code of Conduct Board, these are credibility questions for a jury to assess.\\n[12]  The Court characterizes this as a circuit split because the Sandoval decision arose different views as to how to consider retaliation claims promulgated under Title VI and Title IX. Since Sandoval, the two circuit courts addressing this point have adopted their different positions under different statutes. That is, the Fourth Circuit in Peters v. Jenney, 327 F.3d 307, held that a Plaintiff can sue for retaliation under Title VI (the statute analyzed in Sandoval). In contrast, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the same claim does not lie under Title IX. Jackson v. Birmingham Board ofEduc, 309 F.3d 1333 (11th Cir.2002). Because Title VI and Title IX are to be read and interpreted consistent!}\\', the Court finds no reason to consider these opinions as doing anything other than adopting conflicting holdings on the same question.\\n\\nMoreover, the Eleventh Circuit\\'s opinion in Jackson is also in direct conflict with Frazier, 276 F.3d at 67 (setting the standard a student must meet to prevail on a Title IX retaliation claim), although Frazier made no mention of Sandoval, as well as numerous circuit court decisions announced prior to Sandoval which uniformly found or implied that Title IX gives private plaintiffs a cause of action to redress retaliation. See, e.g., Lowrey v. Texas A&amp;M University System, 117 F.3d 242 (5th Cir. 1997); Brine v. Univ. of Iowa, 90 F.3d 271, 272-73 (8th Cir. 1996); Murray v. N.Y. Univ.

The Department of Education has incorporated by reference \u00a7 100.7(e) and other regulations enforcing Title VI to enforce Title IX.

That right must come, if at all, from the independent force of \u00a7 602. As stated earlier, we assume for purposes of this decision that \u00a7 602 confers the authority to promulgate disparate-impact regulations; the question remains whether it confers a private right of action to enforce them. If not, we must conclude that a failure to comply with regulations promulgated under \u00a7 602 that is not also a failure to comply with \u00a7 601 is not actionable.\\nSandoval, 532 U.S. at 285, 121 S.Ct. 1511.\\n[18]  To answer this question, the Court examined \u00a7 902\\'s text for \"rights-creating language\" that would exhibit Congress\\'s intent to confer a private right of action for violations of all regulations promulgated thereunder.

INTRODUCTION\\nThe Court, having reviewed the briefs, supporting documentation and record in this case, as well as having heard the argument of counsel, hereby grants the plaintiff\\'s motions to remand these actions to state court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447.\\n\\nII. BACKGROUND\\nPlaintiff Precision Pay Phones (\"Plaintiff\") owns payphones and is a \"payphone service provider\" (\"PSP\"). PSPs generally receive compensation for use of their telephones in two ways. First, they collect coins directly deposited into their payphones. Illinois Public Telecommunications Ass\\'n v. F.C.C., 117 F.3d 555, 558-59 (D.C.Cir.1997). Second, they are compensated through contracts with particular \"interexchange carriers\" (\"IXC\"s) which provide long distance telephone communications services for e.g., collect calls or calls billed to a calling card or third party.[1]Id.\\nHowever, as to payphones calls utilizing access codes (800 numbers or 10XXX numbers that the caller uses to reach a desired long-distance carrier) and subscriber 800 numbers from which an IXC (with whom the PSP does not have a contract) derives revenues, independent PSPs receive no compensation from such calls. See id. at 559. IXCs utilize a \"dial-around\" system permitting the payphone user to make such calls without depositing coins or using the PSP\\'s contracted IXC. Id. \"Dial-around\" calls bypass the normal (or default) local and long distance services provided to the payphones. Upon receipt of a call from a payphone using a toll-free prefix, the call is routed through a LEC which accesses a database of all toll-free prefixed numbers, identifies the particular IXC and routes the call accordingly.\\nDefendant Qwest Communications Corporation (\"Defendant\") is an IXC. No express contact or agreement exists between Plaintiff and Defendant. Thus, no contractual provision was made between the parties regarding compensation for these \"dial-around\" calls made from Plaintiff\\'s payphones. There is no dispute, however, that Defendant obtains a financial benefit from these calls originating from Plaintiff\\'s payphones.\\nPreviously, PSPs could block callers\\' attempts to dial around a contracted IXC, but in 1990, Congress passed legislation prohibiting PSPs from blocking such calls. Id., citing, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 226(c)(1)(B). To promote competition among PSPs and to ensure that PSPs would get paid for use of their payphones for \"dial-around\" calls to non-contracted IXCs, Congress enacted Section 276 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Section 276 provided for establishment by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of \"a per call compensation plan to ensure that all payphone service providers are fairly compensated for each and every completed intrastate and interstate call using their payphone.\" 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 276(b)(1)(A).\\n*1110 Pursuant to that charge, the FCC established rules requiring that IXCs compensate PSPs for use of the payphones. Title 47 of Code of Federal Regulations, \u00a7 64.1300(a) provides that the \"first facilities-based interexchange carrier to which a completed coinless access code or subscriber toll-free payphone call is delivered by the local exchange carrier shall compensate the payphone service provider for the call at a rate agreed upon by the parties by contract.\" Additionally, \"[i]n absence of an agreement as required by paragraph (a) of this section, the carrier is obligated to compensate the payphone service provider at a per-call rate of $0.24.\" 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1300(c).\\nPlaintiff filed two separate, but similar, small-claims complaints against Defendant which differ only with regard to the time period and amounts claimed due. These complaints were filed in the Small Claims Division of the Superior Court of California in San Francisco County. Plaintiff seeks to recover compensation for Defendant\\'s \"dial-around\" calls originating from Plaintiff\\'s payphones. Plaintiff\\'s complaints consist of the following claim: \"Defendant owes me the sum of ($1,828.14 and $2,055.63, respectively), not including court costs, because: Underpayment of ... Dial Around Compensation.\" Small Claims Compl. No. 793996 \u00b6 1; Small Claims Compl. No. 793998 \u00b6 1.\\nOn January 11, 2002, Defendant removed these actions to federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1337, and 1441(b). On February 5, 2002, Plaintiff filed a motion to remand each case back to state court and the Court held argument on these motions on April 24, 2002.\\n\\nIII. ANALYSIS\\nAn action may be removed from state court if it is one over which the federal district courts has \"original jurisdiction.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). Defendant asserts there is federal question jurisdiction over Plaintiff\\'s claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 which confers jurisdiction over civil actions \"arising under\" federal law.\\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), the Court must remand a removed action where \"[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that [the Court] lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the case.\" \"Because of the Congressional purpose to restrict the jurisdiction of the federal courts on removal, the statute is strictly construed, and federal jurisdiction must be rejected if there is any doubt as to the right of removal in the first instance.\" Duncan v. Stuetzle, 76 F.3d 1480, 1485 (9th Cir.1996) (internal quotations omitted).\\nBecause Defendant opposes remanding these actions, it has the burden of establishing that removal was proper in the first place. Roskind v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Company, 165 F. Supp. 2d 1059, 1063 (N.D.Cal.2001), citing, Ethridge v. Harbor House Restaurant, 861 F.2d 1389, 1393 (9th Cir.1988). The issue here is whether Defendant has met this burden by demonstrating the Court\\'s original jurisdiction over Plaintiff\\'s claims.\\n\\nIV. WELL-PLEADED COMPLAINT RULE\\nThe determination of the existence of original jurisdiction of the district court (here based solely on federal question jurisdiction) is governed in the first instance by the \"well-pleaded complaint\" rule. \"[A] case `arises under\\' federal law within the meaning of the general federal question statute only if the federal question appears on the face of [the] plaintiff\\'s well-pleaded complaint; if not, original jurisdiction is lacking even if the defense is based on federal law.\" Hunter v. United *1111 Van Lines, 746 F.2d 635, 639 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 863, 106 S. Ct. 180, 88 L. Ed. 2d 150 (1985). Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the Court must look only to the face of the plaintiff\\'s complaint to determine whether the plaintiff has presented a federal question. See Franchise Tax Board of State of California v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern California, 463 U.S. 1, 9-10, 103 S. Ct. 2841, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1983) (\"Franchise Tax Board\"). The plaintiff is the master of his case and may ignore federal claims and assert only state claims, and thus defeat removal. Duncan, 76 F.3d at 1485. Federal question jurisdiction may not be sustained on a theory that the plaintiff has not advanced. See Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 809 n. 9, 106 S. Ct. 3229, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650 (1986); see also Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U.S. 74, 75-76, 34 S. Ct. 724, 58 L. Ed. 1218 (1914) (noting that a well-pleaded complaint for the purposes of conferring \"arising under\" jurisdiction is one where the court considers only what necessarily appears in the plaintiff\\'s statement or claim, unaided by anything alleged in anticipation or avoidance or defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose). Moreover, a case may not be removed to federal court solely on the basis of a federal defense. See Caterpillar, Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392, 107 S. Ct. 2425, 96 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1987).\\nThus, the general rule in situations where removal is based on federal question jurisdiction is that, unless a federal claim appears on the face of a well-pleaded complaint, removal is improper. Redwood Theatres v. Festival Enterprises, Inc., 908 F.2d 477, 479 (9th Cir.1990); see Taylor v. Sun Reporter Publ\\'g Co., No. C98-2044 VRW, 1999 WL 782393, *1 (N.D.Cal. Sept.29, 1999) (remanding a case to state court where a small claims court complaint did not allege on its face any federal cause of action or any other reference to federal law).\\nHere, Plaintiff\\'s small claims complaints simply contain boilerplate language typical of small claims actions. Plaintiff asserts, inter alia, that \"Defendant owes me the sum of ($1,828.14 and $2,055.63, respectively), not including court costs, because: Underpayment of ... Dial Around Compensation.\" Small Claims Compl. No. 793996 \u00b6 1; Small Claims Compl. No. 793998 \u00b6 1. The complaints further assert that Plaintiff requested payment and Defendant refused to pay. Small Claims Compl. No. 793996 \u00b6 3; Small Claims Compl. No. 793998 \u00b6 3. Plaintiff does not indicate the precise legal basis for this claim, but Plaintiff is not required to do so because of the \"non-technical\" nature of the small claims court complaint form. Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 116.320(b) (West 2002). The simple pleading requirements, not requiring any additional argument or articulation of legal theory for compensation, is consistent with the small claims court organic statute. Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 116.120(b) (West 2002) (\"[i]n order to resolve minor civil disputes expeditiously, inexpensively, and fairly, it is essential to provide a judicial forum accessible to all parties directly involved in resolving these disputes\").\\nThere is nothing on the face of these complaints that asserts a federal claim. In support of its motion for remand, Plaintiff contends that its claims are common counts for quantum meruit or assumpsit. The general pleading of Plaintiff\\'s small claims complaints is consistent with a common count pleading practice. Moreover, the California case law supports Plaintiff\\'s equitable claims for quantum meruit.\\nUnder California law, quantum meruit is \"an equitable remedy implied by the law under which a plaintiff who has rendered services benefitting the defendant may recover the reasonable value of those *1112 services when necessary to prevent unjust enrichment of the defendant.\" In re De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, Inc., 963 F.2d 1269, 1272 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, Carolco Television, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., Inc., 506 U.S. 918, 113 S. Ct. 330, 121 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1992), citing, B. Witkin, Summary of California Law: Contracts \u00a7 91 (1987) and 55 Cal. Jur.3d Restitution 360-61 (1980); see Hahn v. Oregon Physicians\\' Serv., 786 F.2d 1353, 1355 (9th Cir.1985) (applying Oregon law noting that \"[t]he purpose of quantum meruit is to prevent unjust enrichment at the expense of another\"); Arrison v. Information Resources, Inc., No. C95-3554 THE, 1999 WL 551232, *6 (N.D.Cal. July 16, 1999) (\"[t]he underlying idea behind quantum meruit is the law\\'s distaste for unjust enrichment\"). Where a party has received a benefit which the party may not justly retain and the parties have no actual express contract covering compensation, for reasons of justice the law will imply a contract to pay for services rendered. See Iverson, Yoakum, Papiano &amp; Hatch v. Berwald, 76 Cal. App. 4th 990, 996, 90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 665 (1999); Maglica v. Maglica, 66 Cal. App. 4th 442, 449, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 101 (1998).\\nTo establish a claim for quantum meruit, the plaintiff must prove that: [1] the plaintiff rendered services to the defendant\\'s benefit; and [2] the defendant would be unjustly enriched if the plaintiff was not compensated. Arrison, 1999 WL 551232, at *6, citing, De Laurentiis, 963 F.2d at 1272. The claim applies especially where the defendant acquires the benefit with knowledge of the circumstances establishing unjust enrichment. First Nationwide Savings v. Perry, 11 Cal. App. 4th 1657, 1663-64, 15 Cal. Rptr. 2d 173 (1992). The plaintiff and a defendant need not be in contractual privity with each other; the plaintiff may recover on a quantum meruit theory from any other party even though no express or implied contractual relationship exists. See De Laurentiis, 963 F.2d at 1273, citing, Kossian v. American National Ins. Co., 254 Cal. App. 2d 647, 649-50, 62 Cal. Rptr. 225 (1967) (allowing recovery under quantum meruit where no implied contact existed and the plaintiff did not expect compensation from the current defendant, but a third-party). A defendant\\'s expectation to compensate for a received benefit is not necessary, but compensation must be \"expected\" by a plaintiff \"only in the sense that the services rendered must not have been intended to be gratuitous.\" Id. at 1272-73.\\nThe criteria for quantum meruit are facially satisfied here. To the extent \"dial-around\" calls are made through Defendant\\'s network from Plaintiff\\'s payphones, Defendant obtains the benefit of Plaintiff\\'s services without paying for them. While Defendant has the option of blocking calls from Plaintiff\\'s payphones over Defendant\\'s network, Defendant has chosen to receive \"dial-around\" calls from Plaintiff\\'s payphones. Thus, it has acquired benefits conferred by Plaintiff with full knowledge of the circumstances. Plaintiff\\'s income depends on compensation from its payphones. The services rendered to Defendant were not intended to be gratuitous, as evidenced by the invoices Plaintiff has sent to Defendant. Plaintiff\\'s Mot. for Remand, p. 6, ln. 3-4. Defendant would be unjustly enriched if it paid Plaintiff nothing out of the compensation it received for dial-around calls which were made possible by the use of Plaintiff\\'s payphones.\\nThe small claims here asserts a facially valid claim for quantum meruit.\\n\\nV. ARTFUL PLEADING AND SUBSTANTIAL FEDERAL QUESTION DOCTRINES\\nThere are limited circumstances in which the Court can delve beyond the face of the state court complaint and find federal question jurisdiction. Under *1113 the \"artful pleading\" doctrine, the court under some circumstances may recharacterize a plaintiff\\'s state law claim as a federal claim. Hunter, 746 F.2d at 640. However, the doctrine is to be invoked \"only in exceptional circumstances,\" Salveson v. Western States Bankcard Association, 731 F.2d 1423, 1427 (9th Cir.1984), and such recharacterization is proper where federal law: (1) completely preempts state law and (2) confers a federal remedy. ARCO Environmental Remediation, LLC v. Dept. of Health and Environmental Quality of Montana, 213 F.3d 1108, 1114 (9th Cir.2000); Utley v. Varian Associates, Inc., 811 F.2d 1279, 1287 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 824, 108 S. Ct. 89, 98 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1987); Hunter, 746 F.2d at 642-44.\\nMoreover, a claim which facially appears to be based on state law may be deemed to \"arise under\" federal law where \"some substantial, disputed question of federal law is a necessary element of one of the well pleaded state claims....\" Franchise Tax Board, 463 U.S. at 13, 103 S. Ct. 2841; Rains v. Criterion Systems, Inc., 80 F.3d 339, 345 (9th Cir.1996); ARCO Environmental, 213 F.3d at 1116;[2]Utley, 811 F.2d at 1283.\\nThe existence vel non of a private right of action informs the applicability of both exceptions to the well-pleaded complaint rule. In the context of complete pre-emption, the Ninth Circuit has held that \"the artful pleading doctrine applies only when federal law not only displaces state law but also confers a federal remedy.\" Hunter, 746 F.2d at 642. If there is no federal cause of action, \"recharacterization of the plaintiff\\'s state law claim as a federal claim is doctrinally impossible.\" Utley, 811 F.2d at 1287. Under the substantial federal question doctrine, the absence of a federal right of action implies the federal element is \"insufficiently `substantial\\' to confer federal-question jurisdiction.\" Merrell Dow, 478 U.S. at 814, 106 S. Ct. 3229, cited in, Rains, 80 F.3d at 347 n. 10. The rationale in Merrell Dow is that \"to permit removal based on a federal statute not conferring a private right of action would disregard the will of Congress to preclude a private remedy in federal court for the statute\\'s violation.\" Utley, 811 F.2d at 1283.\\n\\nA. Private Right of Action\\n\\nThus, as a threshold matter the Court must address whether there is a private right of action to compel the payment of dial-around compensation provided by 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1300(a) and authorized by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 276(b)(1)(A). Lower courts are split on this question.[3]\\n*1114 While the issue is debatable, the Court concludes that PSPs may bring a private right of action against IXCs to collect dial-around compensation. The starting point is authorizing statute which mandates compensation to PSPs, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 276(b)(1). As noted above, the statute explicitly directs the FCC to prescribe regulations to establish a per call compensation plan \"to ensure that all payphone service providers are fairly compensated for each and every completed intrastate and interstate call using their payphone.\" 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 276(b)(1)(A). The statute was intended to address, inter alia, the difficulty PSPs had in recovering compensation from IXCs for dial-around calls. Illinois Public Telecommunications, 117 F.3d at 558-59.\\nWhile \u00a7 276 does not address enforcement through a private right of action, \u00a7 207 of the same chapter does. Section 207 provides:\\n\"Any person claiming to be damaged by any common carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter may either make complaint to the Commission ... or may bring suit for the recovery of the damages for which such common carrier may be liable under the provisions of this chapter, in any district court of the United States ...\"\\nMoreover, \u00a7 206 provides:\\nIn case any common carrier shall do, or cause or permit to be done, any act, matter, or thing in this chapter prohibited or declared to be unlawful, or shall omit to do any act, matter, or thing in this chapter required to be done, such common carrier shall be liable to the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of any such violation of the provisions of this chapter, together with a reasonable counsel or attorney\\'s fee, to be fixed by the court in every case of recovery, which attorney\\'s fee shall be taxed and collected as part of the costs in the case.\\nThus, \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207 permit suits in federal court to enforce rights under \u00a7 276.\\nDefendant argues that the private right of action conferred by \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207 applies only to enforcement of the Telecommunications Act itself and not the regulations promulgated thereunder. While some district courts have so concluded,[4] the Supreme Court\\'s recent decision in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 121 S. Ct. 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517 (2001) compels a contrary result. In Alexander, the Court addressed the question whether there was a private right of action to enforce regulations promulgated under \u00a7 602 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Section 601 of Title VI prohibits recipients of federal funds from engaging in racial or national origin discrimination. Section 601 has been interpreted to prohibit only intentional discrimination. Section 601 has also been interpreted to provide a private right of action. Section 602 of Title VI authorizes federal agencies to promulgate regulations to effectuate \u00a7 601. The regulations at issue in Alexander, promulgated under \u00a7 602, prohibit recipients of federal funds from engaging facially neutral practices which have a disparate impact, thus going beyond the substantive provisions of \u00a7 601 which reaches only intentional discrimination. The Court held that the disparate impact regulations under \u00a7 602 could not be enforced by a private right of *1115 action. Alexander, 532 U.S. at 282, 121 S. Ct. 1511. While the Alexander Court refused to imply a private right to enforce the disparate impact regulations, its analysis compels a contrary result here for several reasons.\\nFirst, in contrast to the disparate impact regulations of \u00a7 602, the Court held that the private right of action to enforce \u00a7 601\\'s prohibition on intentional discrimination did apply equally to regulations applying \u00a7 601\\'s ban on intentional discrimination. Id. at 284, 121 S. Ct. 1511. Because those regulations did not substantively expand \u00a7 601 but simply interpreted and implemented it, the Court stated \"it is therefore meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the statute.\" Id. The same is true with 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 276(b)(1)(A) and 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1300(a). The Telecommunications Act mandates that PSPs be \"fairly compensated\" and directs the FCC to establish the per call compensation plan. Title 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1300(a) implements the Congressional mandate embodied in the statute through powers expressly delegated to the FCC.[5] As with the \u00a7 601 regulation in Alexander, these FCC regulations contrast with the \u00a7 602 disparate impact which did not simply fill in interstices left by the statute, but created a substantive standard which differed from the statute. Like the \u00a7 601 intentional discrimination regulations, \"it is meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce\" the FCC regulation at 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1300 apart its authorizing statute, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 276(b)(1)(A). A suit to enforce the right of PSPs under \u00a7 276(b)(1)(A) to be \"fairly compensated\" would be meaningless without the FCC regulation which specifies the precise level of that compensation. Accordingly, Alexander, the right of action conferred under \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207 applies not only to the Telecommunications Act, but to implementing the FCC regulations as well.\\nSecond, even if the FCC regulation were deemed a separate and independent regulation for which a separate private right of action must be found, the analytical framework of Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 95 S. Ct. 2080, 45 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1975), suggests it would be appropriate to find such a right here. The touchstone to this determination is the text of the statute and Congress\\' intent. Alexander, 532 U.S. at 288, 121 S. Ct. 1511. In contrast to \u00a7 602 of Title VI which contained no \"rights-creating language\" and did not focus on the individuals protected\\x97focusing instead solely on the agencies that did the regulating \\x97 \u00a7 276(b)(1) mandates that PSPs be \"fairly compensated\" under a per-call compensation plan to be devised by the FCC. It creates a right to fair compensation and focuses specifically on the individuals to be protected \\x97 \"all payphone service providers.\" Moreover, whereas \u00a7 602 of Title VI specified only agency enforcement and contained \"elaborate restrictions\" thereon which suggested that Congress intended to provide only one method of enforcement (administrative) to the preclusion of others (private suits), \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207 expressly provide for enforcement through private suits filed in federal court as well as through administrative petitions filed with the FCC. Thus, there is nothing from the structure or purpose of the statute which would indicate a legislative intent to preclude a private right of action.\\nFor these reasons, the Court concludes that PSPs may bring a federal suit to enforce their compensation rights for dial-around calls against IXCs.[6]\\n\\n\\n*1116 B. Complete Preemption\\n\\nNotwithstanding the Court finding of a private right of action, the \"artful pleading\" doctrine requires an additional element that is missing here \\x97 \"complete preemption\" by federal law. As noted above, federal defenses to a state claim does not create \"arising under\" jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331. Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 392, 107 S. Ct. 2425. That applies to traditional preemption defenses. Toumajian v. Frailey, 135 F.3d 648, 655 (9th Cir.1998). Federal jurisdiction is created only where there is \"complete preemption\" \\x97 \"the rare instances where Congress has chosen to regulate the entire field.\" ARCO Environmental, 213 F.3d at 1114. In those contexts, \"the preemptive force of a statute is so `extraordinary\\' that it `converts an ordinary state common-law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule.\\'\" Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 393, 107 S. Ct. 2425, quoting Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 65, 107 S. Ct. 1542, 95 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1987). The Court has found such complete preemption in the context of \u00a7 301 of the Labor Relations Management Act (LMRA), codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, and certain portions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). See Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, International Assn\\' of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 390 U.S. 557, 560, 88 S. Ct. 1235, 20 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1968) (LMRA); Metropolitan Life, 481 U.S. at 63-64, 107 S. Ct. 1542 (ERISA). There is no \"complete preemption\" where the federal law only preempts state law inconsistent with it. Rains, 80 F.3d at 345 (determining that Title VII only preempts inconsistent state law and does not completely preempt state law).\\nWhile \"[t]here does not appear to be any Ninth Circuit authority finding that the [Telecommunications Act] either does or does not `completely preempt\\' state law claims ... the weight of authority, as well as more consistent reasoning, supports a finding that it does not.\" Braco v. MCI Worldcom Communications, Inc., 138 F. Supp. 2d 1260, 1269 (C.D.Cal.2001); see Heichman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 943 F. Supp. 1212, 1222 (C.D.Cal.1995) (finding that the Telecommunications Act did not transform the plaintiff\\'s state law causes of action into a federal cause of action); Boyle v. MTV Networks, 766 F. Supp. 809, 816 (N.D.Cal.1991) (finding that neither the Telecommunications Act\\'s statutory language nor its legislative history supports the proposition that Congress intended complete preemption); see Quayle v. MCI Worldcom., Inc., No. C00-3694 SC, 2001 WL 1329594, **2-3 (N.D.Cal. Oct.22, 2001).\\nThe Court concludes, the Telecommunications Act does not have the necessary preemptive force to warrant complete preemption. The crucial provision is 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 276(c) which provides, \"[t]o the extent that any State requirements are inconsistent with the Commission\\'s regulations, the Commission\\'s regulations on such matters shall preempt such State requirements.\" As with Title VII, preemption is limited to inconsistent state law.[7] Thus, Rains, supra, is dispositive \\x97 there is no \"complete preemption.\" That conclusion *1117 is bolstered by the fact that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 414 contains a savings clause which provides that \"[n]othing in this chapter contained shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.\" Clearly, \u00a7 414 is intended to preserve state law to the extent feasible. Thus, while the \u00a7 276(b)(1)(A) of the Telecommunications Act may be enforced by a suit in federal court, there is nothing to suggest Congress intended this mode of enforcement to be to the exclusion of claims in state courts. As demonstrated by the limited scope of the preemption provision of \u00a7 276(c) and the savings clause of \u00a7 414, state court enforcement was not of such \"central concern to the federal statute,\" Franchise Tax Board, 463 U.S. at 25-26, 103 S. Ct. 2841, so as to evince Congress\\' intent to completely displace state court jurisdiction over suits to collect dial-around compensation.\\nAccordingly, the \"artful pleading\" doctrine requiring \"complete preemption\" does not apply.\\n\\nC. Substantial Federal Question\\n\\nEven where state law creates the plaintiff\\'s cause of action, the case may be deemed to \"arise under\" federal law \"if the right to relief under\" state law \"requires resolution of a substantial question of federal law in dispute between the parties.\" Franchise Tax Board, 463 U.S. at 13, 103 S. Ct. 2841; see ARCO Environmental, 213 F.3d at 1116; Rains, 80 F.3d at 345. The existence of a requisite \"substantial federal question\" has proven elusive to a bright line determination due in part to the fact that \"the phrase `arising under\\' masks a welter of issues regarding the interrelation of federal and state authority and the proper management of the federal judicial system.\" Franchise Tax Board, 463 U.S. at 8, 103 S. Ct. 2841.\\nExamination of a substantial federal question has arisen in a variety of contexts in which state and federal law are intermingled. See, e.g., Merrell Dow, supra (violation of Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act alleged to constitute rebuttable presumption of negligence); Franchise Tax Board, supra (state sought to levy against money held in retirement trust fund regulated by ERISA); Moore v. Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry. Co., 291 U.S. 205, 54 S. Ct. 402, 78 L. Ed. 755 (1934) (state law limited defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk where employer violated FELA); Rains, supra (Title VII asserted as public policy in claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy); Hunter, supra (state law bad faith claim required colorable contract claim based on federal law). As these cases illustrate, the fact that a case may turn in part upon the resolution of some issue of federal law or that federal law constitutes an ingredient of the state law claim for relief does not automatically convert a state claim into one \"arising under\" federal law for purposes of federal question jurisdiction. Rather, the court must examine the centrality of the federal law to the claim and consider policy factors. \"What is needed is something of that commonsense accommodation of judgment to kaleidoscopic situations which characterizes the *1118 law in its treatment of causation ... a selective process which picks the substantial causes our of the web and lays the other ones aside.\" Franchise Tax Board, 463 U.S. at 20, 103 S. Ct. 2841, quoting, Gully v. First National Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 117-18, 57 S. Ct. 96, 81 L. Ed. 70 (1936).\\nThe evaluation of the importance of the federal issue to the state claim has been stated variously. As discussed in Hunter, supra, courts have stated that the federal element in a claim must be \"direct and essential as opposed to attenuated,\" \"basic as opposed to collateral,\" \"necessary as opposed to merely possible,\" \"pivotal,\" \"substantial as opposed to merely incidental\" or \"paramount as opposed to collateral.\" Hunter, 746 F.2d at 646 (internal quotations omitted). The fact that the state claim \"hinges on\" federal law is not, in and of itself, sufficient. Id. at 645-46. In Hunter, the court held that the fact that the federal element determined as a preliminary matter whether the state law duty of good faith applied was insufficient. Id. at 646. Just as the creation property rights through federal land patents, trademarks and copyrights has been held not to transform state law actions to enforce contract and property rights into federal claims, the federal element in Hunter (contract claim based on federal law) was deemed to be involved only \"incidentally;\" the bad faith count \"fundamentally asserts [state] claims.\" Id. at 647 (quotations omitted). Similarly, in Moore, supra, and Merrell Dow, supra, \"the violation of the federal standard as an element of state tort recovery did not fundamentally change the state tort nature of the action.\" Merrell Dow, 478 U.S. at 814 n. 12, 106 S. Ct. 3229, citing, Moore, 291 U.S. at 216-17, 54 S. Ct. 402.\\nIn the case at bar, the state claim for quantum meruit exists independent of the right of action under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 276(b)(1)(A). The only involvement of federal law is the FCC regulation (47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1300(c)) which sets the default per call compensation level in the absence of a contractual agreement between the PSP and the IXC. The establishment of a default per call rate touches the state claim \"at a single point,\" Moore, 291 U.S. at 216, 54 S. Ct. 402, and does not \"fundamentally change\" the nature of the state law equitable claim asserted by Plaintiff herein. Had the FCC regulation not set a default rate, Plaintiff would be free to prove under state law the value of the service provided to, and which benefitted, Defendant.\\nFinally, considerations of policy and common sense further counsel against finding federal jurisdiction over Plaintiff\\'s small claims counts. \"[D]eterminations about federal jurisdiction require sensitive judgments about congressional intent, judicial power, and the federal system.\" Merrell Dow, 478 U.S. at 810, 106 S. Ct. 3229. The analysis must be informed by \"the demands of reason and coherence, and the dictates of sound judicial policy.\" Id. The cases at bar were initiated by a small independent PSP as a pro se small claims suit to collect $1,828.14 and $2,055.63. The effect of the removal petition filed by Defendant (apparently not an isolated tactic among IXCs as indicated by the number of other similar cases which have addressed removal jurisdiction) is to haul the small claims plaintiff into federal court, turning a simple collection suit into a federal case which is far more costly and complicated to litigate.[8] Nothing in the *1119 letter of the Telecommunications Act, FCC regulations at issue, or legislative history indicates that the federal law designed to help independent PSPs recover fair compensation is to be construed in such a manner as to deprive them of their choice of the most efficient and appropriate forum. Indeed, permitting removal to federal court over the objections of independent PSPs as Plaintiff in the instant cases would, if anything, contravene the legislative purpose of \u00a7 276(b)(1)(A).\\nMoreover, this case does not require the \"resolution of a substantial, disputed federal question.\" ARCO Environmental, 213 F.3d at 1114. The federal ingredient involved here \\x97 the setting of the per call dial-around rate in the absence of a contract \\x97 requires no interpretation of federal law.[9] Hence, there is no compelling need for a federal forum to e.g. facilitate national uniformity in the interpretation or application of federal law. Cf. Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 457, 77 S. Ct. 912, 1 L. Ed. 2d 972 (1957) (determining that uniform federal law and policy should be applied under the LMRA). Nor is there any reason to expect that federal courts possess greater expertise than state courts in applying the dial-around rate set by FCC regulation.\\nIn short, the Court \"cannot identify any compelling reasons of federal judicial policy for embracing a case of this kind as a federal question case.... [The California Superior Courts] are fully competent\" to apply the applicable federal law here. Merrell Dow, 478 U.S. at 814, 106 S. Ct. 3229, quoting, Kravitz v. Homeowners Warranty Corp., 542 F. Supp. 317, 319 (E.D.Pa.1982).\\n\\nVI. CONCLUSION\\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff\\'s claims in the cases at bar do not give rise to federal jurisdiction of this Court. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff\\'s motions to remand. The above-captioned cases are hereby remanded to the Superior Court for San Francisco, Small Claims Division.\\nHowever, on May 30, 2002, Defendant filed a Motion for Transfer, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407, before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. As such, this Order is hereby stayed pending the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation\\'s ruling on the motion.\\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Competing against independent PSPs like Plaintiff are local exchange carriers (\"LEC\"s) which have local networks able to receive subsidies for common line charges that LECs assess IXCs for originating and terminating long-distance calls. Illinois Public Telecommunications, 117 F.3d at 559.\\n[2]  In ARCO Environmental, supra, the Ninth Circuit also stated as an additional basis for federal jurisdiction in cases \"where the claim is necessarily federal in character.\" ARCO Environmental, 213 F.3d at 1114, citing, Brennan v. Southwest Airlines Co., 134 F.3d 1405, 1409 (9th Cir.), amended by, 140 F.3d 849 (9th Cir.1998). Brennan involved application of the artful pleading doctrine where \"the defendant has a federal preemption defense to a state claim and federal law provides a remedy.\" Brennan, 134 F.3d at 1409 (citation omitted). It thus appears indistinguishable from the \"complete preemption\" doctrine.\\n[3]  Both parties have submitted as exhibits a number of unpublished district court decisions on this issue. Although these decisions lack precedential effect, the Court recognizes that trial courts are widely split on this issue. Compare Wolfe v. Global Crossing Telecomm., Inc., CV 01-0881, 882, 883 TJH; CV 01-03454 TJH (C.D.Cal. July 25, 2001) (private rights of action); Wolfe v. Qwest Communications Corp., CV 01-05554, 05555, 05556, 05557(TJH) (C.D. Cal Dec. 17, 2001) (accord); PBS Telecom, Inc. v. Qwest Communications Corp., No. CV01-7285 RMT (C.D.Cal. Jan. 16, 2002) (accord); and Bay Dist. Service, Inc. v. Qwest Communications Corp., No. C01-20940 RMW (N.D.Cal. Jan. 29, 2002) (accord), with Precision Pay Phones v. Global Crossing Telecomm., Inc., No. C01-02901 WHA, 2001 WL 1456766, *1 (N.D.Cal. Nov.6, 2001) (no private right of action) and Precision Pay Phones v. Qwest Communications Corp., C02-00201 SBA (N.D.Cal. May 16, 2002) (accord).\\n[4]  See, e.g., Precision Pay Phones v. Global Crossing Telecomm., Inc., 2001 WL 1456766, at *1; Precision Pay Phones v. Qwest Communications Corp., C02-00201 SBA (N.D.Cal. May 16, 2002) (unpublished court order); cf. Conboy v. AT &amp; T Corp., 84 F. Supp. 2d 492, 500 (S.D.N.Y.2000).\\n[5]  Regulations promulgated pursuant to an express delegation of authority by the legislature have traditionally warranted the highest level of judicial deference. See 1 Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 6.4, at 329-31 (4th ed.2002).\\n[6]  The analysis applicable under Alexander, supra, does not necessarily imply that all FCC regulations promulgated under the Telecommunications Act are enforceable by private suits. Alexander requires an examination into the nature of the relationship between the regulation in question and the authorizing statute. Alexander, 532 U.S. at 284, 121 S. Ct. 1511. If there is a meaningful distinction such that the right to enforce the regulation warrants separate analysis from enforcement of the statute, then a court must apply the Cort v. Ash, supra, analysis to the regulation. Because each regulation must be examined separately, this Court\\'s conclusion is not necessarily inconsistent with Conboy, supra, which involved different FCC regulations.\\n[7]  This language is parallel to the narrower branch of traditional preemption recognized by the courts \\x97 \"conflict preemption\" \\x97 where \"compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\" Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142-43, 83 S. Ct. 1210, 10 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1963), or where state law \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\" Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S. Ct. 399, 85 L. Ed. 581 (1941). This narrow branch of preemption contrasts with \"field preemption\" where Congress intends federal law to \"occupy the field\" to the general exclusion of state law. Crosby v. Nat\\'l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 372, 120 S. Ct. 2288, 147 L. Ed. 2d 352 (2000); see English v. General Electric Co., 496 U.S. 72, 79, 110 S. Ct. 2270, 110 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1990).\\n[8]  The facts of this case illustrate how removal can represent a costly trap for the unwary. Defendant objected to the appearance of Joe Lisha before the Court pro se, because his business, Precision Pay Phones, was a partnership which cannot appear before the Court without counsel. See Civil L.R. 3-9(b) (stating that corporations, unincorporated associations, partnerships, etc., \"may appear only through a member of the bar of the Court\"). Lisha was then compelled to represent he would restructure Precision Pay Phones into a sole proprietorship. Defendant accepted Lisha\\'s representation as did the Court. Only with acceptance of that business change was Lisha permitted to proceed pro se. See National Independent Theatre Exhibitors, Inc. v. Buena Vista Distribution Co., 748 F.2d 602, 609-10 (11th Cir.1984) (noting that pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654, a sole proprietor could appear in federal court pro se).\\n[9]  Certainly, there is no basis for presuming that every collection suit in state court in which the price or rate is affected by some federal regulation gives rise to a federal question.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 2579657}]"},{"id":701378,"date_filed":"1995-08-30","judges":"Anderson, Birch, Black, Carnes, Cox, Dubina, Edmondson, Hatchett, Kravitch, Tjoflat","case_name_full":"Becky WALLACE, Plaintiff, Annette Neal, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.

Nashville Banner Publishing Co.,3 applies to cases brought under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.  We also hold that the reasoning underlying McKennon applies with equal force when the after-acquired evidence concerns an employee\\'s fraud in the application process, rather than an employee\\'s wrongful conduct during employment.\\n    \\n    I. Background\\n    \\n      2\\n      Appellee Joyce Annette Neal filed suit against Dunn Construction Company, Inc.  (\"Dunn\"), alleging that:  (1) she was not paid the same as her male coworkers,4 in violation of the Equal Pay Act, (2) she was subject to retaliatory discharge in violation of the Equal Pay Act, (3) she was sexually harassed in violation of Title VII, and (4) she was subject to retaliatory discharge in violation of Title VII.  Neal also raised Alabama state law claims for assault and battery and invasion of privacy.  During one of Neal\\'s depositions, Dunn learned that Neal had pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana and cocaine in state court in 1987.  In her job application, filled out on April 13, 1988, however, Neal had answered \"no\" to the question, \"Have you ever been convicted of a crime?\"\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Dunn moved for partial summary judgment on the federal claims contending, inter alia, that Dunn \"discovered that [Neal] falsified her employment application and that she has violated company policy against convictions for drug offenses which are legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for which she would have been terminated in any event, without regard to sex or retaliation.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      The district court denied summary judgment, noting that the Eleventh Circuit had never held that after-acquired evidence bars recovery in a discrimination case.  Neal and Dunn jointly filed a motion to certify the order denying Dunn\\'s motion for partial summary judgment for an interlocutory appeal.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b).  The district court granted the motion and a panel of this court granted Dunn permission to appeal.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      In Wallace v. Dunn Constr.  Co., 968 F.2d 1174 (11th Cir.1992), a panel of this court addressed the effect of after-acquired evidence of an employee\\'s fraud in a job application and in a split decision, affirmed the denial of summary judgment.  We granted Dunn\\'s suggestion for rehearing en banc, vacating the panel opinion.  Wallace v. Dunn Constr.  Co., 32 F.3d 1489 (11th Cir.1994).  During the pendency of the en banc proceedings, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in McKennon.\\n    \\n    II. McKennon\\n    \\n      6\\n      In McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., --- U.S. ----, 115 S. Ct. 879, 130 L. Ed. 2d 852 (1995), a case involving an alleged violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\"), the Supreme Court held that after-acquired evidence of wrongful conduct during employment that would have resulted in termination does not \"operate[ ], in every instance, to bar all relief for an earlier violation of the Act.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 884.   The Court held, however, that \"the after-acquired evidence of the employee\\'s wrongdoing bears on the specific remedy to be ordered.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 885.   The Court determined that in cases in which an employee commits an act during employment that would lead to termination and the employer finds out about the act during the course of litigation, \"neither reinstatement nor front pay is an appropriate remedy.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 886.   The Court then discussed backpay, holding that it should be calculated \"from the date of the unlawful discharge to the date the new information was discovered,\" with the court \"taking into further account extraordinary equitable circumstances that affect the legitimate interests of either party.\"  Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      Our task today is to determine the impact of McKennon when an employee who has falsified her job application brings a lawsuit under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.\\n    \\n    III. Title VII and The Equal Pay Act\\n    \\n      8\\n      At the outset, we must determine whether the Supreme Court\\'s decision in McKennon applies to actions brought pursuant to Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.  The Supreme Court noted in McKennon that the ADEA, Title VII, and the Equal Pay Act all are \"part of a wider statutory scheme to protect employees in the workplace nationwide.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 884.   All three statutes share \"a common purpose:  \\'the elimination of discrimination in the work place.\\' \"  McKennon, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S. Ct. at 884 (referring to Title VII and the ADEA) (quoting Oscar Mayer &amp; Co. v. Evans, 441 U.S. 750, 756, 99 S. Ct. 2066, 2071, 60 L. Ed. 2d 609 (1979));  see also Miranda v. B &amp; B Cash Grocery Store, Inc., 975 F.2d 1518, 1527 (11th Cir.1992) (\"Title VII and the Equal Pay Act exist side by side in an effort to rid the workforce of gender-based discrimination.\").  Additionally, the ADEA and Title VII share common substantive features, and the ADEA and the Equal Pay Act share common remedial provisions.  McKennon, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S. Ct. at 884.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      Based upon the similarities among the statutes, we conclude that the holding of McKennon is applicable to claims brought under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.  See O\\'Driscoll v. Hercules Inc., 52 F.3d 294 (10th Cir.1995) (remanding ADEA, Title VII and Fair Labor Standards Act claims to district court for reconsideration in light of McKennon );  Wehr v. Ryan\\'s Family Steak Houses, Inc., 49 F.3d 1150, 1153 (6th Cir.1995) (\"While McKennon involved an ADEA claim, we are persuaded by its language that it applies equally to a Title VII claim.\");  Manard v. Fort Howard Corp., 47 F.3d 1067, 1067 (10th Cir.1995) (applying McKennon, without discussion, to Title VII case).\\n    \\n    IV. Fraud in a Job Application\\n    \\n      10\\n      Dunn argues that McKennon is not applicable to this case because the petitioner in McKennon had committed wrongful acts during employment, whereas Neal lied on her job application.  Dunn urges the conclusion that \"one who obtains a job or employment contract by misrepresentation has no employment contract, no employee status and no standing to sue for alleged employment-related wrongs.\"   We cannot agree.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Title VII and the Equal Pay Act, like the ADEA, serve to deter discriminatory conduct in the workplace and to compensate for injuries caused by the prohibited discrimination.5  Each of these statutes thus \"grants an injured employee a right of action to obtain the authorized relief.\"  McKennon, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S. Ct. at 884;  see also 29 U.S.C. Sec. 216(b) (authorizing private actions under the Equal Pay Act);  29 U.S.C. Sec. 626(c) (authorizing private actions under the ADEA);  42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(f)(1) (authorizing private right of action under Title VII).  Moreover, \"[t]he private litigant who seeks redress for his or her injuries vindicates both the deterrence and the compensation objectives of the [Acts].\" McKennon, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S. Ct. at 884.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      In McKennon, the Supreme Court explained that these twin objectives of the ADEA would not be served if an employer were free to discriminate against an employee merely because the employer learned of that employee\\'s wrongdoing:\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      The objectives of [ADEA] are furthered when even a single employee establishes that an employer has discriminated against him or her.  The disclosure through litigation of incidents or practices which violate national policies respecting nondiscrimination in the work force is itself important, for the occurrence of violations may disclose patterns of noncompliance resulting from a misappreciation of the Act\\'s operation or entrenched resistance to its commands, either of which can be of industry-wide significance.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      McKennon, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S. Ct. at 885.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      Likewise, the objectives of deterrence and compensation would not be served if an employee lacked standing to seek relief under these statutes because he or she misrepresented information on his or her job application.  We therefore hold that the after-acquired evidence rule announced in McKennon applies to cases in which the after-acquired evidence concerns the employee\\'s misrepresentations in a job application or resume, as well as cases in which the after-acquired evidence relates to employee wrongdoing during employment.  See Shattuck v. Kinetic Concepts, Inc., 49 F.3d 1106 (5th Cir.1995) (applying McKennon to case in which the employer discovered that plaintiff had lied about his education on his resume);  Ryan\\'s Family Steak Houses, Inc., 49 F.3d at 1150 (applying McKennon to case in which employer discovered that plaintiff had lied about employment background and medical history on resume);  Hercules Inc., 52 F.3d at 294 (remanding fraud-in-application case for proceedings \"consistent with the Supreme Court decision in McKennon \").6\\n    \\n    V. Remedies7\\n    A.\\n    \\n      16\\n      In order to benefit from the after-acquired evidence rule announced in McKennon, Dunn must prove that \"the misconduct revealed by the deposition was so grave that [Neal\\'s] immediate discharge would have followed its disclosure in any event.\"  --- U.S. at ----, 115 S. Ct. at 883.8\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      Our review of the record convinces us that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Neal would have been fired when Dunn learned that Neal had lied on her job application about her prior conviction.  The Employee Handbook, a copy of which Neal received when she began work, states that falsification of records is conduct for which the company will impose a penalty that may include termination.  Two defense witnesses, Tina Fuller and Becky Wallace, stated at their depositions that if someone lied on a job application and Dunn found out, the person could be fired.  Dunn\\'s Accountant and Manager for Administration and its Safety Training Director submitted affidavits that Dunn would have fired Neal upon learning that she lied on her application about her drug conviction.  In the face of this evidence, Neal provided only her own testimony that she thought that there was a woman who lied on her job application and kept her job.  She submitted no proof that anyone who lied on the application about a drug offense was retained after Dunn learned of the misrepresentation.  We therefore hold that Dunn has sufficiently demonstrated that Neal would have been fired when it learned of her misrepresentation.\\n    \\n    B.\\n    \\n      18\\n      We now set forth some general principles to assist the district court in fashioning a remedy in the event that Neal prevails on her claims under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII.9  With respect to Neal\\'s inadequate compensation claim,10 the after-acquired evidence will be irrelevant to her recovery of unpaid wages or liquidated damages because a plaintiff only recovers unpaid wages for the allowable statutory period11 and does not recover any unpaid wages or liquidated damages after termination.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      Assuming that Neal prevails on her retaliation claim under the Equal Pay Act12 or her Title VII claims, \"neither reinstatement nor front pay [will be] an appropriate remedy\" because Dunn would have fired Neal upon learning that she lied about her drug conviction.  McKennon, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S. Ct. at 886.   Injunctive relief also will not be appropriate, as Neal will no longer be employed at Dunn.  See Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 905 (11th Cir.1982) (in the absence of reinstatement, injunctive relief is \"unlikely\").\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      With respect to backpay under Title VII and lost wages under the Equal Pay Act, if Neal prevails on her claims, \"[t]he beginning point in the trial court\\'s formulation of a remedy should be calculation of backpay from the date of the unlawful discharge to the date the new information was discovered.\"  --- U.S. at ----, 115 S. Ct. at 886.   The Supreme Court has also made clear that although this is the usual method for calculating damages in an after-acquired evidence case, \"[i]n determining the appropriate order for relief, the court can consider taking into further account extraordinary equitable circumstances that affect the legitimate interests of either party.\"  Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      We also note that unless Dunn can show that it acted in good faith and with a reasonable belief that it was not violating the Equal Pay Act, Neal will be able to collect liquidated damages for her retaliation claim.  See E.E.O.C. v. White &amp; Son Enters., 881 F.2d 1006, 1012 (11th Cir.1989).  The after-acquired evidence is irrelevant to Dunn\\'s mental state and thus does not bar these liquidated damages under the Equal Pay Act.  The evidence is relevant for the purpose of calculating the award, as it may, as explained above, mandate an early end to the period of liquidated damages.\\n    \\n    VI. Conclusion\\n    \\n      22\\n      Because reinstatement, front pay, and injunctive relief are unavailable to Neal under the facts of this case, the district court erred in not granting partial summary judgment in favor of Dunn with respect to these remedies.  The district court, however, correctly denied summary judgment as to backpay, unpaid wages and liquidated damages, as the after-acquired evidence does not bar recovery, but merely affects the remedy.  We therefore REVERSE the district court\\'s denial of summary judgment with respect to front pay, reinstatement, and injunctive relief, and REMAND to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        *\\n         Senior U.S. Circuit Judge John C.

Jenkins Brickyard, Inc., 678 F.2d 911, 917 (11th Cir.1982) (discussing the deterrent purpose of Title VII);  29 U.S.C. Secs. 206(d)(3), 216 (providing for liquidated and compensatory damages for violation of the Equal Pay Act);  Thompson v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 866 F.2d 709, 712 (4th Cir.1989) (noting that liquidated damage award under Equal Pay Act serves, in part, as \"a deterrent to ensure compliance with the Act\")\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         Our conclusion is bolstered by the Supreme Court\\'s vacating and remanding two fraud-in-application cases for reconsideration in light of McKennon.   See O\\'Driscoll v. Hercules Inc., --- U.S. ----, 115 S. Ct. 1086, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1056 (1995);  Harleysville Life Ins. Co. v. Mardell, --- U.S. ----, 115 S. Ct. 1397, 131 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1995)\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         Neal\\'s suit was commenced prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  We do not consider the effect of after-acquired evidence on the remedies available under that Act, as they are unavailable to Neal.  See Curtis v. Metro Ambulance Service, Inc., 982 F.2d 472, 473-74 (11th Cir.1993) (Civil Rights Act of 1991 does not apply retroactively)\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         We join the Fifth Circuit in concluding that \"the pertinent inquiry, except in refusal-to-hire cases, is whether the employee would have been fired upon discovery of the wrongdoing, not whether he would have been hired in the first instance.\"  Kinetic Concepts, Inc., 49 F.3d at 1108\\n        This approach is consistent with the Supreme Court\\'s acknowledgement that the two dates which are relevant for the purpose of calculating backpay are the date of termination and the date that the employer discovered the fraud.  See McKennon, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S. Ct. at 886.   It also recognizes that the purpose of considering the after-acquired evidence in fashioning a remedy is \"to take due account of the lawful prerogatives of the employer\" and not to \"punish the employee.\"  Id.  Finally, this approach acknowledges that \"[m]erely asking whether the employee would have been hired fails to recognize that an employer may retain an individual, who has performed successfully.\"  Shattuck, 49 F.3d at 1109.\\n      \\n      \\n        9\\n         We stress that we express no opinion about the merits of any of Neal\\'s claims\\n      \\n      \\n        10\\n         See 29 U.S.C.

During the\\n\\ncourse of discovery in this proceeding, plaintiff subpoenaed Donald\\n\\nLewis, who was an employee of the Department of Agriculture to\\n\\nappear for a deposition and to bring with him copies of \"[a]ny and\\n\\nall documents, records, calendars, diaries, correspondence and\\n\\nmemoranda pertaining or in anywise relating to any charge of\\n\\ndiscrimination filed by [Lewis] or on [Lewis\u2019] behalf against the\\n\\nDepartment of Agriculture, or any of its employees.\" Lewis had, in\\n\\nfact, himself      filed   suit    in   another    division   of    the   Eastern\\n\\nDistrict of Louisiana against the Department of Agriculture. Lewis\\n\\nfailed and refused to produce the requested documentation and\\n\\nplaintiff cited him for contempt.            The magistrate judge ordered\\n\\nLewis to comply with the subpoena and upon his failure accessed\\n\\nattorney\u2019s fees and costs against him.             Lewis filed a motion with\\n\\nthe district judge to reconsider the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling, but\\n\\nthe district judge declined and affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s\\n\\nrulings.

JUSTICE BLACK.\\nThis case, which involves an alleged discrimination against a Negro family in the use of certain community facilities, has been here before. The Virginia trial court dismissed petitioners\\' complaints and the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia denied the appeals saying that they were not perfected \"in the manner provided by law in that opposing counsel was not given reasonable written notice of the time and place of tendering the transcript and a reasonable opportunity to examine the original or a true copy of it\" under that court\\'s Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f).[1]\\nThe case came here and we granted the petition for certiorari and vacated the judgments and remanded the case to the Supreme Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of Jones v. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409. 392 U.S. 657. On the remand, the Supreme Court of Appeals restated its prior position stating, \"We had no jurisdiction in the cases when they were here before, and we have no jurisdiction now. We adhere to our orders refusing the appeals in these cases.\" 209 Va. 279, 163 S.E.2d 588. We brought the case here the second time on a petition for certiorari. 394 U.S. 942.\\n\\n\\n*232 I\\nWhen the case was first here respondents opposed the petition, claiming that Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f), was not complied with. Petitioners filed a reply brief addressing themselves to that question. Thus the point now tendered was fully exposed when the case was here before, though we ruled on it sub silentio.\\nIn this case counsel for petitioners on June 9, 1967, gave oral notice to counsel for respondents that he was submitting the transcripts to the trial judge. He wrote counsel for respondents on the same day to the same effect, saying he was submitting the transcripts to the trial judge that day, filing motions to correct them, and asking the trial court to defer signing them for a ten-day period to allow counsel for respondents time to consent to the motions or have them otherwise disposed of by the court. The judge, being absent from his chambers on June 9, ruled that he had not received the transcripts until June 12. The motions to correct came on for a hearing June 16, at which time the judge ruled that he would not act on the motions until counsel for respondents had agreed or disagreed with the changes requested. After examining the transcripts between June 16 and June 19, counsel for respondents told counsel for petitioners that he had no objections to the corrections or to entry of orders granting the motions to correct. Counsel for respondents then signed the proposed orders which counsel for petitioners had prepared. The proposed orders were submitted to the trial judge on June 20; and on the same day he signed the transcripts, after they had been corrected.\\nAs we read its cases, the Supreme Court of Appeals stated the controlling principle in the following language:\\n\"The requirement that opposing counsel have a reasonable opportunity to examine the transcript sets out the purpose of reasonable notice. If, after *233 receipt of notice, opposing counsel be afforded reasonable opportunity to examine the transcript, and to make objections thereto, if any he has, before it is signed by the trial judge, the object of reasonable notice will have been attained.\" Bacigalupo v. Fleming, 199 Va. 827, 835, 102 S.E.2d 321, 326.\\nIn that case opposing counsel had seven days to examine the record and make any objections. In the present case he had three days. But so far as the record shows he did not at the time complain that he was not given that \"reasonable opportunity\" he needed to examine and correct the transcripts.\\nPetitioners\\' counsel does not urge\\x97nor do we suggest \\x97that the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has fashioned a novel procedural requirement for the first time in this case; cf. NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 457-458; past decisions of the state court refute any such notion. See Bacigalupo v. Fleming, supra; Bolin v. Laderberg, 207 Va. 795, 153 S.E.2d 251; Cook v. Virginia Holsum Bakeries, 207 Va. 815, 153 S.E.2d 209.[2] But those same decisions do not enable us *234 to say that the Virginia court has so consistently applied its notice requirement as to amount to a self-denial of the power to entertain the federal claim here presented if the Supreme Court of Appeals desires to do so. See Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 455-457 (BLACK, J., dissenting). Such a rule, more properly deemed discretionary than jurisdictional, does not bar review here by certiorari.\\n\\nII\\nLittle Hunting Park, Inc., is a Virginia nonstock corporation organized to operate a community park and playground facilities for the benefit of residents in an area of Fairfax County, Virginia. A membership share entitles all persons in the immediate family of the shareholder to use the corporation\\'s recreation facilities. Under the bylaws a person owning a membership share is entitled when he rents his home to assign the share to his tenant, subject to approval of the board of directors. Paul E. Sullivan and his family owned a house *235 in this area and lived in it. Later he bought another house in the area and leased the first one to T. R. Freeman, Jr., an employee of the U. S. Department of Agriculture; and assigned his membership share to Freeman. The board refused to approve the assignment because Freeman was a Negro. Sullivan protested that action and was notified that he would be expelled from the corporation by the board. A hearing was accorded him and he was expelled, the board tendering him cash for his two shares.\\nSullivan and Freeman sued under 42 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982 for injunctions and monetary damages. Since Freeman no longer resides in the area served by Little Hunting Park, Inc., his claim is limited solely to damages.\\nThe trial court denied relief to each petitioner. We reverse those judgments.\\nIn Jones v. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, we reviewed at length the legislative history of 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 1982.[3] We concluded that it reaches beyond state action and operates upon the unofficial acts of private individuals and that it is authorized by the Enabling Clause of the Thirteenth Amendment. We said:\\n\"Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom\\x97 freedom to `go and come at pleasure\\' and to `buy and sell when they please\\'\\x97would be left with `a mere paper guarantee\\' if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands *236 of a white man. At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep.\" 392 U.S., at 443.\\nThe Virginia trial court rested on its conclusion that Little Hunting Park was a private social club. But we find nothing of the kind on this record. There was no plan or purpose of exclusiveness. It is open to every white person within the geographic area, there being no selective element other than race. See Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298, 301-302. What we have here is a device functionally comparable to a racially restrictive covenant, the judicial enforcement of which was struck down in Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nIn Jones v. Mayer Co., the complaint charged a refusal to sell petitioner a home because he was black. In the instant case the interest conveyed was a leasehold of realty coupled with a membership share in a nonprofit company organized to offer recreational facilities to owners and lessees of real property in that residential area. It is not material whether the membership share be considered realty or personal property, as \u00a7 1982 covers both. Section 1982 covers the right \"to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\" There is a suggestion that transfer on the books of the corporation of Freeman\\'s share is not covered by any of those verbs. The suggestion is without merit. There has never been any doubt but that Freeman paid part of his $129 monthly rental for the *237 assignment of the membership share in Little Hunting Park. The transaction clearly fell within the \"lease.\" The right to \"lease\" is protected by \u00a7 1982 against the actions of third parties, as well as against the actions of the immediate lessor. Respondents\\' actions in refusing to approve the assignment of the membership share in this case was clearly an interference with Freeman\\'s right to \"lease.\" A narrow construction of the language of \u00a7 1982 would be quite inconsistent with the broad and sweeping nature of the protection meant to be afforded by \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, from which \u00a7 1982 was derived. See 392 U.S., at 422-437.\\nWe turn to Sullivan\\'s expulsion for the advocacy of Freeman\\'s cause. If that sanction, backed by a state court judgment, can be imposed, then Sullivan is punished for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities protected by \u00a7 1982. Such a sanction would give impetus to the perpetuation of racial restrictions on property. That is why we said in Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 259, that the white owner is at times \"the only effective adversary\" of the unlawful restrictive covenant. Under the terms of our decision in Barrows, there can be no question but that Sullivan has standing to maintain this action.\\nWe noted in Jones v. Mayer Co., that the Fair Housing Title of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 81, in no way impaired the sanction of \u00a7 1982. 392 U.S., at 413-417. What we said there is adequate to dispose of the suggestion that the public accommodations provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243, in some way supersedes the provisions of the 1866 Act. For the hierarchy of administrative machinery provided by the 1964 Act is not at war with survival of the principles embodied in \u00a7 1982. There is, moreover, a saving clause in the 1964 Act as respects \"any *238 right based on any other Federal . . . law not inconsistent\" with that Act.[4]\\nSection 1982 derived from the 1866 Act is plainly \"not inconsistent\" with the 1964 Act, which has been construed as not \"pre-empting every other mode of protecting a federal `right\\' or as granting immunity\" to those who had long been subject to federal law. United States v. Johnson, 390 U.S. 563, 566.\\nWe held in Jones v. Mayer Co. that although \u00a7 1982 is couched in declaratory terms and provides no explicit method of enforcement, a federal court has power to fashion an effective equitable remedy. 392 U.S., at 414, n. 13. That federal remedy for the protection of a federal right is available in the state court, if that court is empowered to grant injunctive relief generally, as is the Virginia court. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 8-610 (1957 Repl. Vol.).\\nFinally, as to damages, Congress, by 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1343 (4), created federal jurisdiction for \"damages or . . . equitable or other relief under any Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights . . . .\" We reserved in Jones v. Mayer Co., 392 U. S., at 414-415, n. 14, the question of what damages, if any, might be appropriately recovered for a violation of \u00a7 1982.\\nWe had a like problem in Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, where suit was brought against federal officers for alleged *239 violations of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The federal statute did not in terms at least provide any remedy. We said:\\n\"[W]here federally protected rights have been invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief. And it is also well settled that where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done.\" Id., at 684.\\nThe existence of a statutory right implies the existence of all necessary and appropriate remedies. See Texas &amp; N. O. R. Co. v. Railway Clerks, 281 U.S. 548, 569-570. As stated in Texas &amp; Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby, 241 U.S. 33, 39:\\n\"A disregard of the command of the statute is a wrongful act, and where it results in damage to one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted, the right to recover the damages from the party in default is implied . . . .\"\\nCompensatory damages for deprivation of a federal right are governed by federal standards, as provided by Congress in 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 1988, which states:\\n\"The jurisdiction in civil . . . matters conferred on the district courts by the provisions of this chapter and Title 18, for the protection of all persons in the United States in their civil rights, and for their vindication, shall be exercised and enforced in conformity with the laws of the United States, so far as such laws are suitable to carry the same into effect; but in all cases where they are not adapted to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary *240 to furnish suitable remedies and punish offenses against law, the common law, as modified and changed by the constitution and statutes of the State wherein the court having jurisdiction of such civil or criminal cause is held, so far as the same is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, shall be extended to and govern the said courts in the trial and disposition of the cause . . . .\"\\nThis means, as we read \u00a7 1988, that both federal and state rules on damages may be utilized, whichever better serves the policies expressed in the federal statutes. Cf. Brazier v. Cherry, 293 F.2d 401. The rule of damages, whether drawn from federal or state sources, is a federal rule responsive to the need whenever a federal right is impaired. We do not explore the problem further, as the issue of damages was not litigated below.\\nIt is suggested, not by any party, but by the dissent, that any relief should await proceedings under the fair housing provisions of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. 82 Stat. 81, 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 3601 et seq. (1964 ed., Supp. IV). But petitioners\\' suits were commenced on March 16, 1966, two years before that Act was passed. It would be irresponsible judicial administration to dismiss a suit because of an intervening Act[5] which has no possible application to events long preceding its enactment.\\nReversed.\\n*241 MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE WHITE join, dissenting.\\nIn Jones v. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (1968), the Court decided that a little-used section of a 100-year-old statute prohibited private racial discrimination in the sale of real property. This construction of a very old statute, in no way required by its language,[1] and open to serious question in light of the statute\\'s legislative history,[2] seemed to me unnecessary and unwise because of the recently passed, but then not yet fully effective, Fair Housing Title of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (hereafter Fair Housing Law).[3] Today, the Court goes yet beyond Jones (1) by implying a private right to damages for violations of 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 1982; (2) by interpreting \u00a7 1982 to prohibit a community recreation association from withholding, on the basis of race, approval of an assignment of a membership that was transferred incident to a lease of real property; and (3) by deciding that a white person who is expelled from a recreation association \"for the advocacy of [a Negro\\'s] cause\" has \"standing\" to maintain an action for relief under \u00a7 1982.\\nBecause the Fair Housing Law will become fully effective less than three weeks from now,[4] I think the majority even more unwise than it was in Jones, in precipitately breathing still more life into \u00a7 1982, which is both vague and open-ended, when Congress has provided *242 this modern statute, containing various detailed remedial provisions aimed at eliminating racial discrimination in housing. For this reason, which I elaborate in Part II, I would dismiss the writ in this case as improvidently granted. To provide examples of some of the difficulties the Court will inevitably encounter if it continues to employ \u00a7 1982 in these sorts of cases, I examine in Part III the undiscriminating manner in which the majority deals with, and for the most part ignores, the complexities involved in (1) giving Sullivan relief and (2) engrafting a damage remedy onto \u00a7 1982 in a case arising from a state court. But, first, I consider the threshold question of whether there is present in this case an adequate state ground which would bar review by this Court.\\n\\nI\\n\\nADEQUACY OF THE STATE GROUND\\nThe Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, both before and after this Court\\'s earlier remand, refused to consider the federal questions presented to it because it found that petitioners had failed to give opposing counsel \"reasonable written notice of the time and place of tendering the transcript and a reasonable opportunity to examine the original or a true copy of it,\" in violation of Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f), of the local rules of court.[5] The majority here suggests that the State\\'s procedural requirement, though not a \"novel\" one \"fashioned . . . for the first time in this case,\" nevertheless had not been \"so consistently applied . . . as to amount to a self-denial of the power to entertain the federal claim.\" The majority then goes on to conclude that because the State\\'s procedural rule is \"more properly deemed discretionary than jurisdictional,\" review should not be barred here. *243 I agree with the majority\\'s conclusion that there is no adequate state ground shown, but I find myself unable to subscribe to the majority\\'s reasoning, which appears to me unclear and confusing.\\nI am not certain what the majority means in its apparent distinction between rules that it deems \"discretionary\" and those that it deems \"jurisdictional.\" Perhaps the majority wishes to suggest that the dismissals of petitioners\\' writs of error by the Supreme Court of Appeals were simply ad hoc discretionary refusals to accept plenary review of the lower court\\'s decisions, analogous to this Court\\'s denial of certiorari. If this were all the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals had done, review of a federal question properly raised below would of course not be barred here. The mere discretionary refusal of the highest state court to grant review of a lower court decision does not provide an adequate state ground. In such circumstances, the decision of the lower court, rather than the order of the highest court refusing review, becomes the judgment of the \"highest court of a State in which a decision could be had\" for purposes of 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1257, our jurisdictional statute.[6]\\nBut this case clearly does not present this kind of discretionary refusal of a state appellate court to accept review. Although the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals may well have the \"discretion\" to refuse review[7] in a particular case without giving reasons or reconciling its refusal with earlier decisions, the dismissal below was not simply an ad hoc exercise of the power not to review every case presented. Instead the state court dismissed the petitions for review for a stated reason, namely, a *244 lack of \"jurisdiction to entertain the appeals because of the failure of counsel for the Sullivans and the Freemans to meet the requirements of Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f).\" When a state appellate court\\'s refusal to consider the merits of a case is based on the failure to conform to a state rule of practice, review by this Court is barred unless this Court is able to find that application of the state rule of practice to the case at hand does not constitute an adequate state ground. This is so quite irrespective of whether the state appellate court had the power to refuse review for no reason at all.[8]\\nThe majority might have another meaning in mind when it describes the State\\'s procedural rule as \"discretionary.\" It may be suggesting that \"reasonable written notice,\" and \"reasonable opportunity to examine\" are such flexible standards that the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has the \"discretion\" to decide a close case either of two ways without creating an obvious conflict with earlier decisions. If this is what the majority means by \"discretionary rule,\" then I must register my disagreement. This kind of \"discretion\" is nothing more than \"the judicial formulation of law,\" for a court has an obligation to be reasonably consistent and \"to explain the decision, including the reason for according different treatment to the instant case.\"[9] Surely a state ground *245 is no less adequate simply because it involves a standard that requires a judgment of what is reasonable, and because the result may turn on a close analysis of the facts of a particular case in light of competing policy considerations.\\nAlthough the majority\\'s loose use of the word \"discretionary\" may suggest that any decision made pursuant to a broad standard cannot provide an adequate state ground, I think examination of the earlier opinions of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, several of which are cited by the majority, provides the proper foundation for the result reached by the majority, under the principle of NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958).\\nThe finding of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals of a violation of Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f), in this case was in my view based on a standard of reasonableness much stricter than that which could have been fairly extracted from the earlier Virginia cases applying the rule[10] and its predecessor statute.[11] In other words, although Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f), itself may not be novel, the standard implicitly governing the rule\\'s application to the facts here was. I think it fair to conclude that in light of these earlier decisions, and the principle set forth in Bacigalupo v. Fleming, 199 Va. 827, 835, 102 S.E.2d 321, 326 (1958),[12] the petitioners here might have justifiably *246 thought that review in the Supreme Court of Appeals would not be barred by the rule, notwithstanding Snead v. Commonwealth, 200 Va. 850, 108 S.E.2d 399 (1959), the one case cited below by the Virginia court, relied on here by respondent and yet somehow ignored by the majority.[13] Because \"[n]ovelty in procedural requirements *247 cannot be permitted to thwart review in this Court applied for by those who, in justified reliance upon prior decisions, seek vindication in state courts of their federal . . . rights,\" NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S., at 457-458, I conclude that the decision below does not rest on an adequate state ground.\\n\\nII\\nBecause Congress has now provided a comprehensive scheme for dealing with the kinds of discrimination found in this case, I think it very unwise as a matter of policy for the Court to use \u00a7 1982 as a broad delegation of power to develop a common law of forbidden racial discriminations. A comparison of 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 1982 with the new Fair Housing Law, and consideration of the Court\\'s task in applying each, demonstrate to me the need for restraint, and the appropriateness of dismissing the writ in this case, now grounded solely on an alleged violation of \u00a7 1982.\\nPetitioners here complain of discrimination in the provision of recreation facilities ancillary to a rented house found in one of the four subdivisions served by Little Hunting Park. On the one hand, the Fair *248 Housing Law has a provision that explicitly makes it unlawful to \"discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of . . . rental [of housing], or in the provisions of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race, [or] color . . . .\" 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 3604 (b) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). (Emphasis added.) In contrast, as the majority in Jones noted, \u00a7 1982 \"does not deal specifically with discrimination in the provision of services or facilities in connection with the sale or rental of a dwelling,\" 392 U.S., at 413.\\nBy attempting to deal with the problem of discrimination in the provision of recreational facilities under \u00a7 1982, the Court is forced, in the context of a very vague statute, to decide what transactions involve \"property\" for purposes of \u00a7 1982. The majority states that \"[i]t is not material whether the membership share [in Little Hunting Park] be considered realty or personal property, as \u00a7 1982 covers both.\" But examination of the opinion will show that the majority has failed to explain why the membership share is either real or personal property for purposes of \u00a7 1982. The majority\\'s complete failure to articulate any standards for deciding what is property within the meaning of \u00a7 1982 is a fair indication of the great difficulties courts will inevitably confront if \u00a7 1982 is used to remedy racial discrimination in housing. And lurking in the background are grave constitutional issues should \u00a7 1982 be extended too far into some types of private discrimination.[14]\\nNot only does \u00a7 1982 fail to provide standards as to the types of transactions in which discrimination is unlawful, but it also contains no provisions for enforcement, either public or private. To give its construction of the statute effect, the Court has had to imply remedies *249 that Congress has not explicitly provided\\x97injunctive relief in Jones, and now a right to damages here. See Part III, infra.\\nThese remedies are expressly provided for in the Fair Housing Law, which, with its variety of techniques for enforcing its prohibition of housing discrimination, again stands in sharp contrast with \u00a7 1982. First, an injured party can complain to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development who is empowered to investigate complaints, and use \"informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion\" to secure compliance with the law.[15] Should the Secretary\\'s efforts prove unavailing, the complainant can go to court.[16] As an alternative to going first to HUD, it appears that a person may go directly to court to enforce his rights under the Fair Housing Law,[17] which expressly provides for a wide variety of relief, including restraining orders, injunctions, compensatory damages, and punitive damages up to $1,000.[18] Furthermore, the Act allows a court to appoint counsel and waive all fees for indigent plaintiffs, and to award costs and, in certain cases, counsel fees to a successful plaintiff.[19] In addition to actions initiated by private parties, the Attorney General is empowered to bring civil actions for preventive civil relief, and criminal actions to punish those who by force or threat of force willfully interfere with or intimidate *250 those who wish to exercise, or aid others in the exercise, of their rights under the Fair Housing Law.[20]\\nGiven this comprehensive, contemporary statute, the limitations of which have not yet even been established, I believe that the Court should not decide this case but should instead dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.[21] This Court\\'s certiorari jurisdiction should not be exercised simply \"for the benefit of the particular litigants,\" Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery, 349 U.S. 70, 74 (1955), but instead for the \"settlement of [issues] of importance to the public as distinguished from . . . the parties,\" Layne &amp; Bowler Corp. v. Western Well Works, Inc., 261 U.S. 387, 393 (1923). Even from the perspective of the parties, this case has lost much of its practical importance due to the fact that Dr. Freeman\\'s work has taken him and his family away from the area served by Little Hunting Park, thereby making moot his original claim for injunctive relief.[22] But more fundamentally, I think here, as I did in Jones, that the existence of the Fair Housing Law renders the decision of this case of little \"importance to the public.\" For, although the 1968 Act does not cover this particular case,[23] should a Negro in the future rent a house but be *251 denied access to ancillary recreational facilities on account of race, he could in all likelihood secure relief under the provisions of the Fair Housing Law.[24]\\n\\nIII\\nThe undiscriminating manner in which the Court has dealt with this case is both highlighted and compounded by the Court\\'s failure to face, let alone resolve, two issues that lie buried beneath the surface of its opinion. Both issues are difficult ones, and the fact that the majority has not come to grips with them serves to illustrate the inevitable difficulties the Court will encounter if it continues to employ \u00a7 1982 as a means for dealing with the many subtle human problems that are bound to arise as the goal of eliminating discriminatory practices in our national life is pursued.\\n\\nA. RELIEF FOR SULLIVAN\\nBecause the majority opinion is highly elliptical as to (1) the circumstances surrounding Sullivan\\'s expulsion from Little Hunting Park, (2) the relief Sullivan sought in the state court, and (3) the decision of the trial court, it is necessary for me to begin my analysis simply by stating the facts of these aspects of the case. A full *252 examination of the record reveals, first, the necessity for a remand on the majority\\'s own premises. It also makes apparent the majority\\'s failure to provide any guidance as to the legal standards that should govern Sullivan\\'s right to recovery on remand. An awareness of the complexity of the issues relevant to Sullivan\\'s right to redress suggests further, I think, the appropriateness of a discretionary denial of review.\\n1. The Circumstances of Sullivan\\'s Expulsion. After the Board of Little Hunting Park refused to approve the assignment of a membership share from Sullivan to Freeman, Sullivan attempted to convince the Board to reverse its decision. To this end, Sullivan first met with members of the Board, and protested their actions. He subsequently mobilized a campaign both by other members of the club and by persons in the community as a whole to force the Board to reconsider its decision. The means used in this campaign, as the brief for petitioner Sullivan acknowledges,[25] included phone calls to members of the Board, letters to local clergy, and the circulation among the members of Little Hunting Park of a petition that called for a meeting of the full membership to consider Dr. Freeman\\'s case.\\nOn July 8 Sullivan received a letter from the Board which stated that it had determined that there was \"due cause\" to warrant a hearing in order to determine whether Sullivan should be expelled from Little Hunting Park, pursuant to its bylaws, for \"conduct inimicable to the Corporation members.\" This letter referred to Sullivan\\'s \"non-acceptance of the Board\\'s decision on the assignment of your membership to your tenant . . . along with the continued harassment of the board members\" as the basis for the Board\\'s \"due cause\" determination.\\n*253 The Board subsequently provided a detailed specification of its charges against Sullivan,[26] and these included, inter alia, allegations that Sullivan had (a) instigated a campaign by which board members were harassed by \"unfriendly phone calls\" accusing them of bigotry; (b) used \"abusive\" language in a phone call to the president of the Board; (c) written letters to local clergy, including the minister of the church which employed the president of Little Hunting Park, accusing board members of participation in \"real moral evil\"; and (d) used \"violent and abusive language\" to members of Little Hunting Park who had refused to sign his petition. After the hearing on these charges, the Board expelled Sullivan and tendered to him the current market value of the two membership shares that he held.\\nIn response to these actions, Sullivan brought this suit in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, against Little Hunting Park and its Board seeking as relief (1) an order compelling Little Hunting Park to reinstate his membership; (2) monetary damages in the amount of $15,000; and (3) an injunction requiring the Board to approve the assignment to Freeman and forbidding the Board to use race as a factor in considering membership. The trial court, after hearing disputed evidence as to the reasons for Sullivan\\'s expulsion, found for the defendants. It stated that the *254 scope of its review of the Board\\'s actions was \"limited\" because Little Hunting Park was a \"private and social\" club, and then went on to find that the Board had acted within \"the powers conferred on it by the By-Laws\" in expelling Sullivan, and that \"there was ample evidence to justify [the Board\\'s] conclusion that the complainant\\'s acts were inimicable to the Corporation\\'s members and to the Corporation.\"\\n2. With this statement of the record in mind, several observations must be made about the majority\\'s treatment of Sullivan\\'s rights. First, in stating that \"Sullivan\\'s expulsion [was] for the advocacy of Freeman\\'s cause,\" the majority surely cannot be taken to have resolved disputed testimony, and decided the facts underlying Sullivan\\'s expulsion. If these facts are relevant to Sullivan\\'s remedial rights, as surely they must be, then a remand for detailed findings seems unavoidable under the majority\\'s own premises.\\nSecond, the majority has not explained what legal standard should determine Sullivan\\'s rights under \u00a7 1982. The majority simply states that \"Sullivan has standing to maintain this action\" under \u00a7 1982, without even acknowledging that some standard is essential for this case to be ultimately decided.\\nOne can imagine a variety of standards, each based on different legal conclusions as to the \"rights\" and \"duties\" created by \u00a7 1982, and each having very different remedial consequences. For example, does \u00a7 1982 give Sullivan a right to relief only for injuries resulting from Little Hunting Park\\'s interference with his statutory duty to Freeman under \u00a7 1982? If so, what is Sullivan\\'s duty to Freeman under \u00a7 1982? Unless \u00a7 1982 is read to impose a duty on Sullivan to protest Freeman\\'s exclusion, he would be entitled to reinstatement under this standard only if the Board had expelled him for the simple act of assigning his share to Freeman.\\n*255 As an alternative, Sullivan might be thought to be entitled to relief from those injuries that flowed from the Board\\'s violation of its \"duty\" to Freeman under \u00a7 1982. Such a standard might suggest that Sullivan is entitled to damages that resulted from Little Hunting Park\\'s initial refusal to accept the assignment to Freeman but again not to reinstatement. Or does the Court think that \u00a7 1982 gives Sullivan a right to relief from injuries that result from his \"legitimate\" protest aimed at convincing the Board to accept Freeman? If so, what protest activities were legitimate here? Most extreme would be a standard that would give Sullivan relief from injuries that were the result of any actions he took to protest the Board\\'s initial refusal, irrespective of Sullivan\\'s means of protest. Only this standard would require reinstatement, irrespective of the disputed facts here. But this standard would mean that \u00a7 1982 gave Sullivan a right to regain his membership even if the Board has expelled him for using intemperate and abusive threats as a means of protesting Freeman\\'s exclusion.[27]\\n\\nB. STATE COURT REMEDIES FOR FEDERAL RIGHTS\\nBecause this case arises from a state court, it presents special problems which the majority overlooks, and which suggests again the undesirability of deciding this case in the context of this ancient statute. In deciding that there is a right to recover damages in this case, the majority overlooks the complications involved by dint of the fact that a state court is being asked to provide *256 a remedy for a federal right bottomed on a federal statute that itself has no remedial provisions.\\nImplied remedies for federal rights are sometimes solely a matter of federal law[28] and other times dependent, either wholly or partially, upon state law.[29] Difficult and complex questions are involved in determining what remedies a state court must[30] or must not[31] provide in cases involving federal rights.[32]\\nIt should be noted that the majority\\'s opinion, though perhaps deciding very little[33] only adds to the confusion already existing in this area. Section 1988 of Title 42, which the majority apparently thinks decides this case, is concerned with the remedial powers of federal district courts and it provides that the federal courts shall look to state law to find appropriate remedies when the applicable federal civil rights law is \"deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies . . . .\" But the majority turns this provision on its head by suggesting (1) that \u00a7 1988 creates a federal remedy, apart from state law, when the remedial provisions of a civil rights statute, like \u00a7 1982, are \"deficient\"; and (2) that \u00a7 1988 itself somehow imposes this federal remedy on the States. *257 If \u00a7 1988 says anything at all relevant for this case, it suggests that in those cases where it is appropriate to cure remedial deficiencies of a federal civil rights statute by implication, this is to be done by looking to state law to see what remedies, consistent with federal policies, would be available there.\\nBy reason of these considerations, many of which could hardly have been foreseen at the time certiorari was granted, I would dismiss the writ in this case as improvidently granted.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Rule 5:1 which is entitled \"The Record on Appeal\" states the following in \u00a7 3 (f):\\n\\n\"Such a transcript or statement not signed by counsel for all parties becomes part of the record when delivered to the clerk, if it is tendered to the judge within 60 days and signed at the end by him within 70 days after final judgment. It shall be forthwith delivered to the clerk who shall certify on it the date he receives it. Counsel tendering the transcript or statement shall give opposing counsel reasonable written notice of the time and place of tendering it and a reasonable opportunity to examine the original or a true copy of it. The signature of the judge, without more, will be deemed to be his certification that counsel had the required notice and opportunity, and that the transcript or statement is authentic. He shall note on it the date it was tendered to him and the date it was signed by him.\"\\n[2]  In Bolin v. Laderberg, 207 Va. 795, 153 S.E.2d 251, appellants\\' counsel had delivered the transcript to appellees\\' counsel on November 24, 1965. The transcript was tendered to the trial judge on November 26, and was signed by him on December 3. Appellees moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that they had not been given \"reasonable notice and opportunity\" under Rule 5:1. The court stated that the motion should be overruled on the ground that Rule 5:1 provides that \"[t]he signature of the judge, without more, will be deemed to be his certification that counsel had the required notice and opportunity, and that the transcript . . . is authentic.\" The court noted that the judge\\'s \"signature appears on the transcript without more and is, therefore, his certification that counsel for [appellees] had the required notice of tendering the transcript and the required opportunity to examine it.\" Id., at 797, 153 S.E.2d, at 253.\\n\\nIn Cook v. Virginia Holsum Bakeries, 207 Va. 815, 153 S.E.2d 209, notice that the transcript would be tendered to the trial judge on October 20, 1965, was given to counsel for the appellee on October 15. Appellant\\'s counsel, however, did not obtain a copy of the transcript until October 19. At a conference held on that same date, counsel for both parties went over the transcript and agreed on certain corrections and additions. At the hearing on October 20, appellee\\'s counsel claimed he had not been given the reasonable notice and opportunity required by Rule 5:1. He then suggested numerous changes, and the trial judge ordered the transcript altered to reflect those changes. The revised transcript was tendered to the trial judge the next day, October 21, and signed by him that same day. On appeal, appellee moved to dismiss on the ground that the Rule 5:1 requirements had not been satisfied. The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals overruled the motion, stating: \"The narrative was amended to meet the suggested changes of counsel for [appellee], and he conceded in oral argument before us that the statement signed by the trial judge was correct.\" Id., at 817, 153 S.E.2d, at 210.\\n[3]  42 U.S. C. \u00a7 1982 provides:\\n\\n\"All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\"\\n[4]  Section 207 (b) of the Act of July 2, 1964, 78 Stat. 246, provides:\\n\\n\"The remedies provided in this title shall be the exclusive means of enforcing the rights based on this title, but nothing in this title shall preclude any individual or any State or local agency from asserting any right based on any other Federal or State law not inconsistent with this title, including any statute or ordinance requiring nondiscrimination in public establishments or accommodations, or from pursuing any remedy, civil or criminal, which may be available for the vindication or enforcement of such right.\"\\n[5]  The Act is not fully effective until December 31, 1969. 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 3603 (b) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). Even at that time it will not apply to a \"single-family house\" if the house is sold without the services of a real estate broker and without the notice described in \u00a7 3604 (c) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). See \u00a7 3603 (b) (1964 ed., Supp. IV).

Georgia, 349 U.S. 375 (1955), which is not cited by the majority, does not in my view support the reasoning of the majority. I think the result in Williams rests upon a determination of inconsistency in the application of the State\\'s procedural requirements for a new trial. See 349 U.S., at 383.\\n[10]  Bolin v. Laderberg, 207 Va. 795, 153 S.E.2d 251 (1967); Cook v. Virginia Holsum Bakeries, 207 Va. 815, 153 S.E.2d 209 (1967); Taylor v. Wood, 201 Va. 615, 112 S.E.2d 907 (1960); Bacigalupo v. Fleming, 199 Va. 827, 102 S.E.2d 321 (1958).\\n[11]  Stokely v. Owens, 189 Va. 248, 52 S.E.2d 164 (1949); Grimes v. Crouch, 175 Va. 126, 7 S.E.2d 115 (1940).\\n[12]  It can be seen from the passage quoted by the majority, see ante, at 232-233, that Bacigalupo interpreted the rule as requiring that (1) opposing counsel must have a reasonable opportunity to examine the transcript after he receives notice; and (2) based on this examination, opposing counsel must have a reasonable opportunity to make any objections he has to the accuracy of the transcript before the transcript is signed by the trial judge. In this case, opposing counsel received notice by telephone on Friday, June 9, and by letter the following Monday. His opportunity to examine the transcript consisted of the time between Monday and Friday when the transcript was available to him in the judge\\'s chambers; and the time between Friday, June 16, and Monday, the 19th, when he actually had in his possession a copy of the transcript. Any argument that this length of time, per se, is not reasonable opportunity is belied by Cook v. Virginia Holsum Bakeries, supra, where opposing counsel received a copy of a narrative only two days before the trial judge signed it, and the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals found no violation of the rule.\\n[13]  In Snead, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals said:\\n\\n\"It is important that time be given opposing counsel for a reasonable opportunity to analyze such statements characterized by defendant\\'s counsel as being confusing. The entire testimony of a very material witness was left out of the narrative statement when it was presented to the trial judge and it was necessary for him to insert it. We are of the opinion that the notice delivered to the Commonwealth\\'s Attorney at his residence, after office hours, thirty minutes before tendering a narrative statement of the evidence to the trial judge for his signature, does not constitute reasonable notice within the plain meaning of Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f) and that the terms of the Rule are mandatory and jurisdictional.\" 200 Va., at 854, 108 S. E. 2d, at 402.\\nThis case is far different from Snead in significant respects. First, in Snead the court was not confronted with a transcript but instead with a narrative; and this narrative was, by the admission of appellant\\'s own counsel, \"of a confusing nature and character.\" In this case, on the other hand, the record fails to show that counsel for respondent made any objection to the trial judge as to the adequacy of the notice, or to the accuracy of the transcript, see Taylor v. Wood, supra; Stokely v. Owens, supra. Furthermore, at oral argument before this Court, counsel for respondent could not point to a single inaccuracy in the transcript as signed by the trial judge. Tr. of Oral Arg. 20. Second, in Snead opposing counsel was only given one-half hour\\'s notice of a proposed tender to the judge for signature that night. In this case, although the transcript was sent to the judge at about the same time as opposing counsel received notice, that notice stated that the judge would not be asked to sign the transcript for a week, so counsel could first have an opportunity to examine it.\\nRespondent suggests that the rule requires that opposing counsel have notice and an opportunity to examine the transcript before the transcript is given to the judge rather than simply before the judge signs it. No prior Virginia case of which we have been made aware has so stated, however, and the principle of Bacigalupo quoted by the majority suggests that the key is that there be an opportunity to inspect and to make objections before the judge signs the transcript.\\n[14]  See Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883).\\n[15]  42 U.S. C. \u00a7 3610 (a) (1964 ed., Supp. IV).\\n[16]  Id., \u00a7 3610 (d).\\n[17]  Id., \u00a7 3612.

Rev. 40 (1961).\\n[22]  Given that the market price of a membership share in Little Hunting Park apparently ranged from $150 to $230 during the time in question, see Government\\'s Amicus Brief 5, Freeman\\'s compensatory damages will not, in all probability, be substantial. And, as I point out in the next section, unresolved factual issues may bar any relief at all for Sullivan.\\n[23]  The relevant events in this case all took place in 1965, long before the Fair Housing Law first went into effect on April 11, 1968. Whether the Fair Housing Law would protect Dr. Freeman were like events to take place again after December 31, 1969, in part would depend upon whether the transaction between Sullivan and Freeman would fall within any of the categories described in n. 24, infra. On the facts as they appear in this record, the exemption found in 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 3607 (1964 ed., Supp. IV) would not appear to bar recovery.\\n[24]  In addition to covering all single-family houses not owned by private individuals, and single-family houses owned by a private individual who owns more than three houses, the Fair Housing Law, after December 31, 1969, covers the rental of all single-family homes (a) rented with the help of a real estate broker; or (b) offered for rental through a written notice or advertisement which is discriminatory. See 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 3603 (b) (1964 ed., Supp. IV).\\n[25]  See Petitioners\\' Brief 9-11, 39-50.\\n[26]  See Appendix 181-182, 185-186. The detailed specification of charges against Sullivan was given by Little Hunting Park as part of a settlement of a suit brought by Sullivan to enjoin the hearing on his expulsion. This earlier suit, which was dismissed by agreement between the parties, was brought by Sullivan because of the vagueness of the July 8 letter as to the conduct upon which the due-cause hearing was to be held. The settlement of this earlier suit also included a stipulation between Sullivan and Little Hunting Park as to future lawsuits, which respondents claimed below barred Sullivan\\'s suit before us now. This aspect of the stipulation was noted, but not passed on, by the trial judge below.\\n[27]  Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249 (1953), upon which the majority appears to place heavy reliance, gives no guidance as to the extent a state court is obliged to allow a white person to recover affirmatively either damages or other relief after he has transferred a real estate interest to a Negro. In Barrows the Court held that damages could not be awarded against a white defendant sued for breach of a racially restrictive covenant.\\n[28]  See J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426 (1964).\\n[29]  See Ward v. Love County, 253 U.S. 17 (1920); The Tungus v. Skovgaard, 358 U.S. 588 (1959).\\n[30]  Testa v.

The Virginia trial court dismissed petitioners\u2019 complaints and the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia denied the appeals saying that they were not perfected \u201cin the manner provided by law in that opposing counsel was not given reasonable written notice of the time and place of tendering the transcript and a reasonable opportunity to examine the original or a true copy of it\u201d under that court\u2019s Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3(f).1\\nThe case came here and we granted the petition for certiorari and vacated the judgments and remanded the case to the Supreme Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of Jones v. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409. 392 U. S. 657. On the remand, the Supreme Court of Appeals restated its prior position stating, \u201cWe had no jurisdiction in the cases when they were here before, and we have no jurisdiction now. We adhere to our orders refusing the appeals in these cases.\u201d 209 Va. 279, 163 S. E. 2d 588. We brought the case here the second time on a petition for certiorari. 394 U. S. 942.\\n*232I\\nWhen the ease was first here respondents opposed the petition, claiming that Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f), was not complied with. Petitioners filed a reply brief addressing themselves to that question. Thus the point now tendered was fully exposed when the case was here before, though we ruled on it sub silentio.\\nIn this case counsel for petitioners on June 9, 1967, gave oral notice to counsel for respondents that he was submitting the transcripts to the trial judge. He wrote counsel for respondents on the same day to the same effect, saying he was submitting the transcripts to the trial judge that day, filing motions to correct them, and asking the trial court to defer signing them for a ten-day period to allow counsel for respondents time to consent to the motions or have them otherwise disposed of by the court. The judge, being absent from his chambers on June 9, ruled that he had not received the transcripts until June 12. The motions to correct came on for a hearing June 16, at which time the judge ruled that he would not act on the motions until counsel for respondents had agreed or disagreed with the changes requested. After examining the transcripts between June 16 and June 19, counsel for respondents told counsel for petitioners that he had no objections to the corrections or to entry of orders granting the motions to correct. Counsel for respondents then signed the proposed orders which counsel for petitioners had prepared. The proposed orders were submitted to the trial judge on June 20; and on the same day he signed the transcripts, after they had been corrected.\\nAs we read its cases, the Supreme Court of Appeals stated the controlling principle in the following language:\\n\u201cThe requirement that opposing counsel have a reasonable opportunity to examine the transcript sets out the purpose of reasonable notice. If, after *233receipt of notice, opposing counsel be afforded reasonable opportunity to examine the transcript, and to make objections thereto, if any he has, before it is signed by the trial judge, the object of reasonable notice will have been attained.\u201d Bacigalupo v. Fleming, 199 Va. 827, 835, 102 S. E. 2d 321, 326.\\nIn that case opposing counsel had seven days to examine the record and make any objections. In the present case he had three days. But so far as the record shows he did not at the time complain that he was not given that \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d he needed to examine and correct the transcripts.\\nPetitioners\u2019 counsel does not urge \u2014 nor do we suggest \u2014 that the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has fashioned a novel procedural requirement for the first time in this case; cf. NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S. 449, 457-A58; past decisions of the state court refute any such notion. See Bacigalupo v. Fleming, supra; Bolin v. Laderberg, 207 Va. 795, 153 S. E. 2d 251; Cook v. Virginia Holsum Bakeries, 207 Va. 815, 153 S. E. 2d 209.2 But those same decisions do not enable us *234to say that the Virginia court has so consistently applied its notice requirement as to amount to a self-denial of the power to entertain the federal claim here presented if the Supreme Court of Appeals desires to do so. See Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U. S. 443, 455-457 (Black, J., dissenting). Such a rule, more properly deemed discretionary than jurisdictional, does not bar review here by certiorari.\\nII\\nLittle Hunting Park, Inc., is a Virginia nonstock corporation organized to operate a community park and playground facilities for the benefit of residents in an area of Fairfax County, Virginia. A membership share entitles all persons in the immediate family of the shareholder to use the corporation\u2019s recreation facilities. Under the bylaws a person owning a membership share is entitled when he rents his home to assign the share to his tenant, subject to approval of the board of directors. Paul E. Sullivan and his family owned a house *235in this area and lived in it. Later he bought another house in the area and leased the first one to T. R. Freeman, Jr., an employee of the U. S. Department of Agriculture; and assigned his membership share to Freeman. The board refused to approve the assignment because Freeman was a Negro. Sullivan protested that action and was notified that he would be expelled from the corporation by the board. A hearing was accorded him and he was expelled, the board tendering him cash for his two shares.\\nSullivan and Freeman sued under 42 LT. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982 for injunctions and monetary damages. Since Freeman no longer resides in the area served by Little Hunting Park, Inc., his claim is limited solely to damages.\\nThe trial court denied relief to each petitioner. We reverse those judgments.\\nIn Jones v. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409, we reviewed at length the legislative history of 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1982.3 We concluded that it reaches beyond state action and operates upon the unofficial acts of private individuals and that it is authorized by the Enabling Clause of the Thirteenth Amendment. We said:\\n\u201cNegro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom\u2014 freedom to 'go and come at pleasure\u2019 and to \u2018buy and sell when they please\u2019 \u2014 would be left with \u2018a mere paper guarantee\u2019 if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands *236of a white man. At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep.\u201d 392 U. S., at 443.\\nThe Virginia trial court rested on its conclusion that Little Hunting Park was a private social club. But we find nothing of the kind on this record. There was no plan or purpose of exclusiveness. It is open to every white person within the geographic area, there being no selective element other than race. See Daniel v. Paul, 395 U. S. 298, 301-302. What we have here is a device functionally comparable to a racially restrictive covenant, the judicial enforcement of which was struck down in Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nIn Jones v. Mayer Co., the complaint charged a refusal to sell petitioner a home because he was black. In the instant case the interest conveyed was a leasehold of realty coupled with a membership share in a nonprofit company organized to offer recreational facilities to owners and lessees of real property in that residential area. It is not material whether the membership share be considered realty or personal property, as \u00a7 1982 covers both. Section 1982 covers the right \u201cto inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\u201d There is a suggestion that transfer on the books of the corporation of Freeman\u2019s share is not covered by any of those verbs. The suggestion is without merit. There has never been any doubt but that Freeman paid part of his $129 monthly rental for the *237assignment of the membership share in Little Hunting Park. The transaction clearly fell within the \u201clease.\u201d The right to \u201clease\u201d is protected by \u00a7 1982 against the actions of third parties, as well as against the actions of the immediate lessor. Respondents\u2019 actions in refusing to approve the assignment of the membership share in this case was clearly an interference with Freeman\u2019s right to \u201clease.\u201d A narrow construction of the language of \u00a7 1982 would be quite inconsistent with the broad and sweeping nature of the protection meant to be afforded by \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, from which \u00a7 1982 was derived. See 392 U. S., at 422-437.\\nWe turn to Sullivan\u2019s expulsion for the advocacy of Freeman\u2019s cause. If that sanction, backed by a state court judgment, can be imposed, then Sullivan is punished for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities protected by \u00a7 1982. Such a sanction would give impetus to the perpetuation of racial restrictions on property. That is why we said in Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249, 259, that the white owner is at times \u201cthe only effective adversary\u201d of the unlawful restrictive covenant. Under the terms of our decision in Barrows, there can be no question but that Sullivan has standing to maintain this action.\\nWe noted in Jones v. Mayer Co., that the Fair Housing Title of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 81, in no way impaired the sanction of \u00a7 1982. 392 U. S., at 413-417. What we said there is adequate to dispose of the suggestion that the public accommodations provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243, in some wTay supersedes the provisions of the 1866 Act. Fo,r the hierarchy of administrative machinery provided by the 1964 Act is not at war with survival of the principles embodied in \u00a7 1982. There is, moreover, a saving clause in the 1964 Act as respects \u201cany *238right based on any other Federal . . . law not inconsistent\u201d with that Act.4\\nSection 1982 derived from the 1866 Act is plainly \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d with the 1964 Act, which has been construed as not \u201cpre-empting every other mode of protecting a federal \u2018right\u2019 or as granting immunity\u201d to those who had long been subject to federal law. United States v. Johnson, 390 U. S. 563, 566.\\nWe held in Jones v. Mayer Co. that although \u00a7 1982 is couched in declaratory terms and provides no explicit method of enforcement, a federal court has power to fashion an effective equitable remedy. 392 U. S., at 414, n. 13. That federal remedy for the protection of a federal right is available in the state court, if that court is empowered to grant injunctive relief generally, as is the Virginia court. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 8-610 (1957 Repl. Vol.).\\nFinally, as to damages, Congress, by 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1343 (4), created federal jurisdiction for \u201cdamages or ... equitable or other relief under any Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights . . . .\u201d We reserved in Jones v. Mayer Co., 392 U. S., at 414-415, n. 14, the question of what damages, if any, might be appropriately recovered for a violation of \u00a7 1982.\\nWe had a like problem in Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, where suit was brought against federal officers for alleged *239violations of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The federal statute did not in terms at least provide any remedy. We said:\\n\u201c[W]here federally protected rights have been invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief. And it is also well settled that where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done.\u201d Id., at 684.\\nThe existence of a statutory right implies the existence of all necessary and appropriate remedies. See Texas &amp; N. O. R. Co. v. Railway Clerks, 281 U. S. 548, 569-570. As stated in Texas &amp; Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby, 241 U. S. 33, 39:\\n\u201cA disregard of the command of the statute is a wrongful act, and where it results in damage to one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted, the right to recover the damages from the party in default is implied . . . .\u201d\\nCompensatory damages for deprivation of a federal right are governed by federal standards, as provided by Congress in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988, which states:\\n\u201cThe jurisdiction in civil . . . matters conferred on the district courts by the provisions of this chapter and Title 18, for the protection of all persons in the United States in their civil rights, and for their vindication, shall be exercised and enforced in conformity with the laws of the United States, so far as such laws are suitable to carry the same into effect; but in all cases where they are not adapted to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary *240to furnish suitable remedies and punish offenses against law, the common law, as modified and changed by the constitution and statutes of the State wherein the court having jurisdiction of such civil or criminal cause is held, so far as the same is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, shall be extended to and govern the said courts in the trial and disposition of the cause . . .\\nThis means, as we read \u00a7 1988, that both federal and state rules on damages may be utilized, whichever better serves the policies expressed in the federal statutes. Cf. Brazier v. Cherry, 293 F. 2d 401. The rule of damages, whether drawn from federal or state sources, is a federal rule responsive to the need whenever a federal right is impaired. We do not explore the problem further, as the issue of damages was not litigated below.\\nIt is suggested, not by any party, but by the dissent, that any relief should await proceedings under the fair housing provisions of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. 82 Stat. 81, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 3601 et seq. (1964 ed., Supp. IV). But petitioners\u2019 suits were commenced on March 16, 1966, two years before that Act was passed. It would be irresponsible judicial administration to dismiss a suit because of an intervening Act5 which has no possible application to events long preceding its enactment.\\n\\nReversed.\\n\\n\\n Rule 5:1 which is entitled \u201cThe Record on Appeal\u201d states the following in \u00a7 3 (f):\\n\u201cSuch a transcript or statement not signed by counsel for all parties becomes part of the record when delivered to the clerk, if it is tendered to the judge within 60 days and signed at the end by him within 70 days after final judgment. It shall be forthwith delivered to the clerk who shall certify on it the date he receives it. Counsel tendering the transcript or statement shall give opposing counsel reasonable written notice of the time and place of tendering it and a reasonable opportunity to examine the original or a true copy of it. The signature of the judge, without more, will be deemed to be his certification that counsel had the required notice and opportunity, and that the transcript or statement is authentic.

E. 2d 251, appellants\u2019 counsel had delivered the transcript to appellees\u2019 counsel on November 24, 1965. The transcript was tendered to the trial judge on November 26, and was signed by him on December 3. Appellees moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that they had not been given \u201creasonable notice and opportunity\u201d under Rule 5:1. The court stated that the motion should be overruled on the ground that Rule 5:1 provides that \u201c[t]he signature of the judge, without more, will be deemed to be his certification that counsel had the required notice and opportunity, and that the transcript ... is authentic.\u201d The court noted that the judge\u2019s \u201csignature appears on the transcript without more and is, therefore, his certification that counsel for [appellees] had the required notice of tendering the transcript and the required opportunity to examine it.\u201d Id., at 797, 153 S. E. 2d, at 253.\\nIn Cook v. Virginia Holsum Bakeries, 207 Va. 815, 153 S. E. 2d 209, notice that the transcript would be tendered to the trial judge on *234October 20, 1965, was given to counsel for the appellee on October 15. Appellant\u2019s counsel, however, did not obtain a copy of the transcript until October 19. At a conference held on that same date, counsel for both parties went over the transcript and agreed on certain corrections and additions. At the hearing on October 20, appellee\u2019s counsel claimed he had not been given the reasonable notice and opportunity required by Rule 5:1. He then suggested numerous changes, and the trial judge ordered the transcript altered to reflect those changes. The revised transcript was tendered to the trial judge the next day, October 21, and signed by him that same day. On appeal, appellee moved to dismiss on the ground that the Rule 5:1 requirements had not been satisfied. The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals overruled the motion, stating: \u201cThe narrative was amended to meet the suggested changes of counsel for [appellee], and he conceded in oral argument before us that the statement signed by the trial judge was correct.\u201d Id., at 817, 153 S. E. 2d, at 210.\\n\\n\\n 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1982 provides:\\n\u201cAll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\u201d\\n\\n\\n Section 207 (b) of the Act of July 2, 1964, 78 Stat. 246, provides:\\n\u201cThe remedies provided in this title shall be the exclusive means of enforcing the rights based on this title, but nothing in this title shall preclude any individual or any State or local agency from asserting any right based on any other Federal or State law not inconsistent with this title, including any statute or ordinance requiring nondiscrimination in public establishments or accommodations, or from pursuing any remedy, civil or criminal, which may be available for the vindication or enforcement of such right.\u201d\\n\\n\\n The Act is not fully effective until December 31, 1969. 42 O'.

See \u00a7 3603 (b) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). So no one knows whether the new Act would apply to these ancient transactions, even if they arose after December 31, 1969.\\n\\n\", 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 9424129}, {'author_str': 'Harlan', 'per_curiam': False, 'type': '040dissent', 'page_count': None, 'download_url': None, 'author_id': None, 'opinion_text': '\\n*241Mr. Justice Harlan,\\nwith whom The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice White join,\\ndissenting.\\nIn Jones v. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409 (1968), the Court decided that a little-used section of a 100-year-old statute prohibited private racial discrimination in the sale of real property. This construction of a very old statute, in no way required by its language,1 and open to serious question in light of the statute\u2019s legislative history,2 seemed to me unnecessary and unwise because of the recently passed, but then not yet fully effective, Fair Housing Title of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (hereafter Fair Housing Law).3 Today, the Court goes yet beyond Jones (1) by implying a private right to damages for violations of 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1982; (2) by interpreting \u00a7 1982 to prohibit a community recreation association from withholding, on the basis of race, approval of an assignment of a membership that was transferred incident to a lease of real property; and (3) by deciding that a white person who is expelled from a recreation association \u201cfor the advocacy of [a Negro\u2019s] cause\u201d has \u201cstanding\u201d to maintain an action for relief under \u00a7 1982.\\nBecause the Fair Housing Law will become fully effective less than three weeks from now,4 I think the majority even more unwise than it was in Jones, in precipitately breathing still more life into \u00a7 1982, which is both vague and open-ended, when Congress has pro*242vided this modern statute, containing various detailed remedial provisions aimed at eliminating racial discrimination in housing. For this reason, which I elaborate in Part II, I would dismiss the writ in this case as improvidently granted. To provide examples of some of the difficulties the Court will inevitably encounter if it continues to employ \u00a7 1982 in these sorts of cases, I examine in Part III the undiscriminating manner in which the majority deals with, and for the most part ignores, the complexities involved in (1) giving Sullivan relief and (2) engrafting a damage remedy onto \u00a7 1982 in a case arising from a state court. But, first, I consider the threshold question of whether there is present in this case an adequate state ground which would bar review by this Court.\\nI\\nAdequacy of the State Ground\\nThe Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, both before and after this Court\u2019s earlier remand, refused to consider the federal questions presented to it because it found that petitioners had failed to give opposing counsel \u201creasonable written notice of the time and place of tendering the transcript and a reasonable opportunity to examine the original or a true copy of it,\u201d in violation of Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f), of the local rules of court.5 The majority here suggests that the State\u2019s procedural requirement, though not a \u201cnovel\u201d one \u201cfashioned ... for the first time in this case,\u201d nevertheless had not been \u201cso consistently applied ... as to amount to a self-denial of the power to entertain the federal claim.\u201d The majority then goes on to conclude that because the State\u2019s procedural rule is \u201cmore properly deemed discretionary than jurisdictional,\u201d review should not be barred here. *243I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that there is no adequate state ground shown, but I find myself unable to subscribe to the majority\u2019s reasoning, which appears to me unclear and confusing.\\nI am not certain what the majority means in its apparent distinction between rules that it deems \u201cdiscretionary\u201d and those that it deems \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d Perhaps the majority wishes to suggest that the dismissals of petitioners\u2019 writs of error by the Supreme Court of Appeals were simply ad hoc discretionary refusals to accept plenary review of the lower court\u2019s decisions, analogous to this Court\u2019s denial of certiorari. If this were all the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals had done, review of a federal question properly raised below would of course not be barred here. The mere discretionary refusal of the highest state court to grant review of a lower court decision does not provide an adequate state ground. In such circumstances, the decision of the lower court, rather than the order of the highest court refusing review, becomes the judgment, of the \u201chighest court of a State in which a decision could be had\u201d for purposes of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1257, our jurisdictional statute.6\\nBut this case clearly does not present this kind of discretionary refusal of a state appellate court to accept review. Although the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals may well have the \u201cdiscretion\u201d to refuse review7 in a particular case without giving reasons or reconciling its refusal with earlier decisions, the dismissal below was not simply an ad hoc exercise of the power not to review every case presented. Instead the state court dismissed the petitions for review for a stated reason, namely, a *244lack of \u201cjurisdiction to entertain the appeals because of the failure of counsel for the Sullivans and the Freemans to meet the requirements of Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f).\u201d When a state appellate court\u2019s refusal to consider the merits of a case is based on the failure to conform to a state rule of practice, review by this Court is barred unless this Court is able to find that application of the state rule of practice to the case at hand does not constitute an adequate state ground. This is so quite irrespective of whether the state appellate court had the power to refuse review for no reason at all.8\\nThe majority might have another meaning in mind when it describes the State\u2019s procedural rule as \u201cdiscretionary.\u201d It may be suggesting that \u201creasonable written notice,\u201d and \u201creasonable opportunity to examine\u201d are such flexible standards that the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has the \u201cdiscretion\u201d to decide a close case either of two ways without creating an obvious conflict with earlier decisions. If this is what the majority means by \u201cdiscretionary rule,\u201d then I must register my disagreement. This kind of \u201cdiscretion\u201d is nothing more than \u201cthe judicial formulation of law,\u201d for a court has an obligation to be reasonably consistent and \u201cto explain the decision, including the reason for according different treatment to the instant case.\u201d 9 Surely a state ground *245is no less adequate simply because it involves a standard that requires a judgment of what is reasonable, and because the result may turn on a close analysis of the facts of a particular case in light of competing policy considerations.\\nAlthough the majority\u2019s loose use of the word \u201cdiscretionary\u201d may suggest that any decision made pursuant to a broad standard cannot provide an adequate state ground, I think examination of the earlier opinions of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, several of which are cited by the majority, provides the proper foundation for the result reached by the majority, under the principle of NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S. 449 (1958).\\nThe finding of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals of a violation of Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f), in this case was in my view based on a standard of reasonableness much stricter than that which could have been fairly extracted from the earlier Virginia cases applying the rule10 and its predecessor statute.11 In other words, although Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f), itself may not be novel, the standard implicitly governing the rule\u2019s application to the facts here was. I think it fair to conclude that in light of these earlier decisions, and the principle set forth in Bacigalupo v. Fleming, 199 Va. 827, 835, 102 S. E. 2d 321, 326 (1958),12 the petitioners here might have justifiably\\n*246thought that review in the Supreme Court of Appeals would not be barred by the rule, notwithstanding Snead v. Commonwealth, 200 Va. 850, 108 S. E. 2d 399 (1959), the one case cited below by the Virginia court, relied on here by respondent and yet somehow ignored by the majority.13 Because \u201c[njovelty in procedural re*247quirements cannot be permitted to thwart review in this Court applied for by those who, in justified reliance upon prior decisions, seek vindication in state courts of their federal . . . rights,\u201d NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S., at 457-458, I conclude that the decision below does not rest on an adequate state ground.\\nII\\nBecause Congress has now provided a comprehensive scheme for dealing with the kinds of discrimination found in this case, I think it very unwise as a matter of policy for the Court to use \u00a7 1982 as a broad delegation of power to develop a common law of forbidden racial discriminations. A comparison of 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1982 with the new Fair Housing Law, and consideration of the Court\u2019s task in applying each, demonstrate to me the need for restraint, and the appropriateness of dismissing the writ in this case, now grounded solely on an alleged violation of \u00a7 1982.\\nPetitioners here complain of discrimination in the provision of recreation facilities ancillary to a rented house found in one of the four subdivisions served by Little Hunting Park. On the one hand, the Fair *248Housing Law has a provision that explicitly makes it unlawful to \u201cdiscriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of . . . rental [of housing] , or in the provisions of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race, [or] color . . . 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 3604 (b) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). (Emphasis added.) In contrast, as the majority in Jones noted, \u00a7 1982 \u201cdoes not deal specifically with discrimination in the provision of services or facilities in connection with the sale or rental of a dwelling,\u201d 392 U. S., at 413.\\nBy attempting to deal with the problem of discrimination in the provision of recreational facilities under \u00a7 1982, the Court is forced, in the context of a very vague statute, to decide what transactions involve \u201cproperty\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1982. The majority states that \u201c [i] t is not material whether the membership share [in Little Hunting Park] be considered realty or personal property, as \u00a7 1982 covers both.\u201d But examination of the opinion will show that the majority has failed to explain why the membership share is either real or personal property for purposes of \u00a7 1982. The majority\u2019s complete failure to articulate any standards for deciding what is property within the meaning of \u00a7 1982 is a fair indication of the great difficulties courts will inevitably confront if \u00a7 1982 is used to remedy racial discrimination in housing. And lurking in the background are grave constitutional issues should \u00a7 1982 be extended too far into some types of private discrimination.14\\nNot only does \u00a7 1982 fail to provide standards as to the types of transactions in which discrimination is unlawful, but it also contains no provisions for enforcement, either public or private. To give its construction of the statute effect, the Court has had to imply reme*249dies that Congress has not explicitly provided \u2014 injunc-tive relief in Jones, and now a right to damages here. See Part III, infra.\\nThese remedies are expressly provided for in the Fair Housing Law, which, with its variety of techniques for enforcing its prohibition of housing discrimination, again stands in sharp contrast with \u00a7 1982. First, an injured party can complain to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development who is empowered to investigate complaints, and use \u201cinformal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion\u201d to secure compliance with the law.15 Should the Secretary\u2019s efforts prove unavailing, the complainant can go to court.16 As an alternative to going first to HUD, it appears that a person may go directly to court to enforce his rights under the Fair Housing Law,17 which expressly provides for a wide variety of relief, including restraining orders, injunctions, compensatory damages, and punitive damages up to 81,000.18 Furthermore, the Act allows a court to appoint counsel and waive all fees for indigent plaintiffs, and to award costs and, in certain cases, counsel fees to a successful plaintiff.19 In addition to actions initiated by private parties, the Attorney General is empowered to bring civil actions for preventive civil relief, and criminal actions to punish those who by force or threat of force willfully interfere with or intimidate *250those who wish to exercise, or aid others in the exercise, of their rights under the Fair Housing Law.20\\nGiven this comprehensive, contemporary statute, the limitations of which have not yet even been established, I believe that the Court should not decide this case but should instead dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.21 This Court\u2019s certiorari jurisdiction should not be exercised simply \u201cfor the benefit of the particular litigants,\u201d Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery, 349 U. S. 70, 74 (1955), but instead for the \u201csettlement of [issues] of importance to the public as distinguished from . . . the parties,\u201d Layne &amp; Bowler Cory. v. Western Well Works, Inc., 261 U. S. 387, 393 (1923). Even from the perspective of the parties, this case has lost much of its practical importance due to the fact that Dr. Freeman\u2019s work has taken him and his family away from the area served by Little Hunting Park, thereby making moot his original claim for injunctive relief.22 But more fundamentally, I think here, as I did in Jones, that the existence of the Fair Housing Law.renders the decision of this case of little \u201cimportance to the public.\u201d For, although the 1968 Act does not cover this particular case,23 should a Negro in the future rent a house but be *251denied access to ancillary recreational facilities on account of race, he could in all likelihood secure relief under the provisions of the Fair Housing Law.24\\nIll\\nThe undiscriminating manner in which the Court has dealt with this case is both highlighted and compounded by the Court\u2019s failure to face, let alone resolve, two issues that lie buried beneath the surface of its opinion. Both issues are difficult ones, and the fact that the majority has not come to grips with them serves to illustrate the inevitable difficulties the Court will encounter if it continues to employ \u00a7 1982 as a means for dealing with the many subtle human problems that are bound to arise as the goal of eliminating discriminatory practices in our national life is pursued.\\nA. Relief foe Sullivan\\nBecause the majority opinion is highly elliptical as to (1) the circumstances surrounding Sullivan\u2019s expulsion from Little Hunting Park, (2) the relief Sullivan sought in the state court, and (3) the decision of the trial court, it is necessary for me to begin my analysis simply by stating the facts of these aspects of the case. A full *252examination of the record reveals, first, the necessity for a remand on the majority\u2019s own premises. It also makes apparent the majority\u2019s failure to provide any guidance as to the legal standards that should govern Sullivan\u2019s right to recovery on remand. An awareness of the complexity of the issues relevant to Sullivan\u2019s right to redress suggests further, I think, the appropriateness of a discretionary denial of review.\\n1. The Circumstances of Sullivan\u2019s Expulsion. After the Board of Little Hunting Park refused to approve the assignment of a membership share from Sullivan to Freeman, Sullivan attempted to convince the Board to reverse its decision. To this end, Sullivan first met with members of the Board, and protested their actions. He subsequently mobilized a campaign both by other members of the club and by persons in the community as a whole to force the Board to reconsider its decision. The means used in this campaign, as the brief for petitioner Sullivan acknowledges,25 included phone calls to members of the Board, letters to local clergy, and the circulation among the members of Little Hunting Park of a petition that called for a meeting of the full membership to consider Dr. Freeman\u2019s case.\\nOn July 8 Sullivan received a letter from the Board which stated that it had determined that there was \u201cdue cause\u201d to warrant a hearing in order to determine whether Sullivan should be expelled from Little Hunting Park, pursuant to its bylaws, for \u201cconduct inimicable to the Corporation members.\u201d This letter referred to Sullivan\u2019s \u201cnon-acceptance of the Board\u2019s decision on the assignment of your membership to your tenant . . . along with the continued harassment of the board members\u201d as the basis for the Board\u2019s \u201cdue cause\u201d determination.\\n*253The Board subsequently provided a detailed specification of its charges against Sullivan,26 and these included, inter alia, allegations that Sullivan had (a) instigated a campaign by which board members were harassed by \u201cunfriendly phone calls\u201d accusing them of bigotry; (b) used \u201cabusive\u201d language in a phone call to the president of the Board; (c) written letters to local clergy, including the minister of the church which employed the president of Little Hunting Park, accusing board members of participation in \u201creal moral evil\u201d; and (d) used \u201cviolent and abusive language\u201d to members of Little Hunting Park who had refused to sign his petition. After the hearing on these charges, the Board expelled Sullivan and tendered to him the current market value of the two membership shares that he held.\\nIn response to these actions, Sullivan brought this suit in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, against Little Hunting Park and its Board seeking as relief (1) an order compelling Little Hunting Park to reinstate his membership; (2) monetary damages in the amount of $15,000; and (3) an injunction requiring the Board to approve the assignment to Freeman and forbidding the Board to use race as a factor in considering membership. The trial court, after hearing disputed evidence as to the reasons for Sullivan\u2019s expulsion, found for the defendants. It stated that the *254scope of its review of the Board\u2019s actions was \u201climited\u201d because Little Hunting Park was a \u201cprivate and social\u201d club, and then went on to find that the Board had acted within \u201cthe powers conferred on it by the By-Laws\u201d in \u2022expelling Sullivan, and that \u201cthere was ample evidence to justify [the Board\u2019s] conclusion that the complainant\u2019s acts were inimicable to the Corporation\u2019s members and to the Corporation.\u201d\\n2. With this statement of the record in mind, several observations must be made about the majority\u2019s treatment of Sullivan\u2019s rights. First, in stating that \u201cSullivan\u2019s expulsion [was] for the advocacy of Freeman\u2019s cause,\u201d the majority surely cannot be taken to have resolved disputed testimony, and decided the facts underlying Sullivan\u2019s expulsion. If these facts are relevant to Sullivan\u2019s remedial rights, as surely they must be, then a remand for detailed findings seems unavoidable under the majority\u2019s own premises.\\nSecond, the majority has not explained what legal standard should determine Sullivan\u2019s rights under \u00a7 1982. The majority simply states that \u201cSullivan has standing to maintain this action\u201d under \u00a7 1982, without even acknowledging that some standard is essential for this case to be ultimately decided.\\nOne can imagine a variety of standards, each based on different legal conclusions as to the \u201crights\u201d and \u201cduties\u201d created by \u00a7 1982, and each having very different remedial consequences. For example, does \u00a7 1982 give Sullivan a right to relief only for injuries resulting from Little Hunting Park\u2019s interference with his statutory duty to Freeman under \u00a7 1982? If so, what is Sullivan\u2019s duty to Freeman under \u00a7 1982? Unless \u00a7 1982 is read to impose a duty on Sullivan to protest Freeman\u2019s exclusion, he would be entitled to reinstatement under this standard only if the Board had expelled him for the simple act of assigning his share to Freeman.\\n*255As an alternative, Sullivan might be thought to be entitled to relief from those injuries that flowed from the Board\u2019s violation of its \u201cduty\u201d to Freeman under \u00a7 1982. Such a standard might suggest that Sullivan is entitled to damages that resulted from Little Hunting Park\u2019s initial refusal to accept the assignment to Freeman but again not to reinstatement. Or does the Court think that \u00a7 1982 gives Sullivan a right to relief from injuries that result from his \u201clegitimate\u201d protest aimed at convincing the Board to accept Freeman? If so, what protest activities were legitimate here? Most extreme would be a standard that would give Sullivan relief from injuries that were the result of any actions he took to protest the Board\u2019s initial refusal, irrespective of Sullivan\u2019s means of protest. Only this standard would require reinstatement, irrespective of the disputed facts here. But this standard would mean that \u00a7 1982 gave Sullivan a right to regain his membership even if the Board has expelled him for using intemperate and abusive threats as a means of protesting Freeman\u2019s exclusion.27\\nB. State Court Remedies for Federal Rights\\nBecause this case arises from a state court, it presents special problems which the majority overlooks, and which suggests again the undesirability of deciding this case in the context of this ancient statute. In deciding that there is a right to recover damages in this case, the majority overlooks the complications involved by dint of the fact that a state court is being asked to provide *256a remedy for a federal right bottomed on a federal statute that itself has no remedial provisions.\\nImplied remedies for federal rights are sometimes solely a matter of federal law28 and other times dependent, either wholly or partially, upon state law.29 Difficult and complex questions are involved in determining what remedies a state court must30 or must not31 provide in cases involving federal rights.32\\nIt should be noted that the majority\u2019s opinion, though perhaps deciding very little33 only adds to the confusion already existing in this area. Section 1988 of Title 42, which the majority apparently thinks decides this case, is concerned with the remedial powers of federal district courts and it provides that the federal courts shall look to state law to find appropriate remedies when the applicable federal civil rights law is \u201cdeficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies . . . .\u201d But the majority turns this provision on its head by suggesting (1) that \u00a7 1988 creates a federal remedy, apart from state law, when the remedial provisions of a civil rights statute, like \u00a7 1982, are \u201cdeficient\u201d; and (2) that \u00a7 1988 itself somehow imposes this federal remedy on the States. *257If \u00a7 1988 says anything at all relevant for this case, it suggests that in those cases where it is appropriate to cure remedial deficiencies of a federal civil rights statute by implication, this is to be done by looking to state law to see what remedies, consistent with federal policies, would be available there.\\nBy reason of these considerations, many of which could hardly have been foreseen at the time certiorari was granted, I would dismiss the writ in this case as improvidently granted.\\n\\n 392 U.

In this case, opposing counsel received notice by telephone on Friday, June 9, and by letter the following Monday. His opportunity to examine the transcript consisted of the time between Monday and Friday when the transcript was available to him in the judge\u2019s chambers; and the time between Friday, June 16, and Monday, the 19th, when he actually had in his possession a copy of the transcript. Any argument that this length of time, per se, is not reasonable opportunity is belied by Cook v. Virginia Holsum Bakeries, supra, where opposing counsel received a copy of a narrative only two days before the trial judge signed it, and the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals found no violation of the rule.\\n\\n\\n In Snead, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals said:\\n\u201cIt is important that time be given opposing counsel for a reasonable opportunity to analyze such statements characterized by defendant\u2019s counsel as being confusing. The entire testimony of a very material witness was left out of the narrative statement when it was presented to the trial judge and it was necessary for him to insert it. We are of the opinion that the notice delivered to the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney at his residence, after office hours, thirty minutes before tendering a narrative statement of the evidence to the trial judge for his signature, does not constitute reasonable notice within the plain meaning of Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3 (f) and that the terms of the Rule are mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d 200 Va., at 854, 108 S. E. 2d, at 402.\\nThis case is far different from Snead in significant respects. First, in Snead the court was not confronted with a transcript but instead with a narrative; and this narrative was, by the admission of appellant\u2019s own counsel, \u201cof a confusing nature and character.\u201d In this case, on the other hand, the record fails to show that counsel for respondent made any objection to the trial judge as to the adequacy of the notice, or to the accuracy of the transcript, see Taylor v. Wood, supra; Stokely v. Owens, supra. Furthermore, at oral argument before this Court, counsel for respondent could not point to a single inaccuracy in the transcript as signed by the *247trial judge. Tr. of Oral Arg. 20. Second, in Snead opposing counsel was only given one-half hour\u2019s notice of a proposed tender to the judge for signature that night. In this ease, although the transcript was sent to the judge at about the same time as opposing counsel received notice, that notice stated that the judge would not be asked to sign the transcript for a week, so counsel could first have an opportunity to examine it.\\nRespondent suggests that the rule requires that opposing counsel have notice and an opportunity to examine the transcript before the transcript is given to the judge rather than simply before the judge signs it. No prior Virginia case of which we have been made aware has so stated, however, and the principle of Bacigalupo quoted by the majority suggests that the key is that there be an opportunity to inspect and to make objections before the judge signs the transcript.\\n\\n\\n See Civil Rights Cases, 109 TJ.

In this case, an unpaid vendor sought to dissolve sales of movable property after the original purchaser had resold the movables to a third party in good faith. We hold, under these circumstances, that the vendor\\'s exercising its right of dissolution could not impair the third party\\'s rights in the movables. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\\'s judgment and remand this case for further proceedings.\\n    \\n    I. BACKGROUND\\n    \\n      2\\n      Sugarland Motor Company (\"Sugarland\") owns and operates motor vehicle dealerships in Plaquemine, Louisiana. Those dealerships originate retail installment contracts (\"RICs\") when they sell vehicles on credit. By executing an RIC, the buyer grants a security interest in his new vehicle to secure his obligation to pay the financed portion of the vehicle\\'s purchase price. Thus, each contract includes the buyer\\'s promise to pay the amount financed plus daily accruing finance charges and a security agreement creating a security interest in the vehicle in favor of Sugarland and its assignees. Immediately after a credit sale is complete, Sugarland assigns the RIC to a consumer finance company.1 By this point the finance company has already verified the buyer\\'s creditworthiness and agreed to pay Sugarland the financed portion of the price. The buyer then makes monthly payments to the finance company or its assignee.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Argo Financial, Inc. (\"Argo\"), was a finance company that Sugarland dealt with on a regular basis. When it sold an RIC to Argo, Sugarland would send the original contract to Argo by overnight delivery. Argo usually mailed a check to Sugarland for the full amount financed five to ten days after receiving the RIC. After receiving the payment from Argo, Sugarland would submit a copy of the RIC and a title application for the vehicle described in the RIC to the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Office of Motor Vehicles (\"OMV\" or \"Louisiana OMV\"). Under Louisiana law, a security interest in the vehicle would be perfected upon the OMV\\'s receipt of the RIC.2 The OMV would then issue a certificate of title showing Argo as the vehicle\\'s \"first lienholder,\" and Sugarland would send the certificate to Argo. Argo, in turn, would resell the RIC to another finance company &#8212; in this case, Advanta Auto Finance Corporation (\"Advanta\"). When Argo received a title certificate for a vehicle associated with an RIC that it had sold to Advanta, Argo would forward the certificate to Advanta along with the documents necessary for Advanta to have a new certificate issued noting its security interest in the vehicle.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Two RICs originated by Sugarland are at issue here. Maudria Fox executed the first one on September 29, 1998; Susan and Stephen Kennard (collectively \"Kennard\") executed the second on October 2, 1998. In each instance, Sugarland sold and delivered the RIC to Argo. But Sugarland did not receive payment from Argo within the customary time frame. After giving several assurances that payment was forthcoming, Argo finally advised Sugarland that it had filed for bankruptcy, that it was therefore unable to fund the RICs, and that Sugarland needed either to get the vehicles back from Fox and Kennard or to finance the sales with another lender.3 In the meantime, however, Argo had sold and delivered the RICs to Advanta.4 Unaware that Sugarland had not received payment, Advanta promptly paid Argo the agreed-upon purchase price for each RIC.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      After learning that Argo was in bankruptcy, Sugarland informed Fox and Kennard that they needed to switch lenders and convinced them to execute new RICs. Although Fox and Kennard had each made one payment to Advanta when they executed the new RICs, Sugarland claims it was unaware that Advanta had purchased the original contracts from Argo. Sugarland immediately sold the new contracts to Americredit Financial Services, Inc. (\"Americredit\"), and filed the appropriate documents with the Louisiana OMV. In due course, the OMV issued title certificates showing Americredit as the first lienholder of the Fox and Kennard vehicles. Fox and Kennard then quit making payments to Advanta under the terms of the original RICs and began paying Americredit instead.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Because it never received payment from Argo, Sugarland never filed with the OMV copies of the original RICs or title applications requesting that Argo\\'s security interest be noted on each vehicle\\'s title certificate. It follows that neither Argo nor Advanta ever received title certificates for the Fox and Kennard vehicles. Because Sugarland forwarded the title certificates it actually applied for and received to Americredit, Advanta was never able to obtain new certificates noting its security interests in the vehicles.5 Thus, although Advanta is still in possession of the original RICs, its security interests in the Fox and Kennard vehicles are unperfected.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      In this adversary proceeding related to Argo\\'s bankruptcy, Advanta brought a conversion claim against Sugarland, alleging that Sugarland interfered with or destroyed its right to payment under the original RICs by enticing Fox and Kennard to execute new contracts. Relying on Louisiana Civil Code articles 2561, 2013, and 2016, Sugarland answered that it was not liable to Advanta in tort or otherwise because Argo\\'s failure to pay the purchase prices entitled it to regard the sales of the RICs to Argo as dissolved. The general effect of dissolution is to restore the seller and the buyer to the situation that existed before the sale; thus, Sugarland maintained that the rights in the RICs that Advanta acquired from Argo did not survive the dissolution of the initial sales. Advanta responded that its rights as the owner of the original RICs were governed by Chapter 9 of the Louisiana Commercial Laws (\"Chapter 9\"), Louisiana\\'s version of U.C.C. Article 9,6 and were superior to any rights and remedies that Sugarland may have had under the Louisiana Civil Code as a result of Argo\\'s nonpayment of the purchase prices.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      This matter went to trial in the bankruptcy court on the stipulated facts appearing in the parties\\' pretrial order.7 In its \"Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in a Non-Core Proceeding,\" the bankruptcy court recommended that the district court enter judgment in favor of Advanta. The bankruptcy court rejected Sugarland\\'s argument that it was entitled to regard the sales of the RICs to Argo as dissolved, reasoning that \"Advanta, as the holder of a security interest governed by [Chapter 9], has an interest in the RICs that is superior to any right Sugarland may have under the Civil Code.\" Despite this rejection of Sugarland\\'s defense to Advanta\\'s conversion claim, the bankruptcy court did not consider the merits of that claim. The court based its recommendation instead on a breach of warranty theory that it raised sua sponte. In the \"Assignment by Seller\" section of the RICs, Sugarland warranted that it would \"perfect a security interest in the Property in favor of [Argo].\" The court found that Sugarland breached this warranty by not submitting to the Louisiana OMV copies of the original RICs along with title applications requesting that Argo\\'s security interests in the Fox and Kennard vehicles be noted on the respective title certificates. Further finding that Argo\\'s rights vested in Advanta by subrogation, the court concluded that Sugarland was liable to Advanta for breach of warranty.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      Sugarland filed objections to the bankruptcy court\\'s proposed conclusions of law. The district court maintained those objections, reasoning that although Sugarland warranted that it would perfect security interests in the Fox and Kennard vehicles in favor of Argo, \"[i]t did not ... warrant that it would do so prior to being paid.\" Contrary to the bankruptcy court\\'s proposed conclusion, the district court determined that \"[n]othing in Chapter 9 displaces the general principle of Louisiana law ... that a seller may deem a contract dissolved if the buyer fails to pay the agreed-upon purchase price.\" The court then found that Argo\\'s nonpayment of the purchase prices entitled Sugarland to regard the sales of the RICs to Argo as dissolved and concluded that, as a consequence of dissolution, \"any purported assignment of Argo\\'s rights to Advanta was ineffectual.\" In accordance with this conclusion, the district court entered a final judgment dismissing Advanta\\'s claim against Sugarland. This appeal followed.\\n    \\n    II. ANALYSIS\\n    \\n      10\\n      Because the facts of this case are undisputed and the district court\\'s decision rests solely on a conclusion of law, our review is de novo.8\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      In Louisiana, an unpaid vendor has the right to demand dissolution of a sale made on credit.9 Louisiana Civil Code article 2561 provides, in part, that \"[i]f the buyer fails to pay the price, the seller may sue for dissolution of the sale.\"10 This substantive right of dissolution is clearly distinguishable from the privilege that the vendor has on the thing sold for the payment of the purchase price: \"Exercise of the vendor\\'s privilege involves an assertion of the sale; in contrast, exercise of the vendor\\'s right of dissolution involves a repudiation of the sale and its consequences.\"11\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Although Article 2561 speaks only of judicial dissolution, the Civil Code specifies other means of dissolution that may be available to an unpaid vendor.12 In certain cases in which an obligor has failed to perform, Article 2013 of the Civil Code permits the obligee to regard the contract as dissolved instead of filing suit.13 Article 2016 describes the general circumstances under which the obligee can take such unilateral action without first serving the obligor with a notice to perform: \"When a delayed performance would no longer be of value to the obligee or when it is evident that the obligor will not perform, the obligee may regard the contract as dissolved without any notice to the obligor.\"14 Applying these principles to the contract of sale, it becomes clear that extrajudicial dissolution is available in cases in which the buyer has advised the seller that he cannot or will not perform his obligation to pay the purchase price.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Because Argo had advised Sugarland that it was in bankruptcy and was therefore unable to pay the purchase prices for the Fox and Kennard RICs, the district court found that Sugarland was entitled to regard the sales of the RICs to Argo as dissolved. Although Advanta disputes this finding, its principal argument is that Chapter 9 of the Louisiana Commercial Laws, and not the Civil Code articles on dissolution, controls the outcome of this case.15 The ultimate merit of this argument hinges on whether Sugarland\\'s right of dissolution conflicts with Advanta\\'s rights under Chapter 9.16 Fortunately, we need not decide today whether such a conflict exists, for we agree with Advanta\\'s alternative argument &#8212; grounded in the Louisiana Civil Code &#8212; that even if Sugarland was entitled to regard the sales of the RICs to Argo as dissolved, dissolution could not impair the rights that Advanta acquired from Argo in good faith.17\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Because dissolution restores the parties to the situation that existed before they entered the contract of sale,18 problems arise when the property sold is no longer in the hands of the original purchaser. In such cases, the availability of dissolution and its effect on the rights that a third party has acquired has long depended on whether the sale involves movable or immovable property.19 In Robertson v. Buoni, the Louisiana Supreme Court reviewed over a century of jurisprudence and observed that the \"right to dissolution of a sale of an immovable for nonpayment is not contingent on the absence of a third party purchaser. A vendor seeking dissolution of the sale may do so even after the property has left the hands of the original purchaser.\"20 On the other hand, courts have held that the unpaid vendor of a movable can exercise the right of dissolution \"only so long as the movable remains in the possession of the original vendee.\"21\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      According to Professor Yiannopoulos, the application of different rules to movables and immovables reflects that transactions involving the former are generally not protected by a system of public records:22 \"Immovable property has been protected by the law much more effectively than movable property; and, whereas security of acquisition of immovables is achieved by the system of public records, security of transaction and acquisition of movables is enhanced by the bona fide purchaser doctrine.\"23 Thus, it is in the interest of security of transactions that the vendor\\'s right of dissolution \"becomes inoperative against third possessors of movables.\"24\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      The Louisiana Legislature had this interest in mind when it enacted Civil Code article 2021 as part of the 1984 revision of the law of obligations. That article provides: \"Dissolution of a contract does not impair the rights acquired through an onerous contract by a third party in good faith. If the contract involves immovable property, the principles of recordation apply.\"25 Where credit sales of movables are concerned, Article 2021 is consistent with the earlier jurisprudential rule that the unpaid vendor cannot exercise his right of dissolution if the movables sold are no longer in the possession of the original purchaser.26 Although the courts\\' focus was on whether the vendor could \"exercise\" his right of dissolution, and Article 2021 assumes the dissolution and addresses its consequences, the end result is the same: the third party retains the rights he has acquired. We therefore find it clearly established under Louisiana law that the exercise of the vendor\\'s right of dissolution does not impair the rights in movable property that a third party has acquired through an onerous contract in good faith.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      In this case, Advanta undoubtedly acquired its rights in the RICs through an onerous contract with Argo.27 Furthermore, Sugarland does not dispute that Advanta acquired those rights in good faith. Because the record indicates that Advanta paid reasonable prices for the RICs and was not aware of Argo\\'s nonpayment, we find that Advanta stands in the position of a good faith purchaser.28 We therefore conclude that even if Sugarland was entitled to regard the sales of the RICs to Argo as dissolved, dissolution of the sales could not impair the rights that Advanta acquired from Argo, which include the right to receive payments under the terms of the RICs.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Accordingly, we hold that the district court\\'s dismissal of Advanta\\'s conversion claim on the basis of the vendor\\'s right of dissolution was erroneous. Because the district court did not consider the merits of that claim, we find it appropriate to remand this case so that it may do so in the first instance.29\\n    \\n    III.

To facilitate application of Louisiana law, we generally refer to the transactions at issue in this case as sales rather than assignments.\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         See La.R.S. 10:9-501(a)(1); see also La.R.S. 32:710(A) (\"A security interest covering a titled motor vehicle ... shall be perfected as of the time the financing statement is received by the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, so long as such receipt subsequently is validated by the secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections.\"). Because the RICs that Sugarland originates provide the name of the buyer (the debtor), the name of the seller (the secured party), and a description of the motor vehicle purchased (an indication of the collateral covered by the security agreement), the contracts satisfy the formal requirements for a financing statement. See La.R.S. 10:9-502(a), 10:9-504(3); see also David Willenzik, Louisiana Secured Transactions &#167; 6:14, at 6-16 to 6-17 (West 2002) (\"Certain lenders choose to file a copy of the borrower\\'s UCC security agreement (rather than a UCC-1 financing statement) in connection with indirect dealer credit sales transactions (particularly those involving motor vehicles).... Generally, it is viewed to be easier and less cumbersome for a dealer to require its customers to sign combination retail installment sales contract forms, which include UCC security agreement covenants, and then to file such contract forms with the appropriate filing officer.\").\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Argo filed a Chapter 7 petition on November 3, 1998, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         The sales preceded Argo\\'s bankruptcy filing by less than one month\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         See La.R.S. 32:710(E).\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         See La.R.S. 10:9-101 to 10:9-710.\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         Sugarland did not consent to the entry of final judgment by the bankruptcy court in this non-core \"related to\" proceeding.

Although Article 2561 appears in the title on Sale, the first article of that title provides that \"[i]n all matters for which no special provision is made in this title, the contract of sale is governed by the rules of the titles on Obligations in General and Conventional Obligations or Contracts.\" La. Civ.Code art. 2438. Thus, the general articles on contract dissolution govern the vendor\\'s right of dissolution in the absence of a special provision applicable to sales. See La. Civ.Code. art. 2561 cmt. (i) (citing La. Civ.Code arts. 2013-2024); see also La. Civ. Code. art. 2564 cmt.

La.R.S. 10:1-103 (\"Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Title, the other laws of Louisiana shall apply.\").\\n      \\n      \\n        17\\n         We note, however, that the district court\\'s conclusion that the vendor\\'s right of dissolution does not conflict with any specific provision of Chapter 9 finds support in the writings of Louisiana\\'s leading property law scholarSee Yiannopoulos, supra note 9, &#167; 233, at 468 n. 10 (4th ed. 2001 &amp; Supp. 2002) (\"The vendor\\'s right of dissolution is not affected by Chapter 9, and it would seem that this right primes a later security interest.\").\\n      \\n      \\n        18\\n         See La. Civ.Code art. 2018.\\n      \\n      \\n        19\\n         In Louisiana, movables are a residual category of things. Yiannopoulos,supra note 9, &#167; 148, at 342. Article 475 of the Civil Code provides that \"[a]ll things, corporeal or incorporeal, that the law does not consider as immovables, are movables.\" La. Civ.Code art. 475. As this provision suggests, the law recognizes two kinds of immovables: corporeal immovables and incorporeal immovables. \"Corporeal immovables are tracts of land with their component parts, such as buildings, other constructions permanently attached to the ground, standing timber, and unharvested crops or ungathered fruits of trees.\" Yiannopoulos, supra note 9, &#167; 113, at 264 (citing La. Civ.Code arts. 462, 463). Incorporeal immovables are rights and actions that have an immovable object; this category includes personal servitudes, predial servitudes, mineral rights, and petitory or possessory actions. Id. (citing La. Civ.Code art. 470). Because the RICs at issue in this case do not fall within either category of immovables, they are movables as a matter of law.\\n      \\n      \\n        20\\n         504 So.2d 860, 863 (La. 1987) (citingStevenson v.

Civ.Code art. 2021See generally Shael Herman, Detrimental Reliance in Louisiana Law &#8212; Past, Present, and Future (?): The Code Drafter\\'s Perspective, 58 Tul. L. Rev. 707, 752 (1984) (explaining that Article 2021 reflects an effort to \"broadly articulate the principle of protection of the bona fide purchaser of both movables and immovables who acquires rights by onerous contract in reliance upon either the public records (in the case of immovables) or the transferor\\'s apparent authority to transfer (in the case of movables)\").\\n      \\n      \\n        26\\n         According to the revision comment, Article 2021 expresses a principle implied in Article 3229 of the Civil CodeSee La. Civ.Code art. 2021 cmt. Article 3229, which applies only to cash sales of movables, provides that an unpaid seller can \"claim back the things in kind, which were thus sold, as long as they are in possession of the purchaser, and prevent the resale of them; provided the claim for restitution be made within eight days of the delivery at farthest, and that the identity of the objects be established.\" La. Civ.Code art. 3229 (emphasis added). Before the enactment of Article 2021, courts that held that the right of dissolution could be exercised only so long as the movable sold on credit remained in the possession of the original purchaser did so by analogy to Article 3229. See Yiannopoulos, supra note 9, &#167; 233, at 468.\\n      \\n      \\n        27\\n         See La.

In fact, Advanta maintains in its briefs that its only cause of action against Sugarland is for tortious conversion under Louisiana law. Thus, the district court should not reconsider the bankruptcy court\\'s recommendation on remand\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      EMILIO M. GARZA, Circuit Judge, specially concurring:\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      I agree with the majority opinion that the district court\\'s dismissal of Advanta\\'s conversion claim on the basis of the vendor\\'s right of dissolution was erroneous. However, I cannot agree with the majority opinion that, to resolve this matter, we need only look to the Louisiana Civil Code (the \"Civil Code\"). On the contrary, Chapter 9 of the Louisiana Commercial Laws (\"Chapter 9\"), Louisiana\\'s version of UCC Article 9, controls the outcome of this case. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment only.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      The majority opinion attempts to avoid the question at hand &#8212; whether Sugarland\\'s rights under Articles 2013, 2016, and 2549 of the Civil Code, providing that a seller may, on its own initiative and without judicial authorization, deem a contract dissolved if the buyer fails to pay the agreed-upon purchase price,1 conflict with Advanta\\'s rights as a good faith purchaser of chattel paper under the particular provisions of Chapter 9 dealing with sales of chattel paper and the priority of a chattel paper purchaser. To avoid answering this question, the majority opinion reasons that, under Article 2021 of the Civil Code, Advanta retains the rights in the RICs it acquired from Argo even if Sugarland was entitled to regard the assignment agreement between Sugarland and Argo as dissolved. The problem with this reasoning is that Article 2021 simply cannot apply where, as here, the contract at issue was never dissolved. Article 2021 provides that \"[d]issolution of a contract does not impair the rights acquired through an onerous contract by a third party in good faith.\" La. Civ.Code Art.2021 (emphasis added). From its plain text it is clear that, for Article 2021 to apply, there must first be a dissolved contract.2 However, contrary to Sugarland\\'s contention, the assignment agreement at issue in this case &#8212; a credit sale between Sugarland and Argo &#8212; was never dissolved. Even though Articles 2013, 2016, and 2549 of the Civil Code generally permit a seller (such as Sugarland), on its own initiative and without judicial authorization, to deem a contract dissolved if a buyer (such as Argo) fails to pay the agreed-upon purchase price, the specific provisions of Chapter 9 dealing with sales of chattel paper and the priority of a chattel paper purchaser (discussed below) precluded Sugarland from unilaterally and extrajudicially dissolving the assignment agreement between it and Argo once Advanta had already purchased the RICs from Argo in good faith.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      In the context of this case, the specific provisions of Chapter 9 not only protect Advanta\\'s ownership interest in the RICs against the competing claims of Argo\\'s creditors, including Sugarland, but also displace the more general Civil Code provisions, found at Articles 2013, 2016, and 2549, addressing a seller\\'s ability to unilaterally and extrajudicially deem a contract dissolved if the buyer fails to pay the agreed-upon purchase price. Under Chapter 9, the assignment agreement between Sugarland and Argo was a \"true sale\" of chattel paper, passing title in the RICs to Argo. See La. R.S. 10:9-109(e) (providing that the parties\\' characterization of a transaction as a sale of chattel paper is conclusive that the transaction is a \"true sale\" and that title has passed to the party characterized as the purchaser, regardless of any other term of the parties\\' agreement); La. R.S. 10:9-318(a) (providing that a seller of chattel paper retains no legal or equitable interest in the chattel paper sold).3 And, by paying for and taking possession of the RICs from Argo, Advanta perfected a Chapter 9 security interest in the RICs, thereby protecting its rights in the chattel paper from the competing rights of Argo\\'s creditors, including Sugarland.4 Even assuming, arguendo, that Sugarland acquired a security interest in the RICs,5 Sugarland failed to perfect its security interest by retaining possession of the RICs pending Argo\\'s payment or by filing a UCC-1 financing statement. See La. R.S. 10:9-313(a) (\"possession\" perfection of a security interest in chattel paper); La. R.S. 10:9-312(a) (\"filing\" perfection of a security interest in chattel paper). Thus, Advanta\\'s perfected security interest in the RICs trumps any unperfected security interest Sugarland might have acquired. See La. R.S. 10:9-322(a)(2) (perfected security interest has priority over an unperfected security interest of a competing creditor).6 Because these particular provisions of Chapter 9 specifically address the sale of chattel paper and the priority of a good faith purchaser\\'s rights in the purchased chattel paper over the competing claims of the seller\\'s creditors, they displace &#8212; in this context &#8212; the more general provisions of the Civil Code, found at Articles 2013, 2016, and 2549, providing that a seller may, on its own initiative and without judicial authorization, deem a contract dissolved if the buyer fails to pay the agreed-upon purchase price. See La. R.S. 10:1-103 (\"Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Title, the other laws of Louisiana shall apply.\"); La. R.S. 9:3192 (providing that, \"[i]n the case of conflict between the provisions of Title VII of Book III of the Civil Code, governing sales and any provisions of any special legislation, such as those contained in Titles 9 and 10 [the Louisiana UCC] of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950 ... the latter shall prevail with regard to transactions subject thereto.\").7 Thus, Sugarland can not now claim that, even though Advanta purchased the RICs from Argo in good faith, Sugarland was entitled to unilaterally and extrajudicially deem the assignment agreement between it and Argo to be dissolved simply because Argo failed to pay it the agreed-upon purchase price.8\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      For the foregoing reasons, I cannot agree with the majority opinion that, under Article 2021 of the Civil Code, Advanta retains the rights in the RICs that it acquired from Argo even if Sugarland was entitled to regard the assignment agreement between it and Argo as dissolved. Chapter 9 governs whether the assignment of RICs between Sugarland and Argo was effectual, and its specific provisions dealing with sales of chattel paper and the priority of a chattel paper purchaser precluded Sugarland from extrajudicially and unilaterally dissolving the assignment agreement between it and Argo once Advanta had already purchased the RICs from Argo in good faith.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        Notes:\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         See La. Civ.Code Art. 2013 (\"When the obligor fails to perform, the obligee has a right to the judicial dissolution of the contract or, according to the circumstances, to regard the contract as dissolved. In either case, the obligee may recover damages. In an action involving judicial dissolution, the obligor who failed to perform may be granted, according to the circumstances, an additional time to perform.\"); La. Civ.Code Art. 2016 (\"When a delayed performance would no longer be of value to the obligee or when it is evident that the obligor will not perform, the obligee may regard the contract as dissolved without any notice to the obligor.\"); La. Civ.Code Art. 2549 (\"The buyer is bound to pay the price and to take delivery of the thing.\").\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         As the majority opinion correctly acknowledges, Article 2021 \"assumes the dissolution and addresses its consequences.\"\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Both parties agree that the RICs in question are \"chattel paper\" under Chapter 9 of the Louisiana UCCSee La. R.S. 10:9-102(a)(11) (defining \"chattel paper\" as \"a record or records that evidence both a monetary obligation and a security interest in specific goods....\").\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         Sugarland became Argo\\'s creditor by virtue of its agreement to assign the RICs to Argo on a deferred payment basis, a transaction that is treated as a completed credit sale under Louisiana lawSee Succession of Dunham, 408 So.2d 888, 896-97 (La.1981) (explaining that, under Louisiana law, a conditional sale is treated as a completed credit sale, \"in which ownership of the object of the sale passes at the time the contract is entered into\"); see also In re Wallace Lincoln-Mercury, 469 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1972) (\"`[U]nder Lousiana law, a conditional sale whereby title is retained in the vendor is legally impossible, so the courts respect the contract but ignore the provision retaining title in the vendor.\\'\") (quoting Morelock v. Morgan &amp; Bird Gravel Co., 174 La. 658, 141 So. 368, 374 (1932)). As a result of this credit sale, Argo acquired rights in the RICs that are enforceable under Chapter 9 of the Louisiana UCC. See La. R.S. 10:9-109(e); La. R.S. 10:9-318(a). Likewise, when Advanta purchased the RICs from Argo, Advanta acquired rights in the RICs that are enforceable under Chapter 9. See La. R.S. 10:9-109(e); La. R.S. 10:9-318(a). As a good faith purchaser of the RICs, Advanta perfected its security interest in the RICs by taking possession of the signed originals, which were delivered to Advanta by Argo. See La. R.S. 10:9-313(a) (providing for \"possession\" perfection of a security interest in chattel paper).\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         Arguably, the understanding between Sugarland and Argo, which made the initial sale of the RICs contingent upon Argo\\'s payment of the purchase price, amounts to Argo\\'s grant to Sugarland of a UCC security interest in the purchased RICs. Under La. R.S. 10:1-201(37), a seller\\'s reservation of title to, or rights in, the purchased personal (movable) property, conditioned on the buyer\\'s payment of the purchase price, may amount to the grant of an Chapter 9 security interest. However, as explained above, the transaction at issue was a \"true sale\" of chattel paper transferring title in the RICs to Argo under La.R.S. 10:9-109(e)\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         According to Sugarland, the enforceability of Advanta\\'s security interest in the RICs depends on the enforceability of the underlying principal obligation, since a security interest is generally considered to be an \"accessory\" obligation under the Louisiana Civil Code. On the contrary, the security interest of a chattel paper purchaser is not an \"accessory\" obligation, since it does not secure a debt or performance obligationSee La. Civ.Code. art. 1913 (\"A contract is accessory when it is made to provide security for the performance of an obligation. Suretyship, mortgage, pledge, and other types of security agreements are examples of such a contract.\"). Rather than securing a debt or performance obligation, a sale of chattel paper transfers title and ownership from the seller to the purchaser. See La.R.S. 10:9-109(e). Thus, Advanta\\'s ownership interest in the RICs is not a secured interest in the traditional sense. See id. To conclude otherwise is to overlook that the Louisiana UCC draws a distinction between a chattel paper purchaser\\'s security interest and a traditional security interest in personal property securing payment or performance of an obligation. See La. R.S. 10:1-201(37).\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         The majority opinion notes, in a footnote, that \"the district court\\'s conclusion that the vendor\\'s right of dissolution does not conflict with any specific provision of Chapter 9 finds support in the writings of Louisiana\\'s leading property law scholar.\" On the contrary, the section of the property law treatise cited by the majority opinion addresses only an unpaid vendor\\'s right to demandjudicial dissolution of a contract under Article 2561. See A.N. Yiannopoulos, Property &#167; 233 n. 5 in La. Civ. Law Treatise (4th ed. 2001) (making clear that the \"vendor\\'s right of dissolution\" discussed in &#167; 233 is the right to seek judicial dissolution, governed by La. Civ.Code. arts. 2561-2564). The majority opinion cites to no authority or case addressing an unpaid vendor\\'s right to extrajudicially and unilaterally dissolve a contract under Articles 2013, 2016, and 2549 of the Civil Code, the articles which were cited by the district court as its basis for its summary-judgment dismissal of Advanta\\'s tort claim against Sugarland.\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         Sugarland also contends that, under &#167; 9-404(a) of the Louisiana UCC, Advanta\\'s rights in the RICs are subject to any defense or claim arising from the transactions giving rise to the RICs, including Sugarland\\'s defense that its assignments to Argo are dissolved because of Argo\\'s failure to pay the purchase prices for eachSee La. R.S. 10:9-404(a). Sugarland\\'s reliance on &#167; 9-404(a) is in error. That section provides that \"an assignee generally takes an assignment subject to the defenses and claims of an account debtor.\" La. R.S. 10:9-404 cmt. 2. In other words, &#167; 9-404(a) applies to claims and defenses an account debtor (the party obligated under an account or chattel paper) can assert against an assignee (the purchaser of accounts and chattel paper).

ORCP 60. He assigns error to the trial court\\'s dismissal of his claims for battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence and employment discrimination under ORS 659.030(1)(b). The directed verdicts were appropriate only if defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Lindstrand v. Transamerica Title Ins. Co., 127 Or.App. 693, 695, 874 P.2d 82 (1994). We reverse, in part.\\nIn determining whether the trial court erred, we view the evidence in the light most *527 favorable to plaintiff and extend to him the benefit of every reasonable inference that could be drawn from the evidence. Foster v. Schnell Refrigeration Co., 280 Or. 411, 414, 571 P.2d 497 (1977). In that light, we state the facts. Plaintiff worked for defendant Pameco as a branch manager. Defendant Wally George supervised plaintiff as part of George\\'s duties as regional manager for Pameco. Plaintiff and George interacted on a regular basis at plaintiff\\'s workplace and at off-site Pameco meetings. George had an intimidating supervisory style. He often expressed anger by raising his voice, throwing his hands in the air and threatening employees with termination. At the same time, he would express greetings or goodbyes to his employees by saying \"hugs and kisses\" and would often touch the male employees by rubbing their necks or putting his arm around them.\\nAt some point before the alleged conduct at issue in this case, plaintiff discussed with George his views on homosexuality. He testified that he made it clear to George that he believed \"that the act of homosexuality * * * is not something that\\'s conducive to good family values nor good morals within our society, and * * * that the act of * * * homosexuality deteriorates a society[.]\" In January 1993, plaintiff and George attended a Pameco meeting in Las Vegas. One night after an awards ceremony, George threw his arm around plaintiff as they walked through the casino. Plaintiff testified that this contact left him with mixed feelings. The next morning, plaintiff went to George\\'s room at George\\'s invitation. George answered the door in boxer shorts. Five to ten minutes into the conversation, George got into bed and pulled the sheets up over his stomach and asked plaintiff why plaintiff \"didn\\'t * * * just get in bed.\" Plaintiff testified that he left immediately, feeling confused. After arriving home, he spoke to family members about the incident.\\nIn the following months, George touched plaintiff while at work on several other occasions. On one occasion, plaintiff described:\\n\"I was standing with a few managers outside the office and Mr. George put his arm\\x97he came out of his office, put his arm around me, and we turned, and he said, I want to talk to you.\\n\"And he was up close to me and he was massaging my neck as we were walking toward the back door of the warehouse. And we got back to the back door of the warehouse, and I nudged him and I said, come on, Wally, and I kind of moved to a\\x97you know, we were side by side and then I kind of moved to the side to talk to him face to face.\\n\"And as we were walking through the warehouse, I was close enough to him that when I turned to him and he turned to me talking to me, our faces were very close.\"\\nPlaintiff testified that he found the incident offensive because defendant \"was holding me like I would hold my wife.\" Another contact occurred at plaintiff\\'s desk when George sat down next to plaintiff so that their knees were, or were almost touching. Plaintiff testified and demonstrated to the jury how \"[George] took his hand and he placed it on the inside of my left leg with his palm about on my\\x97you know where that round thing is on your knee? His palm was right there and his fingers were up my thigh.\" Plaintiff moved his knee quickly away because he found the touch offensive, and he testified that the incident angered him. In mid-August 1993, plaintiff and George met to discuss the sales numbers for plaintiff\\'s branch. George responded to plaintiff\\'s report by telling plaintiff: \"Well, if you do over $350,000, I\\'ll give you a big wet kiss and tongue.\"\\nPlaintiff testified that he became depressed as a result of George\\'s conduct.[1] He contacted some organizations that he thought could answer his questions about the incidents. Later, this exchange took place in February 1994 at another company meeting. Plaintiff testified:\\n\"[A]s I passed by Mr. George * * * Mr. George said, `How are you doing?\\' And I said, `Fine, how are you doing?\\' And he said, `Well, I have got a bad cold.[\\'] And I *528 said, `Well, I better not get too close.\\' And he said to me, `Does that mean I cannot invite you to my bed?\\'\"\\nIn May 1994, plaintiff filed this action related to the above conduct against George and Pameco after his employment had ended with Pameco. Plaintiff\\'s amended complaint contains six claims for relief, some of which involve claims against Pameco and George individually and others which involve allegations as to both defendants. In his first claim, plaintiff alleges that George committed a battery by touching him on the shoulder, neck and thigh. In his second and third claims, plaintiff alleges that George intentionally inflicted emotional distress on him by subjecting him to sexual advances, comments and conduct. In his first, second and third claims, plaintiff also alleges that Pameco committed battery and intentionally inflicted emotional distress on him. The trial court directed verdicts on all of those claims at the close of plaintiff\\'s case. In his fourth claim plaintiff alleges that he was wrongfully discharged under the common law because Pameco terminated him in retaliation for complaining about George\\'s sexual harassment. The jury returned a verdict for Pameco on that claim, and plaintiff does not assign the jury\\'s verdict as error on appeal. In his fifth claim, plaintiff alleges that Pameco was negligent in several particulars, including \"in creating, encouraging and maintaining an intimidating and hostile work environment[.]\" The trial court directed a verdict on all of the other allegations of negligence at the close of plaintiff\\'s case and on that specific allegation at the close of all the evidence in favor of Pameco. Lastly, plaintiff\\'s amended complaint alleges that Pameco discriminated against plaintiff in violation of ORS 659.030(1)(b) and 659.030(1)(f). The gravamen of those claims are that the company, knowing of George\\'s sexual harassment, failed to take remedial steps and\/or discharged plaintiff for complaining about George\\'s conduct. At the close of plaintiff\\'s case, the trial court granted Pameco\\'s motion for a directed verdict on plaintiff\\'s claim under ORS 659.030(1)(b). Likewise, at the close of all the evidence, the trial court granted Pameco\\'s motion for a directed verdict on plaintiff\\'s claim under ORS 659.030(1)(f). After trial, the court awarded costs to both defendants and attorney fees to Pameco.\\nOn appeal, plaintiff makes nine separate assignments of error. Two of those assignments refer to the trial court\\'s grant of directed verdicts on plaintiff\\'s claims for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) against George. Two other assignments refer to the trial court\\'s grant of directed verdicts on those same claims against Pameco. In addition, plaintiff assigns as error the dismissal of his negligence claim as well as the dismissal of his claim for discrimination under ORS 659.030. The remaining assignments of error relate to the trial court\\'s awards of costs and attorney fees. Because of our disposition on the other assignments, those awards are vacated, and we do not reach the parties\\' arguments about them.\\n\\nI. THE BATTERY AND IIED CLAIMS\\nThe trial court directed verdicts on the battery and IIED claims because\\n\"a reasonable jury made up of individuals would be unable to conclude that the acts as alleged and as testified to, without challenge at this point in the case, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, do not amount to outrageous conduct in the extreme, do not exceed or are not an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct, that no jury could find that.\"\\nA \"battery\" is a \"voluntary act that is intended to cause the resulting harmful or offensive contact.\" Walthers v. Gossett, 148 Or.App. 548, 552, 941 P.2d 575 (1997). \"It is not necessary that the contact do actual physical harm\\x97it is sufficient if the contact is offensive or insulting. Prosser, Law of Torts 36, \u00a7 9 (4th ed 1971).\" Bakker v. Baza\\'r, Inc., 275 Or. 245, 249, 551 P.2d 1269 (1976). George argues that \"no reasonable jury could have concluded that [he] caused harmful or offensive contact or intended to cause such contact\" by the manner in which he touched plaintiff. Specifically, he contends that plaintiff is hyper-sensitive to physical contact between males and that each instance of touching was nothing more than *529 ordinary social contact. Also, George asserts that he \"did not know, and could not have known, that plaintiff would be offended by these instances of non-threatening touching.\" We disagree that the jury would have been required to reach those findings on the basis of the evidence outlined above. It is also inferable from plaintiff\\'s testimony that George\\'s touching was sexual in nature in light of plaintiff\\'s previously expressed views about homosexuality and his reactions when touched. It is also inferable that George knew that his conduct would be considered objectively offensive when considered in the context of his course of conduct. The trial court erred in taking plaintiff\\'s claim for battery against George away from the jury.\\nTo prove the elements of an IIED claim, plaintiff must prove (1) an intent by George to inflict severe emotional distress on plaintiff, (2) that George\\'s acts caused plaintiff severe emotional distress and (3) that George\\'s acts constituted an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct. McGanty v. Staudenraus, 321 Or. 532, 543, 901 P.2d 841 (1995). George argues that \"no reasonable jury could have concluded that [his] alleged conduct was sufficiently outrageous to be actionable or that [he] intended to inflict severe emotional distress on plaintiff.\" In response, plaintiff argues that he introduced evidence of a continuing course of unwelcome touching of intimate parts of his body and sexual and hostile comments by George to him that spanned over a year. He asserts that the outrageousness of the conduct is further supported by the fact that defendant George began directing his harassing conduct at plaintiff only after he found out that plaintiff believed that type of behavior and conduct to be offensive and to be contrary to plaintiff\\'s religious and moral values. Those facts, according to plaintiff, would allow a jury to find that George intended to inflict emotional distress on him, or, alternatively, that George was substantially certain that emotional distress would result from his conduct.\\nThere is evidence from which a jury could properly infer that George intended to inflict severe emotional distress on plaintiff. A jury could find that George was aware of plaintiff\\'s views on homosexuality and undertook to cause him to become emotionally distressed by subjecting him to unconsented to and unwanted physical touching. That is a reasonable inference in light of George\\'s other comments to plaintiff and the fact that the conduct began after George became aware of plaintiff\\'s views on homosexual behavior. Also, the multiple instances of contact and innuendos could demonstrate that George\\'s conduct was not an isolated pattern of boorish behavior but a concerted effort to harass plaintiff. In that light, a jury could reasonably conclude that the first element of an IIED claim had been satisfied.\\nWhether conduct constitutes an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct is a question of law. As we explained in Whelan v. Albertson\\'s, Inc., 129 Or.App. 501, 505-06, 879 P.2d 888 (1994):\\n\"Our inquiry * * * begins with an analysis of those cases where statements have been held to be socially intolerable and those where statements were held to be merely rude. We have held that racial and ethnic slurs can be socially intolerable. Lathrope-Olson v. Dept. of Transportation, 128 Or.App. 405, 408, 876 P.2d 345 (1994). Language used to sexually harass, such as `all women were good for was between their legs,\\' has also been deemed socially intolerable. 128 Or.App. at 408, 876 P.2d 345. In contrast, unfounded, private accusations of lying and sabotage were characterized as rude and boorish, but not actionable. Watte v. Edgar Maeyens, Jr., M.D., P.C., 112 Or.App. 234, 828 P.2d 479, rev. den., 314 Or. 176, 836 P.2d 1345 (1992). Here, the insults directed at plaintiff were sexual in nature and resemble the socially intolerable sexual references in Lathrope-Olson v. Dept. of Transportation, supra.\\n\\n\"If the content of statements alone is not dispositive, we also consider the context and repetition of the insults, in determining whether the statements were socially intolerable.\\n\"`The invitation to a woman to illicit intercourse, insufficient in itself [to be actionable], *530 becomes extreme outrage when it is prolonged and repeated to the point of hounding, and accompanied by advertising in the form of indecent pictures or exposure.\\' Prosser, Torts \u00a7 11 at 48, 49 (3d ed 1964). Quoted in Pakos v. Clark, 253 Or. 113, 126, 453 P.2d 682 (1969).\"\\nIn addition, we may consider the existence of a special relationship, including an employer and employee relationship, between the parties in determining the bounds of socially tolerable conduct. MacCrone v. Edwards Center, Inc., 160 Or.App. 91, 100, 980 P.2d 1156 (1999). On this record, a jury could find that George\\'s physical contact with plaintiff in conjunction with his statements to plaintiff constituted a course of sexual harassment and, therefore, socially intolerable conduct. We conclude that plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to establish the elements of IIED and that the trial court erred in dismissing his IIED claim against George.\\nPlaintiff proceeds on two alternative theories regarding his battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims against Pameco. First, plaintiff appears to argue that there is sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Pameco directed George\\'s conduct. In Walthers, we explained that\\n\"a corporation can be directly liable for intentional torts where: (1) the tort is committed by a person or persons wielding `the whole executive power of the corporation\\'; and (2) the tortious acts were committed `in behalf of the corporation.\\'\" 148 Or.App. at 556, 941 P.2d 575 (citing to Bingham v. Lipman, 40 Or. 363, 365, 67 P. 98 (1901)).\\nAlthough plaintiff introduced some evidence of sexual innuendos in a company newsletter and managerial skit, there is no evidence that Pameco directed that George sexually harass plaintiff. Plaintiff\\'s first theory fails for lack of proof.\\nIn the alternative, plaintiff argues that evidence in the record would permit a jury to find that Pameco is vicariously liable for George\\'s conduct. In order to withstand a motion for a directed verdict on the issue of vicarious liability, plaintiff must have presented sufficient evidence that George\\'s acts fell within the course and scope of his employment. Chesterman v. Barmon, 305 Or. 439, 442-43, 753 P.2d 404 (1988). The proper inquiries are:\\n\"(1) whether the act occurred substantially within the time and space limits authorized by the employment; (2) whether the employee was motivated, at least partially, by a purpose to serve the employer; and (3) whether the act is of a kind which the employee was hired to perform.\" Id. at 442, 753 P.2d 404.\\nUnder the Supreme Court\\'s holding in Fearing v. Bucher, 328 Or. 367, 977 P.2d 1163 (1999), and Lourim v. Swensen, 328 Or. 380, 977 P.2d 1157 (1999), the focus is not on whether George acted in Pameco\\'s interest or whether George was hired to sexually harass plaintiff. Rather, the focus is whether the acts complained of resulted from or were the outgrowth of the exercise of George\\'s employment duties. A jury could find that George\\'s conduct occurred while he was supervising plaintiff; thus, plaintiff\\'s evidence suffices to meet these requirements. We conclude that the trial court erred in directing verdicts in favor of Pameco on plaintiff\\'s battery and IIED claims on the theory of vicarious liability.\\n\\nII. THE NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS\\nPlaintiff\\'s complaint alleges that:\\n\"Defendant Pameco was negligent in one or more of the following particulars:\\n\"(a) In creating, encouraging and maintaining an intimidating and hostile work environment;\\n\"(b) In encouraging and allowing acts of sexual harassment upon employees;\\n\"(c) In failing to adequately train defendant George in matters relating to sexual harassment;\\n\"(d) In failing to adequately supervise, reprimand and discipline defendant George;\\n\"(e) In failing to disseminate a written sexual harassment policy and educate Pameco employees regarding matters pertaining to sexual harassment;\\n\\n*531 \"(f) In failing to enforce a sexual harassment policy; and\\n\"(g) In failing to properly investigate the various sexual harassment complaints about defendant George.\"\\nPameco argued to the trial court that plaintiff\\'s negligence claim was precluded under the Workers\\' Compensation Act\\'s exclusivity provision. ORS 656.018(1)(a).[2] Plaintiff relies on the exception to the exclusivity provision found in ORS 656.018(3)(a) (1993) that provides:\\n\"The exemption from liability given an employer under this section is also extended to the employer\\'s insurer, the self-insured employer\\'s claims administrator, the department, and the contracted agents, employees, officers and directors of the employer, the employer\\'s insurer, the self-insured employer\\'s claims administrator and the department, except that the exemption from liability shall not apply:\\n\"(a) Where the injury is proximately caused by willful and unprovoked aggression by the person otherwise exempt under this subsection[.]\"\\nAs the trial court indicated, plaintiff cannot use the statutory exception in ORS 656.018(3) for \"willful\" acts to support a \"negligence\" claim against Pameco. See Virgil v. Walker, 280 Or. 607, 611-12, 572 P.2d 314 (1977) (holding that the term willful in the statute means \"deliberately and intentionally\"). On appeal, plaintiff reasserts a similar argument, relying on our holding in Palmer v. Bi-Mart Company, 92 Or.App. 470, 758 P.2d 888 (1988). However, that case is inapposite because it too involved deliberate and intentional conduct. The trial court did not err in directing a verdict on the negligence claims.\\n\\nIII. THE STATUTORY CLAIMS\\nFinally, plaintiff assigns error to the trial court\\'s grant of Pameco\\'s motion for a directed verdict on plaintiff\\'s claim under ORS 659.030 (1993). That statute provided, in relevant part:\\n\"(1) For the purposes of ORS 659.010 to 659.110, 659.227, 659.330, 659.340, 659.400 to 659.460 and 659.505 to 659.545, it is an unlawful employment practice:\\n\"* * * * *\\n\"(b) For an employer, because of an individual\\'s race, religion, color, sex, national origin, marital status or age if the individual is 18 years of age or older, or because of the race, religion, color, sex, national origin, marital status or age of any other person with whom the individual associates, or because of a juvenile record, that has been expunged pursuant to ORS 419A.260 and 419A.262, of any individual, to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment.\\n\"* * * * *\\n\"(f) For any employer, labor organization or employment agency to discharge, expel or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden by this section, ORS 30.670, 30.685, 659.033 and 659.400 to 659.460, or because the person has filed a complaint, testified or assisted in any proceeding under ORS 659.010 to 659.110, 659.400 to 659.460 and 659.505 to 659.545 or has attempted to do so.\"[3]\\nThe statutory claims were tried to the trial court. At the close of plaintiff\\'s case, the trial court granted Pameco\\'s motion for a directed verdict on plaintiff\\'s claim under *532 ORS 659.030(1)(b). At the close of all the evidence, the trial court granted Pameco\\'s motion for a directed verdict on plaintiff\\'s claim under ORS 659.030(1)(f). Apparently, the trial court ruled that George\\'s conduct was not related to plaintiff\\'s gender as a matter of law. The trial court explained:\\n\"I don\\'t see any tie-in to any activity that I\\'ve heard [of] because of Mr. Harris\\' sex[.]\\n\"* * * * *\\n\"* * * I don\\'t believe that\\x97first of all, I don\\'t believe that there was discrimination in this sense, but I further don\\'t believe that there is discrimination because of Mr. Harris being a man or anything else. I mean, there just wasn\\'t. There\\'s no discrimination against Mr. Harris in terms of compensation that I can see. That claim comes up when you and I have the same experience, [defense counsel]. We apply for the job and I get promoted and you don\\'t.\"\\nWe are not persuaded by the trial court\\'s analysis.[4] The grant of a directed verdict under ORCP 60 means that, as a matter of law, no reasonable fact finder could draw the inferences alleged by the plaintiff. As we have previously indicated, the record is susceptible to a reasonable inference that George undertook to sexually harass plaintiff.\\nOn the issue of Pameco\\'s liability for George\\'s conduct under the statute, both parties recognize that because ORS 659.030 was modeled after Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000E et seq., federal cases interpreting Title VII are instructive. See Mains v. II Morrow, Inc., 128 Or.App. 625, 634, 877 P.2d 88 (1994). In Mains, the court considered when, under ORS 659.030, an employer could be liable for a supervisor\\'s actions towards an employee:\\n\"The federal courts acknowledge that sexual harassment may take different forms. Those courts generally follow two methodologies in analyzing such cases. In `quid pro quo\\' cases, the employer is liable if it links employment benefits to the acceptance or rejection of sexual favors. The employer is strictly liable if the supervisor uses the employee\\'s acceptance or rejection of sexual favors as a quid pro quo for job benefits. * * *.\\n\"The second methodology permits recovery for a sexually `hostile environment.\\' Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986), says:\\n\"`For sexual harassment to be actionable, it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive \"to alter the conditions of [the victim\\'s] employment and create an abusive working environment.\"\\'\\n\"* * * In applying this methodology, the Court has not adopted a precise standard for determining an employer\\'s liability for a supervisor\\'s conduct, but has applied only general agency principles. However, the lower federal courts have developed a somewhat clearer rule. In Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., [867 F.2d 1311, 1316, (11th Cir.) reh\\'g denied 874 F.2d 821 (1989)] the court held that when the plaintiff claims that a co-worker created a hostile environment through sexual harassment, the employer is liable if the employer `knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action against the supervisor.\\' * * * The Oregon Supreme Court quoted this federal standard, without comment, in Holien v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 298 Or. 76, 89, 689 P.2d 1292 (1984). We follow that standard here.\" 128 Or.App. at 634-35, 877 P.2d 88 (footnotes and some internal citations omitted); see also Fred Meyer, Inc. v. BOLI, 152 Or.App. 302, 309, 954 P.2d 804 (1998) (applying a \"totality of the circumstances\" test to determine what constitutes an \"intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment\").\\nIn this case, plaintiff argues that he presented sufficient evidence to support his claims under ORS 659.030(1)(b) that (1) George\\'s sexual harassment of him was severe and pervasive enough to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive environment; and, (2) that Pameco knew or should have known of the specific conduct *533 of which plaintiff complains. In response, Pameco argues that\\n\"[it] is not liable for the actions of one of its supervisors because the Company took reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment and plaintiff unreasonably failed to utilize remedial measures available to him. Even if Pameco could be liable for these actions, when viewed in the social context in which the alleged harassment took place, the actions could not be considered offensive to a reasonable person.\"\\nWe hold that, should a fact finder believe plaintiff\\'s version of the events, it could also find that George\\'s conduct created an intimidating, hostile and offensive working environment. The more difficult issue is whether there is evidence that Pameco knew of or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action against George. There is evidence that other branch managers and plaintiff\\'s branch employees witnessed at least some of the conduct or comments. However, there is no evidence that anyone witnessed George\\'s invitation to plaintiff in Las Vegas or the alleged placement of his hand on plaintiff\\'s thigh. Until March 31, 1994, plaintiff did not complain about George\\'s conduct to any of George\\'s superiors at Pameco, although plaintiff could have contacted those individuals. On one occasion in December of 1993, plaintiff discussed with George\\'s superior his opposition to a decision that George had made that affected plaintiff\\'s branch without mentioning George\\'s harassing conduct. Within days after receiving plaintiff\\'s complaint about George\\'s harassment of him, Pameco sent two of its human resources personnel to investigate plaintiff\\'s complaint along with two complaints that plaintiff had forwarded from two other branch employees about George\\'s conduct towards them. When Pameco\\'s investigators arrived, plaintiff refused to talk to them without his attorney present. The Pameco representatives became angry with plaintiff\\'s refusal to speak with them and terminated him on April 5, less than a week after receiving his complaint. The only evidence is that Pameco promptly investigated, once it became aware of plaintiff\\'s complaint. It follows that, on this record, Pameco took the remedial action available to it during the time that plaintiff was employed. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiff\\'s claim under ORS 659.030(1)(b). However, that conclusion does not foreclose the possibility that plaintiff made a sufficient record to survive a motion for a directed verdict on his claim for retaliatory discharge under ORS 659.030(1)(f).[5]\\nORS 659.030(1)(f) (1993) makes it an unlawful employment practice for \"any employer * * * to discharge * * * any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden by this section[.]\" In order to withstand a motion for directed verdict, plaintiff must have introduced evidence that demonstrates that he was discharged by Pameco for opposing George\\'s sexual harassment. Under the statute, it is not necessary that he prove liability under subsection (b); evidence that he opposed \"practices\" forbidden by the statute is sufficient.\\nPameco does not argue on appeal that the trial court should have granted a directed verdict on the ground that the only evidence is that Pameco fired plaintiff because of his lack of cooperation with its investigation. Rather, Pameco argues that subsection (b) does not prohibit same gender harassment for sexual purposes. It follows, according to Pameco, that plaintiff\\'s claim is not cognizable because he has failed to show discrimination because of his sex. Oregon appellate courts have not ruled on this issue so far as we can determine. However, the United States Supreme Court has considered that question under Title VII, and, as we stated before, Title VII law is instructive in interpreting ORS 659.030.\\nIn Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998), the male plaintiff had filed a complaint alleging that he was discriminated against in his employment by other male employees, including supervisors, because of his sex. The trial court granted the *534 defendant company\\'s summary judgment motion, holding that the plaintiff had no cause of action under Title VII for same gender sexual harassment. Oncale, 523 U.S. at 77, 118 S. Ct. 998. Because the Court\\'s opinion to the contrary directly addresses the issue present in this case, we set it forth at length:\\n\"If our precedents leave any doubt on the question, we hold today that nothing in Title VII necessarily bars a claim of discrimination `because of ... sex\\' merely because the plaintiff and the defendant (or the person charged with acting on behalf of the defendant) are of the same sex.\\n\"Courts have had little trouble with that principle in cases like Johnson [v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U.S. 616, 107 S. Ct. 1442, 94 L. Ed. 2d 615 (1987) ], where an employee claims to have been passed over for a job or promotion. But when the issue arises in the context of a `hostile environment\\' sexual harassment claim, the state and federal courts have taken a bewildering variety of stances. Some, like the Fifth Circuit in this case, have held that same-sex sexual harassment claims are never cognizable under Title VII. See also, e.g., Goluszek v. H.P. Smith, 697 F. Supp. 1452 (N.D.Ill.1988). Other decisions say that such claims are actionable only if the plaintiff can prove that the harasser is homosexual (and thus presumably motivated by sexual desire). Compare McWilliams v. Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, 72 F.3d 1191 (C.A.4 1996)[, cert. den. 519 U.S. 819, 117 S. Ct. 72, 136 L.Ed.2d 32(1996)], with Wrightson v. Pizza Hut of America, 99 F.3d 138 (C.A.4 1996). Still others suggest that workplace harassment that is sexual in content is always actionable, regardless of the harasser\\'s sex, sexual orientation, or motivations. See Doe v. Belleville, 119 F.3d 563 (C.A.7 1997)[, cert. granted and judgment vacated for further reconsideration in light of Oncale 523 U.S. 75, 118 S.Ct 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998) ].\\n\"We see no justification in the statutory language or our precedents for a categorical rule excluding same-sex harassment claims from the coverage of Title VII. As some courts have observed, male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII. But statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed. Title VII prohibits `discriminat[ion] ... because of ... sex\\' in the `terms\\' or `conditions\\' of employment. Our holding that this includes sexual harassment must extend to sexual harassment of any kind that meets the statutory requirements.\\n\"* * * We have never held that workplace harassment, even harassment between men and women, is automatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content or connotations. `The critical issue, Title VII\\'s text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\\' Harris [v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 25, 114 S. Ct. 367, 372, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993) ] (GINSBURG, J., concurring).\\n\"Courts and juries have found the inference of discrimination easy to draw in most male-female sexual harassment situations, because the challenged conduct typically involves explicit or implicit proposals of sexual activity; it is reasonable to assume those proposals would not have been made to someone of the same sex. The same chain of inference would be available to a plaintiff alleging same-sex harassment, if there were credible evidence that the harasser was homosexual. But harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire to support an inference of discrimination on the basis of sex. A trier of fact might reasonably find such discrimination, for example, if a female victim is harassed in such sex-specific and derogatory terms by another woman as to make it clear that the harasser is motivated by general hostility to the presence of women in the workplace. A same-sex harassment plaintiff may also, of course, offer direct comparative evidence about *535 how the alleged harasser treated members of both sexes in a mixed-sex workplace. Whatever evidentiary route the plaintiff chooses to follow, he or she must always prove that the conduct at issue was not merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations, but actually constituted `discrimina[tion]... because of ... sex.\\'\" Id. at 79-81.\\nThe Oncale Court\\'s plain-language analysis of Title VII (the same language found in ORS 659.030(1)(b)) informs our analysis of the issue in this case. There is nothing in the language of ORS 659.030(1)(b) that bars a claim of discrimination because the sexual harassment is aimed at a person of the same gender. Consistent with the language of the statute, plaintiff continues to have the burden of persuading the fact finder that he suffered discrimination because of his sex. However, that is a question of fact, not of law.\\nAdditionally, Pameco argues that \"[i]f this court determines that U.S. Supreme Court authority should be followed in the same-sex harassment regard, it should likewise apply the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s test for vicarious liability adopted by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries.\" As discussed above, the Oregon Supreme Court has established the test for vicarious liability in Chesterman. Pameco has not asserted that the language of ORS 659.030 or any other related statute requires, or permits, the application of a different test, nor has Pameco directed us to any such language. Consequently, we decline to apply any other standard in this context. In conclusion, we hold that the trial court erred in directing a verdict on plaintiff\\'s ORS 659.030(1)(f) claim on the grounds argued by Pameco.\\nJudgment for defendants on plaintiff\\'s claims for battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and discrimination under ORS 659.030(1)(f) reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  On appeal, defendants do not controvert plaintiff\\'s contention that he suffered severe emotional distress. There is sufficient evidence in the record for a jury to find that plaintiff suffered from depression following these incidents.\\n[2]  ORS 656.018(1)(a) provides:\\n\\n\"The liability of every employer who satisfies the duty required by ORS 656.017(1) is exclusive and in place of all other liability arising out of injuries, diseases, symptom complexes or similar conditions arising out of and in the course of employment that are sustained by subject workers, the workers\\' beneficiaries and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from the employer on account of such conditions or claims resulting therefrom, specifically including claims for contribution or indemnity asserted by third persons from whom damages are sought on account of such conditions, except as specifically provided otherwise in this chapter.\"\\nAlthough ORS chapter 656 has been amended after the events at issue in this case, none of the changes affects our analysis or conclusions.\\n[3]  ORS 659.121(1) (1993) provides that \"[a]ny person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful employment practice prohibited by * * * [ORS] 659.030 * * * may file a civil suit in circuit court[.]\"\\n[4]  Had the court ruled as a matter of fact that there was no sexual harassment of plaintiff after weighing the competing evidence on that issue, our standard of review would be different.\\n[5]  We do not decide what preclusive effect, if any, the jury\\'s verdict on the common-law discharge claim has on plaintiff\\'s statutory claim because the parties have not raised that issue.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 2638728}]"},{"id":1318757,"date_filed":"1986-07-29","judges":"Peterson, C.J., and Lent, Linde, Campbell, Carson and Jones","case_name_full":"COOPER, Respondent on Review, v.

In a letter to the staff of the school where she taught, she wrote that she would wear the turban and often wear white clothing as part of her religious practice, and that she had explained this and other changes in her life to her students.[1] She continued to wear her white garb after being warned that she faced suspension if she violated a law against wearing religious dress at her work. The law provides, in ORS 342.650:\\n\"No teacher in any public school shall wear any religious dress while engaged in the performance of duties as a teacher.\"\\nand, in ORS 342.655:\\n\"Any teacher violating the provisions of ORS 342.650 shall be suspended from employment by the district school board. The board shall report its action to the Superintendent of Public Instruction who shall revoke the teacher\\'s teaching certificate.\"\\nPursuant to these statutes, the school superintendent, acting for the school board, suspended Cooper from teaching and reported this action to the Superintendent of Public Instruction, who, after a hearing, revoked Cooper\\'s teaching certificate. This order was challenged on constitutional grounds in the Court of Appeals, which set *301 aside the revocation of the teaching certificate as an excessive sanction under the court\\'s understanding of federal First Amendment doctrine. Cooper v. Eugene Sch. Dist. No. 4J, 76 Or.App. 146, 708 P.2d 1161 (1985). On petitions by the school district and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, we allowed review.\\n\\nI. THE AGENCY ORDER\\nAt the outset, we must work our way through a number of problems that the parties and the Court of Appeals passed over in silence. The school district and the Superintendent of Public Instruction (hereafter \"Superintendent\" in distinction from the district\\'s superintendent) seek a decision on the constitutionality of ORS 342.650 and 342.655, and this may also be the chief remaining objective of the teacher, who has moved to New Mexico and whose Oregon teaching certificate has been reinstated conditional upon compliance with the law. Nonetheless, this case like others is, and if possible should remain, a case of ordinary administrative and statutory law before becoming a constitutional case.[2] The case came before the Court of Appeals on judicial review of an order in a contested administrative proceeding to revoke a license, and it cannot be converted into a declaratory proceeding on the constitutionality of a statute to accommodate the parties.\\nThe problems passed over in silence are, first, why the school district is a party to this proceeding; second, what was before the Superintendent for decision in a contested case; and third, whether the case is moot. A reading of the statutes makes evident how these problems are interrelated.\\nStanding in the revocation procedure. ORS 342.650 forbids a teacher to \"wear any religious dress while engaged in the performance of his duties as a teacher.\" ORS 342.655 directs the district school board to suspend the employment of any teacher who violates this proscription and to report its action to the Superintendent, \"who shall revoke the teacher\\'s teaching certificate.\" Obviously disputes may arise over exactly how a teacher was dressed, whether what she wore was \"religious dress,\" what the teacher\\'s \"duties as a teacher\" were, and whether she wore the \"religious dress\" while \"engaged in the performance\" of those duties. The agency that makes those determinations is the district school board. ORS 342.655 does not direct the Superintendent to reexamine the school board\\'s findings and \"action\" and its underlying findings and conclusions before revoking the teacher\\'s certificate. We do not foreclose an argument that could be made to the contrary, possibly under the Administrative Procedure Act, ORS 183.310(2)(a)(C), but none was made here.\\nThe present version of ORS 342.650 and 342.655 was enacted in 1965 in a major revision of public education laws that included extensive provisions governing the certification, employment, and discharge of teachers. Or.Laws 1965, ch 100. These provisions were further amended during the same session by the Teacher Tenure Law, Or.Laws 1965, ch. 608. The Teacher Tenure Law entitled a permanent teacher to have a district superintendent\\'s recommendation of dismissal reviewed by a panel of a Professional Review Committee and to a hearing by the school board before the board acted on the recommendation. In 1971, the law again was amended to provide review of a teacher\\'s dismissal by a panel of the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board. Or.Laws 1971, ch. 570. These statutes are now found in ORS 342.805 to 342.930.[3]*302 None of the parties nor the Court of Appeals addressed the question what substantive or procedural effects various provisions of the Teacher Tenure Law might have on a teacher\\'s suspension and a resulting revocation of the teacher\\'s certificate under ORS 342.650 and 342.655.\\nThe teacher obviously has standing to challenge the state Superintendent\\'s revocation of her teaching certificate, and a demand for a hearing before that official is a logical first step, despite doubts whether the law leaves anything for him to decide. But the school district\\'s stake in the revocation of the teacher\\'s certificate is far from obvious. The district need not request revocation and is not otherwise a necessary party to the revocation proceeding. Again, possible arguments for allowing the district to intervene in the revocation proceeding can be imagined, but none were made here.[4] The record contains no motion to intervene or order allowing intervention. The district simply appeared before the Superintendent\\'s hearing officer without stating any reasons for its appearance and was allowed to participate without objection.\\nThe Superintendent\\'s responsibility. What the parties wanted the Superintendent to decide was the constitutional validity of the law forbidding a teacher to wear religious dress while on duty. The Superintendent, adopting the hearing officer\\'s memorandum of law, concluded that he had no power to decide the constitutional question. The memorandum stated:\\n\"Judicial decisions are not completely in accord, but the clear consensus seems to be that in a proceeding such as this the administrative agency has no authority to declare an act of the legislature to be contrary to the federal and state constitutions. That decision is to be made by a court. The Attorney General takes a contrary position.\"\\nThe memorandum quoted Professor K.C. Davis\\'s distinction between applying a statute constitutionally, which is the agency\\'s duty, and determining the constitutional validity of a statute, which Davis considers to be beyond an agency\\'s power.[5]\\nEnough judicial opinions have said that agencies cannot pass on the constitutionality of the laws entrusted to them to support the cautious conclusion of the hearing officer\\'s memorandum, at least as to federal agencies; but more recently the proposition has been questioned.[6] It deserves examination.\\nAgency power to consider constitutional challenges to a statute generally has been discussed in opinions on exhaustion of administrative remedies. The issue has been, not whether an agency erred in considering such a challenge, but whether a litigant could take the challenge to court without first asking the agency to pass upon it. Both the Davis treatise and Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 438 (1965), place the question under the \"exhaustion\" heading.\\nThis is not such a case. Opinions denying agency power in constitutional cases *303 only as an explanation for dispensing with the normal exhaustion requirement are weak authority for holding that an agency should not consider a constitutional claim when a party chooses to exhaust that process, or that the agency errs if it doesdecide the issue. If an agency decides a constitutional issue, though needlessly, the only result is that it will be affirmed on judicial review if the decision was right and reversed if the decision was wrong. It would be pointless to reverse an agency for correctly deciding a legal question on the ground that the agency should have waited for the reviewing court to decide the question.\\nLong familiarity with the institution of judicial review sometimes leads to the misconception that constitutional law is exclusively a matter for the courts. To the contrary, when a court sets aside government action on constitutional grounds, it necessarily holds that legislators or officials attentive to a proper understanding of the constitution would or should have acted differently.[7] Doubt of an agency\\'s obligation to decide constitutional challenges to its governing statute is itself a question of interpreting the agency\\'s statutory duties. The agency\\'s duty to decide such challenges would not be doubted if the legislature provided for it expressly rather than doing so implicitly under the general term \"law\" in the Administrative Procedure Act provisions that require a final order in a contested case to include the agency\\'s conclusions of law, ORS 183.470(2), and subject the order to reversal if it violates a constitutional provision, ORS 183.482(8)(b)(C), see also ORS 183.484(4)(b)(C).\\nAn agency ordinarily can interpret a statute so as to exclude unconstitutional applications before it is forced to question the statute\\'s validity. An agency also should consider whether anyone can obtain higher executive or judicial review if the agency erroneously concludes that the statute contravenes the constitution. In the present case, as we next discuss, there is no obvious party that could obtain review if the Superintendent held ORS 342.650 or 342.655 unconstitutional.\\nThe parties\\' standing in the Court of Appeals. As already noted, the school district\\'s legal interest in the Superintendent\\'s revocation of Cooper\\'s teaching certificate under ORS 342.655 is doubtful. The district maintains, and in the absence of any objection the Court of Appeals could accept, that the district\\'s unopposed appearance before the hearing officer effectively made it an intervening party. Cf. *304 Marbet v. Portland Gen. Elect., 277 Or. 447, 561, P.2d 154 (1977). But the district\\'s role became even more dubious after the Superintendent ordered revocation of the certificate, when the district filed a petition to review that order in the Court of Appeals, naming Cooper as the respondent and seeking to have the order affirmed. At this point, the Court of Appeals should have dismissed the district\\'s petition for judicial review.\\nThe court quoted ORS 183.480(1), which allows \"any party to an agency proceeding\" to seek judicial review of a final order in a contested case, and it wrote that the statute \"does not require that the petitioning party attack the validity of the order.\" 76 Or.App. at 148 n. 2, 708 P.2d 1161. That is an improbable reading of the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. It assumes that the legislature entitled a party that won everything it asked from the agency to seek judicial review solely in order to win once more in the Court of Appeals. The court\\'s theory would entitle an agency, as a party to its own proceedings, to seek a judicial imprimatur for its acts when no one has challenged their legality and when the agency neither needs nor seeks a court\\'s aid to enforce them. Such an innovation in judicial review would require a clear legislative directive, if indeed it would remain within the judicial power at all. We find no such clear directive.\\nTwo of the judicial review sections point toward the contrary, conventional assumption. ORS 183.480(1) has provided judicial review separately for any \"person adversely affected or aggrieved\" and for \"any party to an agency proceeding\" (emphasis added) since the section was amended in 1971 to extend judicial review to adversely affected or aggrieved persons who were not \"parties\" to any proceeding. See Marbet v. Portland Gen. Elect., supra, 277 Or. at 457, 561 P.2d 154; cf. Jefferson Landfill Comm. v. Marion Co., 297 Or. 280, 686 P.2d 310 (1984). The subsection continues by expressly dispensing with the prerequisite of a petition for reconsideration by the agency. This provision reflects the normal assumption that a petitioner for judicial review finds some fault with the agency\\'s order.\\nORS 183.482, prescribing judicial review of orders in contested cases, does not expressly require the petition for review to state the grounds why the order should be reversed or remanded, but ORS 183.484(3) makes this clear with respect to agency orders outside contested cases.[8] That a party wishes an agency to explain its order by different or further reasons, as the school district requested in this case, is not a demand for modification of the order.\\nThe school district requested the Court of Appeals to affirm the Superintendent\\'s order revoking Cooper\\'s teaching certificate. The district\\'s only stated disappointment with the Superintendent\\'s order is that his reasons for it did not expressly declare ORS 342.650 and 342.655 to be constitutional, an issue that he held to be beyond his authority. He did, however, apply the law and revoke the certificate, and the school district\\'s petition for judicial review asked the court to affirm that order without modification. For the reasons we have stated, the Court of Appeals should have dismissed that petition.\\nFifteen days after the school district\\'s petition, Cooper also petitioned for judicial review of the Superintendent\\'s revocation of her teaching certificate. If Cooper\\'s petition properly brought the order *305 before the Court of Appeals, could the school district appear before the Court of Appeals to defend the order? Again, the record contains no motion or order to allow intervention, and no discussion whether, under ORS 183.482(2), a person may become a party for the first time on judicial review to defend rather than attack an administrative order. In the absence of an objection, however, we see no jurisdictional obstacle that the Court of Appeals had to raise on its own initiative. The district could remain in the case as a respondent to Cooper\\'s attack on the Superintendent\\'s order.\\nFinally, we must consider whether the case became moot on its way to this court. Cooper\\'s petition for judicial review asserted that ORS 342.650, and therefore the revocation of her teaching certificate under ORS 342.655, contravene the guarantees of religious freedom under the state and federal constitutions as well as the provisions of Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC \u00a7 2000e to 2000e-16 (1981 &amp; Supp 1986). The Court of Appeals noted that subsequently the Superintendent reinstated Cooper\\'s teaching certificate on condition that she not wear religious dress while on duty, and it held that the condition saved Cooper\\'s appeal from being moot.[9] Eventually the court held that revocation of a teaching certificate was an excessive sanction under the First Amendment and reversed the order under review. The Superintendent for the first time became a losing party and as such entitled to seek review in this court of the invalidation of his order and ORS 342.655. So did the school district, once it was accepted as an intervenor in support of the Superintendent\\'s order.\\nThe foregoing procedural problems should have been dealt with below, which might have obviated any need for further review. Despite the dubious status of the parties and proceedings below, however, the holding of the Court of Appeals left the case in a posture in which the Superintendent now is entitled a decision from this court.\\n\\nII. OREGON\\'S GUARANTEES OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\\nCooper\\'s case is not one of declining to comply with an otherwise valid law on grounds of personal religious belief. The law here at issue is not a general regulation, neutral toward religion on its face and in its policy, like the unemployment benefits standards that we sustained against attack under the Oregon Constitution (though not under the First Amendment) by claimants who had been discharged for religiously motivated conduct in Smith v. Employment Division, 301 Or. 209, 721 P.2d 445 (1986) and Black v. Employment Division, 301 Or. 221, 721 P.2d 451 (1986). The cases would be comparable if a school regulation prescribed how teachers should dress while on duty without taking account of religious considerations. Then we would have only an issue of statutory authority to make such a regulation, see Hysong v. Gallitzin School Dist., 164 Pa. 629, 30 A. 482 (1894); Neuhaus v. Federico, 12 Or.App. 314, 505 P.2d 939 (1973), and an individual claim to exemption on religious grounds. See, e.g., Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 *306 U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 1310, 89 L.Ed.2d 478 (1986) (military regulation prohibiting headgear indoors applied to Jewish servicemen\\'s yarmulkes); Menora v. Illinois High School Ass\\'n, 683 F.2d 1030 (7th Cir.1982) (rule forbidding headwear while playing basketball applied to yarmulkes). But ORS 342.650 is not neutral toward religion. On the contrary, the religious significance of the teacher\\'s dress is the specific target of this law. The law singles out a teacher\\'s religious dress because it is religious and to the extent that its religious significance is apparent when the wearer is engaged in teaching. The issue therefore is whether the law infringes the right guaranteed to \"all men\"[10] by Article I, section 2, of the Oregon Constitution \"to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences,\" or \"control[s] the free exercise, and enjoyment of religeous opinions, or interfere[s] with the rights of conscience\" contrary to Article I, section 3.\\nThis court sometimes has treated these guarantees and the First Amendment\\'s ban on laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion[11] as \"identical in meaning,\" City of Portland v. Thornton, 174 Or. 508, 512, 149 P.2d 972 (1942); but identity of \"meaning\" or even of text does not imply that the state\\'s laws will not be tested against the state\\'s own constitutional guarantees before reaching the federal constraints imposed by the Fourtenth Amendment, or that verbal formulas developed by the United States Supreme Court in applying the federal text also govern application of the state\\'s comparable clauses. See, e.g., State v. Brown, 301 Or. 268, 721 P.2d 1357 (1986) (searches and seizures), State v. Kennedy, 295 Or. 260, 666 P.2d 1316 (1983) (double jeopardy); Hewitt v. SAIF, 294 Or. 33, 653 P.2d 970 (1982) (sex discrimination)[12]. What is at issue in a constitutional dispute rarely is what a constitutional text \"means\" but how to effectuate that meaning in the disputed setting. Judicial formulas or \"factors\" are not themselves the law but aids to analysis that a court from time to time may employ, rephrase, or replace *307 with a better interpretation of their constitutional source.\\nThe guarantees of religious freedom in Article I provide:\\n\"Section 2. All men shall be secure in the Natural right, to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences.\\n\"Section 3. No law shall in any case whatever control the free exercise, and enjoyment of religeous (sic) opinions or interfere with the rights of conscience.\\n\"Section 4. No religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office of trust or profit.\\n\"Section 5. No money shall be drawn from the Treasury for the benefit of any religeous (sic), or theological institution, nor shall any money be appropriated for the payment of any religeous (sic) services in either house of the Legislative Assembly.\\n\"Section 6. No person shall be rendered incompetent as a witness, or juror in consequence of his opinions on matters of religeon (sic); nor be questioned in any Court of Justice touching his religeous (sic) belief to affect the weight of his testimony.\\n\"Section 7. The mode of administering an oath, or affirmation shall be such as may be most consistent with, and binding upon the conscience of the person to whom such oath or affirmation may be administered.\"\\nThis court in fact has interpreted the meaning of these guarantees independently, sometimes with results contrary to those reached by the United States Supreme Court. See, e.g., Smith v. Employment Division, supra; Salem College &amp; Academy, Inc. v. Employment Division, 298 Or. 471, 695 P.2d 25 (1985); Dickman v. School Dist. 62C, 232 Or. 238, 366 P.2d 533 (1961), cert. den. 371 U.S. 823, 83 S.Ct. 41, 9 L.Ed.2d 62 (1962).\\nThe religion clauses of Oregon\\'s Bill of Rights, Article I, sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, are more than a code. They are specifications of a larger vision of freedom for a diversity of religious beliefs and modes of worship and freedom from state-supported official faiths or modes of worship. The cumulation of guarantees, more numerous and more concrete than the opening clause of the First Amendment, reinforces the significance of the separate guarantees. Article I, section 4, for instance, forbids religious tests specifically \"as a qualification for any office of trust or profit\"; but in the total context of sections 2, 3, 6 and 7 it would be difficult to argue that the government could impose a religious test on employment in a position that technically is not an \"office of trust or profit,\" for instance in the public schools, on the grounds that such employment is a mere privilege.\\nLikewise, the present law cannot be sustained simply on grounds that it does not interfere with the free exercise of religion because it regulates conduct rather than religious beliefs or verbal expression of opinion and worship. On that theory, the law could equally ban wearing religious dress while teaching in private schools, or for that matter in public generally, without infringing the free exercise of religion. Such a theory would deny the importance of dress and other external symbols of individual and communal commitment to one\\'s faith that certainly were widely understood to represent (in the literal sense of that word) the practice of one\\'s religion when the constitutional guarantees were adopted. In some branches of Judaism and Christianity particular modes of dress, although voluntary, may be essential to an adherent\\'s sense of religious identity; in Islamic and other more encompassing religious communities, departure from prescribed dress may mean self-excommunication or lead to actual communal punishment.\\nThus, a law restricting dress specifically for being \"religious dress\" cannot stand as a regulation of \"conduct\" rather than \"belief\" or \"worship.\" If such a law is to be valid, it must be justified by a determination that religious dress necessarily contravenes the wearer\\'s role or function at the time and place beyond any realistic means of accommodation.\\n*308 The compatibility of religious dress with the role of public school teachers is an old issue under state laws and constitutions. Generally it involved teaching by nuns while wearing the habits of their orders. It is, of course, a different question whether a constitution itself is claimed to forbid the display of the teacher\\'s religious commitment in the public school or whether a ban on religious dress adopted by law or properly delegated rule contravenes the teacher\\'s religious freedom. In two often cited cases, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania first held that wearing religious dress did not constitute sectarian teaching, Hysong v. Gallitzin School Dist., supra; but after the legislature enacted a law much like ORS 342.650, the court sustained the act. Commonwealth v. Herr, 229 Pa. 132, 78 A. 68 (1910). Similar regulations were sustained in New York, O\\'Connor v. Hendrick, 184 N.Y. 421, 77 N.E. 612 (1906), and in New Mexico, Zellers v. Huff, 55 N.M. 501, 236 P.2d 949 (1951); challenges to tolerating religious dress in the classroom rather than to rules forbidding such dress were rejected in North Dakota, Gerhardt v. Heid, 66 N.D. 444, 267 N.W. 127 (1936); Indiana, State ex rel Johnson v. Boyd, 217 Ind. 348, 28 N.E.2d 256 (1940); Connecticut, New Haven v.

Board of Ed., 4 Ohio Misc. 257, 212 N.E.2d 833 (1965).\\nThe bare citations do not reveal their historic and embattled settings. In the Indiana case, the school trustees of the City of Vincennes took over parochial school buildings and paid the salaries of Roman Catholic teachers when those schools could not open during the depression year of 1933-34, confronting the trustees with \"an emergency to provide school facilities for more than 800 additional school children\" that the court found might well be temporary. State ex rel. Johnson v. Boyd, supra, 217 Ind. at 367, 28 N.E.2d 256. Decisions tolerating nuns\\' garb in the public schools were superseded by a popular referendum in North Dakota as well as by the legislature in Pennsylvania. Pfeffer, Church, State, and Freedom 413 (1953). Oregon\\'s 1923 predecessor to ORS 342.650 dates from the period of anti-Catholic intolerance that also gave us the initiative measure against private schools struck down in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925).\\nThe courts\\' tolerance of overt religious symbolism in public schools has differed over time and perhaps with the religious composition of different communities. Looking beyond the specific facts of the cases, however, the decisions generally have been that more than a teacher\\'s religious dress is needed to show a forbidden sectarian influence in the classroom, but that a rule against such religious dress is permissible to avoid the appearance of sectarian influence, favoritism, or official approval in the public school. The policy choice must be made in the first instance by those with lawmaking or delegated authority to make rules for the schools. The courts\\' role is to see whether the rule stays within that authority and within the constitution and, if necessary, to give the rule a constitutional interpretation.\\n\\nIII. RELIGIOUS NEUTRALITY IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS\\nHere the policy choice was made by the legislature. There is no reason to believe that when the Legislative Assembly enacted ORS 342.650 in its present form in 1965, it had any aim other than to maintain the religious neutrality of the public schools, to avoid giving children or their parents the impression that the school, through its teacher, approves and shares the religious commitment of one group and perhaps finds that of others less worthy.\\nIt would be easy to show that this aim has equal constitutional standing with the teacher\\'s religious self-expression if Oregon, like many states, had adopted an explicit constitutional guarantee against sectarian *309 influence in the public schools.[13] Such a provision was omitted from the education article, Article VIII, of the Oregon Constitution.\\nCarey\\'s compilation of the proceedings of the constitutional convention shows that the version of present Article VIII of the constitution, as reported on August 26, 1857, by the Committee on Education and School Lands, included a provision that instruction in state colleges and the common schools \"shall be free from party or sectarian bias.\" On September 2, a minority of the committee presented a version that would have forbidden religious standards criteria for schools and teachers in greater detail. Carey, The Oregon Constitution 179, 231 (1926).[14] The source of Oregon\\'s Article VIII, section 3, is reported to have been Article IX, section 3, of the Iowa Constitution of 1846, which contained no such provision, so the point seems to have had independent importance to the anti-sectarian members of the committee. The minority report was rejected by the convention, sitting in committee of the whole, on September 9. On September 12, the committee of the whole voted to strike the final words of the section, including the provision on \"sectarian bias,\" id. at 338, and this was done at the third reading of the education article on September 15, when the journal briefly reports:\\n\"On motion of Mr. Kelly, the president was authorized to erase all of the latter part of section 3, line four, after the word schools in said line, in the article on education and school lands.\"\\nId. at 354. There is no evidence of any explanation or debate of the deletion, and we have found no reference to it in the contemporaneous press accounts of the convention reprinted in Carey or in any other source. Because the stricken portion also specified that schooling between ages four and twenty-one should be free, the motion possibly focused more on cost than on the nonsectarian provision.\\nNonetheless, the aim of maintaining the religious neutrality of the public schools furthers a constitutional obligation beyond an ordinary policy preference of the legislature. It is the obligation stated in Article VIII, section 3, to provide for \"a uniform, and general system of Common Schools,\" which must be done without imposing on the religious freedom under Article I, sections 2 and 3, of the children who attend those schools. It is not necessary to debate how far the ban on fiscal support for religion stated in Article I, section 5, goes beyond narrow financial concerns to imply a larger principle against having government drawn into sponsorship of one or another religion. See Lowe v. City of Eugene, 254 Or. 518, 547-48, 451 P.2d 117, 463 P.2d 360 (1970). Government neutrality also serves to protect the \"free exercise, and enjoyment of religeous opinions,\" under Article I, section 3, of those whose opinions differ from what a majority might uncritically accept as the community\\'s \"official\" religion.\\n*310 Recognition that freedom of religion for all implies official sponsorship of none has grown with the growing diversity of the nation itself. Two hundred years ago religious toleration could mean toleration merely among Protestant denominations. See, e.g., Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, Art III (1780).[15] Even after Catholics, Jews, other minority faiths, and nonbelievers were accorded the right to follow their own views, toleration did not imply that their views were as good as the community\\'s dominant religion. For those to whom religion is a matter of truth or error rather than \"opinion,\" as the constitution says, to tolerate error did not mean that those in a position to speak for the community should not officially proclaim what they firmly believe to be the truth. Those whose faiths thereby would be relegated to second-class status of course might see freedom of religion differently.\\nThe main battleground has been the public schools, as the cases under the constitutional proscriptions of \"sectarian influence\" and later under the First Amendment show.[16] Parents and lawmakers may and do assume that the hours, days, and years spent in school are the time and the place when a young person is most impressionable by the expressed and implicit orthodoxies of the adult community and most sensitive to being perceived as different from the majority of his or her peers; famous constitutional cases have involved this socializing rather than intellectual function of the schools.[17] In excluding teachers whose dress is a constant and inescapable visual reminder of their religious commitment, laws like ORS 342.650 respect and contribute to the child\\'s right to the free exercise and enjoyment of its religious opinions or heritage, untroubled by being out of step with those of the teacher.\\nThe principle is most obvious when the teacher represents the community\\'s dominant religion, but it cannot be limited to that situation. From the \"Know-Nothing\" nativism of the mid-19th century, through the battle over the \"Blaine Amendment,\"[18] to recent times, contention centered on the role of Catholicism in public schools, symbolized by the dress of priests and nuns, as distinct from mainstream Protestantism, represented by school prayers and the King James translation of the Bible. See Pfeffer, supra, 374-82. It may *311 be a far cry from these historic conflicts to perceive any threat of sectarian influence in the dress of a sect that, in this country, may seem an exotic curiosity. But we are examining the validity of the law against a charge that it denies teachers the freedom to adopt the dress of their respective religions. Neither their religious freedom nor that of their students can depend on calculations which faiths are more likely than others to snatch a young soul from a rival creed. The tides of immigration and of homegrown religions have changed before and are changing again, and what is exotic today may tomorrow gain many thousands of adherents and potential majority status in some communities.[19]\\nIn other contexts we have held that expression that could not constitutionally be prohibited outright may nevertheless be found incompatible with the performance of an official professional role. In Burt v. Blumenauer, 299 Or. 55, 74, 699 P.2d 168 (1985), we recognized that public advocacy of a vote for or against a disputed ballot measure, normally the essence of individual free speech, may under narrowly defined circumstances be incompatible with an individual\\'s public duties. In re Lasswell, 296 Or. 121, 673 P.2d 855 (1983), held that a disciplinary rule prohibiting a prosecutor\\'s extrajudicial comments on a pending trial is not an unconstitutional infringement of free speech if it is narrowly limited to actual incompatibility between the speech and the prosecutor\\'s official function.[20] Interestingly enough, the issue of religious dress has arisen in trial courtrooms as well as in classrooms when a Catholic priest who was a member of the bar asserted the right to appear in his religious garb. See La Rocca v. Lane, 37 N.Y.2d 575, 376 N.Y.S.2d 93, 338 N.E.2d 606 (1975), cert. den. 424 U.S. 968, 96 S.Ct. 1464, 47 L.Ed.2d 734 (1976); People v. Rodriguez, 101 Misc.2d 536, 424 N.Y.S.2d 600 (1979); Gold v. McShane, 74 A.D.2d 860, 426 N.Y. S.2d 504 (1980), in which the New York courts apparently left the issue to the discretion of individual trial courts.\\nWe conclude that ORS 342.650 does not impose an impermissible requirement for teaching in the public schools if it is properly limited to actual incompatibility with the teaching function.\\n\\nIV. THE PERMISSIBLE REACH OF ORS 342.650\\nA court\\'s obligation before invalidating a textually overbroad statute is to see whether it can be interpreted so as to save the legislative purpose as far as the constitution permits, leaving only marginal instances of potentially unconstitutional application *312 to case-by-case decision. State v. Moyle, 299 Or. 691, 702, 705 P.2d 740 (1985). The Court of Appeals recognized the need to limit the potential reach of ORS 342.650. Compliance with the statute demands some sacrifice of religious self-expression by a teacher. The statute, of course, does not forbid the wearing of religious dress outright, but it does forbid doing so while teaching. The law could be described either as denying a teacher\\'s right to practice her religion or as denying a person demonstratively committed to a religious vocation the opportunity to teach in the public schools. The two descriptions may invite different responses, but the issue should not hinge on semantics.\\nTo forbid a teacher to disclose personal views that are identified as such and not attributed to the school, including religious views, involves issues of free speech as well as religion. A program hermetically sealed to exclude all controversy and potentially offensive ideas can hardly be defended as education for the world beyond the classroom. Teachers as well as students have been held free to express their objection to national policy symbolically by their dress.[21] A distinction between privileged personal expression and forbidden \"indoctrination\" or \"proselytizing\" is easier to assert than to apply; one teacher\\'s personal views and acts can carry more unintended persuasion than another\\'s most determined teaching efforts. Yet if Janet Cooper on December 6, 1983, only had told her class that she had changed her name because she became a Sikh and what this meant, the school district could hardly have discharged her in order to protect her pupils against religious proselytizing. To disqualify her from teaching under ORS 342.650 for dressing as a Sikh one must find greater significance in the forbidden religious dress than in the verbal religious self-identification.\\nThe Court of Appeals stated this greater significance as follows:\\n\"We therefore construe the term `religious dress\\' to mean clothing that is associated with, and symbolic of, religion. To be symbolic, the clothes must communicate the wearer\\'s adherence to a particular religion. We construe `while in the performance of his duties as a teacher\\' to include only those duties which systematically bring the teacher, as a teacher, into contact with students.\" (Footnote omitted).\\n76 Or.App. at 150-51, 708 P.2d 1161. We agree with this interpretation as far as it goes, but more needs to be added. The quoted paragraph correctly recognizes that \"religious dress\" must be judged from the perspective both of the wearer and of the observer, that it is dress which is worn by reason of its religious importance to the teacher and also conveys to children of the age, background, and sophistication typical of students in the teacher\\'s class a degree of religious commitment beyond the choice to wear common decorations that a person might draw from a religious heritage, such as a necklace with a small cross or Star of David. A teacher does not violate the statute by wearing a garment or a color that unintentionally happens to imply membership in some religious group, nor, for instance, by dressing in clerical garb to assume a role in a classroom historical exercise or a performance of, say, George Bernard Shaw\\'s Saint Joan.\\nThe quoted formulation also recognizes that the \"performance of his duties as a teacher\" does not include everything that a teacher is paid to do and every hour during which he does it. Under the principles already discussed, the phrase must be confined to those circumstances when a teacher\\'s dressing in accordance with the standards of his or her religion is truly incompatible with the school\\'s commitment to maintaining for its students the atmosphere of religious freedom and neutrality that is the objective of ORS 342.650. This means appearing in religious dress while *313 dealing directly with children in a teaching or counseling role.\\nThe additional element not stated in the opinion of the Court of Appeals is the continual or frequent repetition of a teacher\\'s appearance in specifically religious (not merely ethnic) dress. The religious influence on children while in the public school that laws like ORS 342.650, in their concern with the employment of nuns wearing their special garb as public school teachers, legitimately seek to prevent is not the mere knowledge that a teacher is an adherent of a particular religion. Their concern is that the teacher\\'s appearance in religious garb may leave a conscious or unconscious impression among young people and their parents that the school endorses the particular religious commitment of the person whom it has assigned the public role of teacher. This is what makes the otherwise privileged display of a teacher\\'s religious commitment by her dress incompatible with the atmosphere of religious neutrality that ORS 342.650 aims to preserve, or so the school authorities may decide. The statute therefore would not be violated whenever a teacher makes an occasional appearance in religious dress, for instance on her way to or from a seasonal ceremony. It is the same distinction as that between an occasional religious meeting, parade or brief display in a public park or building and the permanent erection of a religious symbol, as in Lowe v. City of Eugene, supra. Only wearing religious dress as a regular or frequently repeated practice while teaching is grounds for disqualification.\\n\\nV. CONCLUSION\\nWe conclude that, when correctly interpreted and applied, ORS 342.650 survives challenge under Oregon\\'s guarantees of religious freedom. As interpreted in this opinion, we believe it also does not violate the federal First Amendment.\\nThe Court of Appeals thought that revocation of a teaching certificate was an excessive \"sanction\" discouraging even privileged exercise of First Amendment rights more than is necessary to achieve the law\\'s purpose of maintaining religious freedom and neutrality in the public schools. We do not disagree with the court\\'s general proposition that First Amendment decisions have required limitations on the exercise of First Amendment rights to be no more restrictive than necessary, although we note, as the district argues, that the decisions deal with the coverage of such limitations rather than with the consequence of violating a valid rule.\\nORS 342.650 might indeed restrict a teacher\\'s First Amendment rights to the \"free exercise\" of religion more than necessary if it were applied literally, but where ORS 342.650 can validly be applied, the revocation of a teaching certificate under ORS 342.655 is not a penalty. It is not a withdrawal of a privilege by reason of hostility to a religious or political belief, as when some states disqualified Communists from driving or practicing pharmacy or from living in public housing. See Lawson v. Housing Authority of City of Milwaukee, 270 Wis. 269, 70 N.W.2d 605 (1955); 1 Emerson &amp; Haber, Political and Civil Rights in the United States 547-552 (2d ed 1958). It is a disqualification from teaching in public schools based on one\\'s doing so in a manner incompatible with that function.[22] We doubt that the First Amendment draws a line between a law that disqualifies a public school teacher by compelling her discharge and another law that disqualifies her by revoking her certificate to teach in the public schools. ORS *314 342.655 does not forbid requalifying for a certificate.\\nInsofar as the decision of the Court of Appeals strikes down ORS 342.655 on that premise, it must be reversed. As already noted, on the record in this proceeding the question whether Cooper\\'s conduct would disqualify her is not before us. The determination that a teacher has violated ORS 342.650 is made by the school district. No argument has been presented to us why that determination is reviewable by the Superintendent. Because ORS 342.650 and 342.655 can be interpreted to remain within constitutional limits and can be constitutionally administered, the Superintendent\\'s order pursuant to ORS 342.655 is not unlawful for being based on an invalid statute. ORS 183.482(8)(a). The Superintendent\\'s subsequent conditional reinstatement of Janet Cooper\\'s teaching certificate also is not before us in this proceeding. Whatever hypothetical legal issues might arise should she choose to resume teaching in Oregon will have to await the event; perhaps no one would call her certification to do so into question.\\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Cooper also had married and had changed her name to Karta Kaur Khalsa.\\n[2]  See, e.g., Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Res., 297 Or. 562, 687 P.2d 785 (1984). In Neuhaus v. Federico, 12 Or.App. 314, 505 P.2d 939 (1973), the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to enter the then raging dispute over the constitutionality of school hair length rules because the authority of school boards was limited to enacting rules related to the educational process.\\n[3]  The 1971 statute allows \"suspension\" only for some of the causes that justify dismissal, and the suspension must be followed within five days by dismissal proceedings or reinstatements. ORS 342.865, 342.875. Violation of ORS 342.650 is not one of the grounds listed in ORS 342.865. The effect of the 1971 statute on ORS 342.655, and the duration of a \"suspension\" under that section, have not been briefed or discussed by the parties or by the Court of Appeals.\\n[4]  For instance, a district might want to reinstate a teacher who has been \"suspended\" and therefore object to the statutory revocation of the teacher\\'s certificate that prevents reinstatement, or it might fear civil liability if ORS 342.650, under which it suspended the teacher, were to be invalidated in a revocation proceeding in which the district failed to appear.\\n[5]  \" * * * When a tribunal passes upon constitutional applicability, it is carrying out the legislative intent, either express or implied or presumed. When a tribunal passes upon constitutionality of the legislation, the question is whether it shall take action which runs counter to the legislative intent. We commit to administrative agencies the power to determine constitutional applicability, but we do not commit to administrative agencies the power to determine constitutionality of legislation. Only the courts have authority to take action which runs counter to the expressed will of the legislative body.\" (Footnote omitted.)\\n\\n3 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise 74, \u00a7 20.04 (1958).\\n[6]  See, e.g., Note, The Authority of Administrative Agencies to Consider the Constitutionality of Statutes, 90 Harv.L.Rev. 1682 (1977).\\n[7]  Article IV, section 31 of the Oregon Constitution provides:\\n\\n\"The members of the Legislative Assembly shall before they enter on the duties of their respective offices, take and subscribe the following oath or affirmation;\\x97I do solemnly swear (or affirm as the case may be) that I will support the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the State of Oregon, * * *.\"\\nArticle XV, section 3 of the Oregon Constitution provides:\\n\"Every person elected or appointed to any office under this Constitution, shall, before entering on the duties thereof, take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution of the United States and of this State, and also an oath of office.\"\\nAs these provisions show, the constitution does not contemplate that legislators and officials will act as they think best and leave the constitutionality of their acts to the courts. Courts may have the last word in interpreting the constitution, but Chief Justice Marshall\\'s defense of \"the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is,\" Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), did not imply that constitutional law is the province and duty only of the judicial department, leaving Congress and executive officials unconstrained to pursue their ends subject only to judicial review. See Brest, The Conscientious Legislator\\'s Guide to Constitutional Interpretation, 27 Stan.L.Rev. 585 (1975); Mikva &amp; Lundy, The 91st Congress and the Constitution, 38 U.Chi.L.Rev. 449 (1971); Morgan, Congress and the Constitution 10 (1966). The Superintendent of Public Instruction himself holds a constitutional office, Or.Const., Art. VIII, \u00a7 1, and must satisfy himself that he conducts it in accordance with the constitution.\\nOur recent decision in OEA v. Roberts, 301 Or. 228, 721 P.2d 833 (1986) involved a somewhat different example of an official\\'s responsibility to apply a constitutional test, because there the Secretary of State was held responsible for applying the constitutional \"single subject rule,\" Or Const. Art. IV, \u00a7 1(2)(d), not the constitutionality of a statute assigning that duty to her.\\n[8]  ORS 183.484(3) provides:\\n\\n\"The petition shall state the nature of the petitioner\\'s interest, the facts showing how the petitioner is adversely affected or aggrieved by the agency order and the ground or grounds upon which the petitioner contends the order should be reversed or remanded. The review shall proceed and be conducted by the court without a jury.\"\\nThe appellate courts\\' rules assume that a petitioner objects to the agency\\'s order when they require that the petition \"be accompanied by a copy of the order, rule or ruling from which the appeal is taken.\" ORAP 5.10(4) (Emphasis added.) An \"appeal\" from an order does not encompass a petition to a court to affirm an order.\\n[9]  Again, the record does not show and neither the parties nor the Court of Appeals discuss on what basis the Superintendent believed that he had authority to reinstate a certificate revoked under ORS 342.655 for a violation of ORS 342.650.\\n\\nThe district relies on Perry v. Oregon Liquor Commission, 180 Or. 495, 499, 177 P.2d 406 (1947) for the proposition that a court will decide a moot case \"for the guidance of an official administrative agency\" in a matter of public welfare that is likely to arise again. More recent decisions have not followed Perry; see, e.g., Hay v. Dept. of Transportation, 301 Or. 129, 134, 719 P.2d 860 (1986); State ex rel Oregonian Publishing Co. v. Sams, 298 Or. 329, 332, 692 P.2d 116 (1984). Legal advice or \"guidance\" to agencies is the Attorney General\\'s assignment. ORS 180.060(2).\\nWe do not in this opinion pursue Cooper\\'s contention in the Court of Appeals with respect to the compatibility of ORS 342.650 and 342.655 with Title VII, because the conditional reinstatement of her teaching certificate and the narrowing construction that we give to ORS 342.650 substantially change the character of her possible argument under that statute.\\n[10]  Even the most committed strict constructionist of the constitutional text doubtless would fail the challenge to read \"men\" to exclude \"women,\" at least unless there were a clear record of such an intention. See State v. Chase, 106 Or. 263, 271, 211 P. 920 (1922) (women became \"freemen\" and the \"peers\" of men for jury service upon gaining political rights).\\n[11]  Amendment I to the United States Constitution provides:\\n\\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; * * *.\"\\n[12]  In determining whether to reach a federal constitutional claim without first disposing of all issues of state law, including the state\\'s constitution, one must distinguish three questions: (1) whether an issue has been raised at all; (2) whether any state source has been cited in connection with the issue; (3) whether an argument has been made in support of the state claim.\\n\\nAn issue that is not raised at all, even on a generous reading, presents nothing to be decided (although an appellate opinion may note that the issue was not raised so as to make clear that the case is not a precedent on the question).\\nIf the issue has been raised in general terms, for instance, that a defendant claims a right to \"equal protection\" or to counsel, or against self-incrimination or double jeopardy, the claim could refer to several statutory or constitutional rules. We have emphasized that parties should specify the statutory or constitutional sources of their claims, see Sterling v. Cupp, 290 Or. 611, 613 n. 1, 625 P.2d 123 (1981) (citing cases), but also that a party cannot, by omitting a state-based claim, force an Oregon court to hold that this state \"has fallen below a nationwide constitutional standard, when in fact the state\\'s law, when properly invoked, meets or exceeds that standard.\" State v. Kennedy; 295 Or. 260, 267, 666 P.2d 1316 (1983). When only the disposition of a single case is involved, a court \"may request counsel either to explain the claim under the state law or to abandon it,\" and \"if it is abandoned the court can note that fact so that the decision at least will not be a precedent on that issue.\" Id. at 268, 666 P.2d 1316.\\nA court, however, is not confined to choosing only among the arguments and authorities cited by counsel for or against a properly identified claim. See, e.g., State v. Bennett, 301 Or. 299, 721 P.2d 1375 (1986) (Jones, J., concurring). Courts can avoid taking parties by surprise by inviting additional memoranda on inadequately briefed questions, as this court frequently does. That course should be followed whenever a litigant asks a court to invalidate a state statute or rule under the federal constitution without briefing its validity, or a possible valid interpretation, under applicable state law. See, e.g., Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Res., supra, n. 2.\\n[13]  Many state constitutions expressly forbid sectarian influence in the public schools. Characteristic phrases are found in California\\'s Art. 9, \u00a7 8 (\"nor shall any sectarian or denominational doctrine be taught, or instruction thereon be permitted, directly or indirectly, in and of the common schools of this State\"); Nevada\\'s Article 11, \u00a7 9 (\"No sectarian instruction shall be imparted or tolerated\" in the public schools); Washington\\'s Article 9, \u00a7 4 (Public schools \"shall be forever free from sectarian control or influence\"). See generally, Antieau, Carroll &amp; Burke, Religion Under the State Constitutions (1965).\\n[14]  The minority report, located in the files of the Oregon Historical Society, would have provided:\\n\\n\"No division of the common school fund, or of any annual apportionment, shall ever be made at the instance of, or for the use and benefit of, any religious sect or persuasion.\\n\"No distinction in the selection of incumbents for office in any department of the common school system, or in the eligibility of instructors, or in the privileges of patrons and pupils shall ever be made on account of religious opinion, provided such religious opinion be not against the police, peace, and dignity of the state.\\n\"No sectarian influence in behalf of or against any religious tenet or persuasion shall be inculcated in any common school in this state.\"\\n[15]  At the time of Oregon\\'s constitutional convention, United States Supreme Court Justice Story still could write that the purpose of the First Amendment was \"not to countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity; but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects.\" 2 J.

The approximate numbers of Buddhists in the United States increased from 30,000 to 180,000, Muslims from 10,000 to about 1,600,000, Hindus from 1,000 to about 400,000. World Christian Encyclopedia 711 (D.B. Barrett, ed. 1982). Among specifically American denominations that have evolved since Oregon became a state, Mormon church membership grew from a few thousand in 1840 to about 200,000 in 1900 and 1,500,000 in 1960. Christian Science churches and societies, which did not exist before 1879, numbered about 2,300 in 1960. Gaustad, Historical Atlas of Religion in America 87, 132 (1962).\\n[20]  \"The point of the disciplinary rule, therefore, is not restraint of free expression by lawyers because they are lawyers. That could not survive the constitutional principles we reviewed in In re Richmond, 285 Or. 469, 474-75, 591 P.2d 728 (1979). Rather, the rule addresses the incompatibility between a prosecutor\\'s official function, including his responsibility to preserve the conditions for a fair trial, and speech that, though privileged against other than professional sanctions, vitiates the proper performance of that function under the circumstances of the specific case. In short, a lawyer is not denied freedom to speak, write, or publish; but when one exercises official responsibility for conducting a prosecution according to constitutional standards, one also undertakes the professional responsibility to protect those standards in what he or she says or writes. We conclude that DR 7-107(B) survives the accused\\'s constitutional challenge if it is narrowly interpreted so as to limit its coverage, in the words of article I, section 8, to a prosecutor\\'s `abuse\\' of the right `to speak, write, or print freely on any subject whatever.\\'\"\\n\\nIn re Lasswell, 296 Or. 121, 125, 673 P.2d 855 (1983).\\n[21]  Tinker v.

Similar issues arise in other contexts and call for refinement of standards by administrative rules or by reasoned decisions, see Ross v. Springfield School District, 300 Or. 507, 716 P.2d 724 (1986), and we assume that a district will not discharge a teacher under ORS 342.650 without prior warning that her conduct may require it. Of course, it is also possible that the concerned groups will relieve the remaining doubts by pursuing legislative amendment or repeal of the two statutes.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 1318757}]"},{"id":2661001,"date_filed":"2013-03-07","judges":"Judge Reggie B.

BACKGROUND\\n\\n         A. The Plaintiff\u2019s Factual Allegations 2\\n\\n                  1. The Plaintiff\u2019s Tenure at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center\\n\\n         The plaintiff is a board-certified \u201cdiagnostic radiolog[ist] with prior 23-year active and\\n\\nreserve service as a general diagnostic radiologist with the United States Army.\u201d 2011 Compl.\\n\\n\u00b6 2. Among other hospital positions, she \u201cworked as a staff [r]adiologist at Walter Reed Army\\n\\nMedical Center\u201d (\u201cWalter Reed\u201d) from April 6, 2007 until November 4, 2007. Second Am.\\n\\nCompl. \u00b6 1. Shortly before the end of the plaintiff\u2019s tour of duty at Walter Reed, Colonel\\n\\n(\u201cCol.\u201d) Michael Brazaitis, the Chief of Radiology at Walter Reed, \u201ccompleted a rating of [the\\n\\np]laintiff\u2019s clinical performance dated [November 1, 2007]\u201d using a military performance\\n\\nassessment form for medical personnel called a DA Form 5374. Id. \u00b6 11. In the \u201cremarks\u201d\\n\\nsection of the DA Form 5374, Col. Brazaitis wrote the following:\\n\\n         A peer review audit was performed encompassing one week of Neuroradiology\\n         cases performed by the provider. Significant discrepancies were identified in 4 of\\n         the 53 cases performed by the provider (7.5%). The provider\u2019s expertise is in\\n         Pediatric Neuroradiology. The cases evaluated reflect the usual workload\\n         performed at [Walter Reed], which is predominantly adult and trauma\\n         Neuroradiology. If the provider practices outside of her area of expertise,\\n         supervision should be provided until such time as performance is deemed\\n         acceptable for the case mix at that institution.\\n\\nId.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  This Memorandum Opinion addresses two cases, Budik v. United States, No. 11-1268 (D.D.C. filed Nov. 13,\\n2009) and Budik v. Donley, No. 11-1865 (D.D.C. filed Oct. 21, 2011), which the Court has consolidated, January\\n25, 2012 Minute Order, Budik v. United States, No. 11-1268. Because the plaintiff did not file an amended\\nconsolidated complaint, and in light of the plaintiff\u2019s pro se status, the Court will consider and address the\\nallegations contained in the operative complaints in each case. The Court additionally will consider and address the\\nallegations contained in the First Amended Complaint in Budik v. United States, which is incorporated by reference\\ninto the Second Amended Complaint in that same case.\\n\\n\\n                                                         2\\n\\x0c       In March 2008, the plaintiff \u201cfiled a complaint with the Inspector General at [Walter\\n\\nReed] for lack of substantiation regarding [Col. Brazaitis\u2019s] remarks,\u201d alleging that the remarks\\n\\n\u201cconstitute[d] an adverse privileging action, [and also did not] afford[] [the p]laintiff due\\n\\nprocess.\u201d Id. \u00b6 13. The Walter Reed Inspector General\u2019s Office responded to the complaint in a\\n\\nJuly 17, 2008 letter to the plaintiff. Id. \u00b6 14; First Am. Compl., Attachment (\u201cAttach.\u201d) 3 (July\\n\\n17, 2008 Letter). The letter related the chronology and findings of the investigation conducted\\n\\nby the Walter Reed Inspector General\u2019s Office and concluded that \u201c[b]ased on the information\\n\\ngathered during this inquiry, [the plaintiff was] afforded due process during [her] initial\\n\\ncredentialing year at [Walter Reed].\u201d First Am. Compl., Attach. 3 (July 17, 2008 Letter). The\\n\\nletter additionally stated that further requests for information \u201cshould be directed to the\\n\\nDepartment of the Army Inspector General . . . Records Release Office . . . under the Freedom of\\n\\nInformation A[ct].\u201d Id.\\n\\n               2. The Plaintiff\u2019s Application for Privileges at Malcolm Grow Medical Center\\n\\n       The plaintiff applied for a \u201ccivilian position as a contract, board-certified general\\n\\ndiagnostic radiologist at Malcolm Grow Medical Center\u201d (\u201cMalcolm Grow\u201d) at Andrews Air\\n\\nForce Base on August 13, 2008, through Malcolm Grow\u2019s \u201ccontracting agency[,] Sterling\\n\\nMedical.\u201d 2011 Compl. \u00b6 9. At the beginning of the process, Sterling Medical requested that the\\n\\nplaintiff \u201csign an \u2018Agreement for Service\u2019 \u2018to reserve the position\u2019 at\u201d Malcolm Grow. Id. \u00b6 10.\\n\\n       As part of the plaintiff\u2019s application, the plaintiff was required to attend a \u201csite visit\u201d at\\n\\nMalcolm Grow, even though such \u201cvisits [were] prohibited\u201d and \u201conly telephonic interviews\\n\\nwere authorized.\u201d 2011 Compl. \u00b6 11. The plaintiff nonetheless attended the visit, and \u201c[m]ost of\\n\\nthe time spent during the interview focused on procedures, policies and practices\u201d at Malcolm\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 3\\n\\x0cGrow. Id. \u00b6 13. At least part of the visit included \u201ca brief discussion about mammography\u201d for\\n\\nwhich the plaintiff required a re-certification and which the defendant stated she \u201ccould complete\\n\\n. . . on the job.\u201d Id. It was during the site visit that the \u201c[d]efendant learned of [the p]laintiff\u2019s\\n\\nrace, color, sex, and age.\u201d Id. \u00b6 11.\\n\\n        Malcolm Grow subsequently obtained additional information about the plaintiff and her\\n\\nqualifications from Walter Reed, as well as from another military hospital at which the plaintiff\\n\\nhad worked, Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (\u201cLandstuhl Regional\u201d). Id. \u00b6 17 (identified in\\n\\nthe 2011 Complaint as the \u201cLMRC\u201d). The information was obtained through \u201ccollegial\\n\\nchannels,\u201d as opposed to having been acquired from Sterling Medical. Id. Although the DA\\n\\nForm 5374 that Malcolm Grow received from Landstuhl Regional, which was completed by\\n\\nLieutenant Colonel (\u201cLt. Col.\u201d) Ricanthony Ashley, \u201ccontained a derogatory statement,\u201d the\\n\\ndefendants also had knowledge of another DA Form 5374 completed by Lt. Col. Ashley that was\\n\\nidentical to the first form with the exception that it did not contain the derogatory statement. Id.\\n\\n\u00b6 19. The defendants \u201cquestioned why . . . seemingly conflicting references\u201d would be submitted\\n\\nbut \u201cdid not act on it,\u201d even after being informed \u201cthat the derogatory statement was forged.\u201d 3\\n\\nId. \u00b6 20.\\n\\n        Malcolm Grow also obtained the uncomplimentary DA Form 5374 from Walter Reed\\n\\nthat had been completed by Col. Brazaitis. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 21-23. In addition, Malcolm Grow obtained\\n\\nanother \u201creference from [Walter Reed],\u201d which contained \u201c[n]o derogatory information\\n\\nwhatsoever.\u201d Id. \u00b6 24. No one at Malcolm Grow questioned the \u201cconflicting references.\u201d Id.\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n It was later discovered that the statement was not forged. Supplemental Attach. to First Am. Compl. at 17-18, No.\\n11-cv-1268 (D.D.C. Dec. 7, 2011), ECF No. 49 (April 2, 2009 Declaration of Col. Ricanthony Ashley)). The\\nLandstuhl Regional performance assessment is the subject of another matter currently pending before this Court.\\n\\n\\n                                                        4\\n\\x0c        While the plaintiff\u2019s application was pending, Malcolm Grow received a telephone call\\n\\nfrom Col. Les Folio, who provided \u201ca negative reference\u201d regarding the plaintiff. Id. \u00b6 25.\\n\\nAccording to the plaintiff, Col. Folio \u201cdid not have the requisite personal or professional contact\\n\\nwith [the p]laintiff to assess [her performance].\u201d Id. \u00b6 26.\\n\\n        The plaintiff was notified that she had been denied privileges to practice at Malcolm\\n\\nGrow on October 8, 2008. Id. \u00b6 27. The reasons cited included the unfavorable performance\\n\\nassessments received from Walter Reed and Landstuhl Regional, as well as the plaintiff\u2019s need to\\n\\nre-qualify in mammography. Id. \u00b6 28. The plaintiff subsequently filed a complaint with the\\n\\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), claiming unlawful discrimination. Id.,\\n\\nAttach. 2 (EEOC Judgment) at 2. The EEOC found that the plaintiff \u201cfailed to establish by a\\n\\npreponderance of the evidence that any or all of the Claims cited [in the plaintiff\u2019s EEOC\\n\\ncomplaint] amount to a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination in the selection process\\n\\nbased on her race, color, or sex.\u201d Id., Attach. 2 (EEOC Judgment) at 10.\\n\\n                 3. The Plaintiff\u2019s Continued Attempts To Amend her Military Records\\n\\n        In January 2009, the plaintiff met with the Commander at Walter Reed, Col. Norvell V.\\n\\nCoots, MD, to discuss both Col. Brazaitis\u2019s remarks on her performance assessment form and the\\n\\ndisclosure of that form to Malcolm Grow. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 15. Col. Coots indicated \u201cthat\\n\\nhe would conduct a 15-6 investigation\u201d 4 to review the initial investigation conducted by the\\n\\nInspector General at Walter Reed. Id. \u00b6 15. After reviewing the initial investigation, but\\n\\nwithout performing the 15-6 investigation, id. \u00b6 16, Col. Coots informed the plaintiff in an April\\n\\n23, 2009 letter that he was \u201csatisfied with the validity of the [Inspector General\u2019s] investigation\\n4\\n A \u201c15-6 investigation\u201d is an investigation conducted pursuant to Army Regulation 15-6 (2006), which \u201cestablishes\\nprocedures for investigations and boards of officers not specifically authorized by any other directive.\u201d Army Reg.\\n15-6, \u00b6 1-1.\\n\\n\\n                                                        5\\n\\x0cand with its results. Therefore, there will be no need to initiate a new investigation,\u201d First Am.\\n\\nCompl., Attach. 5 (April 23, 2009 Letter).\\n\\n         Through counsel, the plaintiff challenged Col. Coots\u2019s determination that a new\\n\\ninvestigation was not warranted. 5 First Am. Compl., Attachs. 6a-6c (June 2, 2009, June 24, 2009\\n\\nand July 13, 2009 Letters). Col. Scott F. Young, the Center Judge Advocate at Walter Reed,\\n\\nstated that \u201c[i]f [the plaintiff] believes that an error or injustice exist[ed]\u201d in her records, \u201cshe\\n\\nmay petition the Army Board for Correction of Military Records for relief . . . within 3 years\\n\\nafter [the] alleged error or injustice [was] discovered or reasonably should have been\\n\\ndiscovered.\u201d First Am. Compl., Attach. 6b (June 24, 2009 Letter).\\n\\n         The plaintiff had already filed a petition with the Army Board for Correction of Military\\n\\nRecords (\u201cArmy Board\u201d) in a letter dated June 5, 2009. 6 2011 Compl. \u00b6 30; First Am. Compl.,\\n\\nAttach. 7 (June 5, 2009 Letter). The June 5, 2009 letter stated that the \u201cperformance evaluation\\n\\nwritten by Col. Brazaitis . . . ha[d] adversely affected [her] ability to obtain\u201d a position. First\\n\\nAm. Compl., Attach. 7 (June 5, 2009 Letter). She alleged that the \u201cremarks in section . . . 14\u201d of\\n\\nthe performance assessment were \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d \u201crestrictive,\u201d and inconsistent with other\\n\\nperformance evaluations completed during the same time period. Id. The plaintiff\u2019s request for\\n\\ncorrection of her records was denied on August 4, 2009. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 17; First Am.\\n\\nCompl., Ex. 8 (August 4, 2009 Letter).\\n\\n5\\n  Although Loretta Townsend, an attorney with the law firm of Weinstock, Friedman & Friedman, P.A.,\\ncorresponded with the Center Judge Advocate at Walter Reed on behalf of the plaintiff, Ms. Townsend stated in her\\nJuly 13, 2009 letter that correspondence from the Center Judge Advocate should be directed to the plaintiff, \u201cas she\\nis not presently our client in this matter.\u201d First Am. Compl., Attach. 6c (July 13, 2009 Letter) at 2.\\n6\\n It appears from the June 5, 2009 letter that the plaintiff had previously filed a request to amend her military record\\nwith respect to another performance assessment. First Am. Compl., Attach. 7 (June 5, 2007 Letter). As previously\\nnoted, that performance assessment, completed by Lt. Col. Ashley, is the subject of another lawsuit before this\\nCourt, and will not be addressed in this memorandum opinion.\\n\\n\\n                                                           6\\n\\x0c         Shortly thereafter, on August 12, 2009, the plaintiff filed a judicial complaint against the\\n\\nDepartment of the Army challenging the Department\u2019s failure to provide her with records that\\n\\nshe had requested pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (2006).\\n\\nBudik v. Dep\u2019t of Army, 742 F. Supp. 2d 20, 23-24 (D.D.C. 2010). Another member of this\\n\\nCourt found that, among other documents, the Department of the Army was required to produce\\n\\nto the plaintiff eight documents from Walter Reed, id. at 28, 37, among which were documents\\n\\nfrom the plaintiff\u2019s Provider Credentials File, Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 19. The plaintiff\\n\\nsubsequently received a copy of her Provider Credentials File pursuant to the Order issued in\\n\\nBudik, 742 F. Supp. 2d at 40. Id. \u00b6 19; First Am. Compl., Attach. 10 (December 7, 2010 Letter).\\n\\nHowever, the \u201cpeer review document,\u201d i.e., Col. Brazaitis\u2019s performance assessment of Col.\\n\\nBudik, was \u201cnot contained in the file.\u201d Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 19.\\n\\n         On August 4, 2010, the plaintiff filed a request for reconsideration from the Army Board\\n\\nof its August 4, 2009 denial of her initial request to amend her military record. Second Am.\\n\\nCompl. \u00b6 18. The request for reconsideration was denied on October 27, 2011. Id.\\n\\n         B. The Current Lawsuits\\n\\n         The plaintiff subsequently filed two lawsuits. First, she filed a lawsuit relating to the\\n\\nWalter Reed records. The matter was originally filed against Col. Brazaitis in the Circuit Court\\n\\nfor Howard County, Maryland, before being removed to the United States District Court for the\\n\\nDistrict of Maryland. Notice of Removal at 1-2, No. 11-1268, ECF No. 1. 7 The District of\\n\\nMaryland granted the defendants\u2019 motion to substitute the United States as the appropriate\\n\\ndefendant, November 20, 2009 Order at 1, No. 11-cv-1268, ECF No. 11; March 25, 2010 Order\\n7\\n  For ease of reference, citations to the documents on the dockets of Budik v.

Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff also filed a lawsuit against\\n\\nthe Secretary of the United States Department of the Air Force in response to her non-selection\\n\\nfor the position at Malcolm Grow.\\n\\n       In these two cases, the plaintiff asserts against the United States and the Secretary for the\\n\\nUnited States Department for the Air Force violations of the Privacy Act, improper disclosure of\\n\\nmedical quality assurance records, violations of various military regulations, due process\\n\\nviolations under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and\\n\\nclaims improper refusal to amend her military records, and additionally asserts against the\\n\\nSecretary of the Department of the Air Force alone unlawful discrimination in violation of Title\\n\\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 2011 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-39; Second Am.

Treatment of Pro Se Pleadings\\n\\n       The pleadings of pro se parties are to be \u201cliberally construed, and a pro se complaint,\\n\\nhowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted\\n\\nby lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (internal quotation marks and citations\\n\\nomitted). However, even though a pro se complaint must be construed liberally, the complaint\\n\\nmust still \u201cpresent a claim on which the Court can grant relief.\u201d Chandler v. Roche, 215 F. Supp.\\n\\n2d 166, 168 (D.D.C. 2002) (citing Crisafi v. Holland, 655 F.2d 1305, 1308 (D.C. Cir. 1981)).\\n\\n       B. Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss\\n\\n       When a defendant moves for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1),\\n\\n\u201cthe plaintiff[ ] bear[s] the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the Court\\n\\nhas subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Biton v.

A court\\n\\nconsidering a Rule 12(b)(1) motion must \u201cassume the truth of all material factual allegations in\\n\\nthe complaint and \u2018construe the complaint liberally, granting [a] plaintiff the benefit of all\\n\\ninferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.\u2019\u201d Am.

FDA, 402\\n\\nF.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (citing Herbert v.

Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss\\n\\n       A Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion tests whether the complaint \u201cstate[s] a\\n\\nclaim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). \u201cTo survive a motion to\\n\\ndismiss [under Rule 12(b)(6)], a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\\n\\ntrue, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\\n\\n(2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). A claim is facially\\n\\nplausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw [a] reasonable\\n\\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S.\\n\\nat 556). While the Court must \u201cassume [the] veracity\u201d of any \u201cwell-pleaded factual allegations\u201d\\n\\nin the complaint, conclusory allegations \u201care not entitled to the assumption of truth.\u201d Id. at 679.\\n\\n                                     III. LEGAL ANALYSIS\\n\\n       A. Substitution of the United States as the Defendant\\n\\n       The defendants argue that \u201c[t]he issue of whether [Col.] Brazaitis was acting properly\\n\\nwithin the scope of his employment is . . . settled\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Maryland district court\u2019s\\n\\ndecision to transfer was proper and has become the law of the case.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 23. The\\n\\nplaintiff responds that her claims against Col. Brazaitis \u201cfor fraud, infliction of emotional\\n\\ndistress, exceeding authority, and not following Army regulations are inconsistent with [Col.\\n\\nBrazaitis] acting within his scope of duties,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 11, and requests that the case be\\n\\ntransferred back to Maryland state court, Second Am. Compl., Prayer for Relief \u00b6 2.\\n\\n       Under the \u201claw-of-the-case\u201d doctrine, \u201c\u2018the same issue presented a second time in the\\n\\nsame case in the same court should lead to the same result.\u2019\u201d Sherley v. Sebelius, 689 F.3d 776,\\n\\n780-81 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting LaShawn A. v. Barry, 87 F.3d 1389, 1393 (D.C. Cir. 1996)\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  10\\n\\x0c(original emphasis)). The \u201cdoctrine reaches beyond the court that made the first decision. It\\n\\napplies just as strongly to coordinate courts.\u201d LaShawn A., 87 F.3d at 1393 n.3 (citing\\n\\nChristianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816 (1988)). Although \u201c[a] court has\\n\\nthe power to revisit prior decisions of its own or of a coordinate court in any circumstance, . . .\\n\\n[it] should be loathe to do so in the absence of extraordinary circumstances such as where the\\n\\ninitial decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d Christianson, 486\\n\\nU.S. at 817 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\n\\n       On the basis of the representations made in the defendants\u2019 Motion to Substitute\\n\\nDefendants, the District of Maryland determined that the United States should be substituted as\\n\\nthe defendant in the place of Col. Brazaitis. November 20, 2009 Order at 1, No. 11-1268, ECF\\n\\nNo. 11; March 25, 2010 Order at 1, No. 11-1268, ECF No. 21. The plaintiff is correct when she\\n\\nargues, Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 11, that \u201cthe Attorney General\u2019s certification that a federal employee was\\n\\nacting within the scope of his employment . . . does not conclusively establish as correct the\\n\\nsubstitution of the United States as defendant in place of the employee.\u201d Council on Am. Islamic\\n\\nRelations v. Ballenger, 444 F.3d 659, 662 (D.C. Cir. 2006). However, such a certification \u201cdoes\\n\\nconstitute prima facie evidence that the employee was acting within the scope of his\\n\\nemployment. A plaintiff challenging [the certification] bears the burden of coming forward with\\n\\nspecific facts\u201d to rebut it. Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff has\\n\\nfailed to present specific facts to rebut the District of Maryland\u2019s ruling, and instead makes\\n\\nunsupported statements about her causes of action. See Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 11. Accordingly, there is\\n\\nno basis to conclude that there are \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d indicating that \u201cthe initial\\n\\ndecision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice,\u201d Christianson, 486 U.S. at\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  11\\n\\x0c817 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court will therefore not disturb the earlier ruling\\n\\nsubstituting the United States in the place of Col. Brazaitis as a defendant in this case.\\n\\n        In part as a consequence of substituting the United States for Col. Brazaitis, the District\\n\\nof Maryland also transferred the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit concerning Walter Reed to this Court. July\\n\\n11, 2011 Memorandum at 3-4, No. 11- 1268, ECF No. 34; July 11, 2011 Order at 1, No. 11-\\n\\n1268, ECF No.35. In doing so, the District of Maryland recognized that the plaintiff bears the\\n\\nburden of showing that her chosen venue is proper. July 11, 2011 Memorandum at 2-3, No. 11-\\n\\n1268, ECF No. 34 (citing Bartholomew v. Va. Chiropractors Ass\u2019n, 612 F.2d 812, 816 (4th Cir.\\n\\n1979), overruled on other grounds by Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pinero, 458 U.S. 119 (1982));\\n\\nsee also Freeman v. Fallin, 254 F. Supp. 2d 52, 56 (D.D.C. 2003). And, as the court noted, suits\\n\\nagainst the United States or agencies thereof are appropriately filed in any jurisdiction in which\\n\\n\u201c(1) a defendant in the action resides, (2) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise\\n\\nto the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated,\\n\\nor (3) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.\u201d July 11, 2011\\n\\nMemorandum at 3, No. 11-1268, ECF No. 34 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a71391(e)).\\n\\n        When deciding to transfer the matter to this Court, the District of Maryland wrote:\\n\\n        Budik has offered no argument in response to the United States\u2019 assertion of\\n        improper venue. In this case, the Complaint indicates that Budik resides in the\\n        District of Columbia. . . . [and] Walter Reed, where the records at issue were\\n        created and stored, is likewise located in the District of Columbia. Colonel\\n        Brazaitis resides in Maryland, but since the United States is the proper\\n        [d]efendant in this case, he is no more than a potential witness.\\n\\nId. at 3. Here, the plaintiff has failed to present to this Court arguments or evidence of\\n\\n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d indicating that the District of Maryland\u2019s \u201cinitial decision\\n\\n[transferring this action] was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d\\n\\n\\n                                                   12\\n\\x0cChristianson, 486 U.S. at 817 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, given the requirements\\n\\nof 28 U.S.C. \u00a71391(e), the Court finds that the District of Columbia is the appropriate venue for\\n\\nthe plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit concerning her Walter Reed records. In any event, because courts should\\n\\nbe \u201cloathe\u201d to \u201crevisit prior decisions of . . . a coordinate court\u201d in the absence of evidence of\\n\\n\u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d id., the Court will not disturb the District of Maryland\u2019s order\\n\\ntransferring the case.\\n\\n       B. The Plaintiff\u2019s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment Claims\\n\\n       The defendants argue first that the plaintiff must bring her claim under the Fifth\\n\\nAmendment alone, and not the Fourteenth, and second that the plaintiff\u2019s claim must be\\n\\ndismissed because she has no cognizable property interest in either her potential for employment\\n\\nor her reputation. Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 9. The plaintiff responds that she had a \u201cgenuine firm offer\u201d\\n\\nfrom Malcolm Grow that was \u201csabotaged by the mishandling of\u201d her performance assessment\\n\\nforms. Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 9.\\n\\n       As an initial matter, the defendants are correct that only the Fifth Amendment applies to\\n\\nthe plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claims in this case. San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. U.S.\\n\\nOlympic Comm., 483 U.S. 522, 542 n.21 (1987) (recognizing that the Fourteenth Amendment\\n\\napplies to state actions, whereas the Fifth Amendment applies to actions by the federal\\n\\ngovernment and its agencies). Accordingly, the Court will treat the plaintiff\u2019s claims as arising\\n\\nsolely under the Fifth Amendment.\\n\\n       In order to state a cause of action for violation of procedural due process under the Fifth\\n\\nAmendment, the plaintiff must show \u201c(1) a deprivation [by the government]; (2) of life, liberty,\\n\\nor property; (3) without due process of law.\u201d Lightfoot v. Dist. of Columbia, 273 F.R.D. 314,\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 13\\n\\x0c319 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing Propert v. Dist. of Columbia, 948 F.2d 1327, 1331 (D.C. Cir. 1991)).\\n\\n\u201c\u2018The first inquiry in every [procedural] due process challenge is whether the plaintiff has been\\n\\ndeprived of a protected interest in \u2018liberty\u2019 or \u2018property.\u2019 Only after finding the deprivation of a\\n\\nprotected interest do[es the Court] look to see if the [government\u2019s] procedures comport with due\\n\\nprocess.\u2019\u201d Gen. Elec. Co. v. Jackson, 610 F.3d 110, 117 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Am. Mfrs.\\n\\nMut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 59 (1999)). The plaintiff alleges that she has been\\n\\ndeprived of property in the form of her \u201copportunity to benefit from gainful employment,\u201d as\\n\\nwell as her \u201creputation in the medical community,\u201d Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 3, and so the Court\\n\\nmust determine whether either of the alleged deprivations constitutes a protected property\\n\\ninterest, see Gen. Elec. Co., 610 F.3d at 117.\\n\\n       The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cinjury to reputation itself [is] not a\\n\\n\u2018liberty\u2019 interest protected\u201d by the Constitution, even where the government\u2019s \u201cstatements . . .\\n\\nwould undoubtedly damage the reputation of one in [the plaintiff\u2019s] position, and impair [her]\\n\\nfuture employment prospects.\u201d Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 233-34 (1991). In Siegert, the\\n\\nplaintiff, a clinical psychologist, agreed to resign from his position at a federal medical facility\\n\\nafter hospital officials indicated that they were preparing to terminate his employment. Id. at\\n\\n227-28. After his resignation, the plaintiff acquired employment at a United States Army\\n\\nhospital in Bremerhaven, West Germany. Id. at 228. In order to receive the appropriate\\n\\ncredentials to practice at the hospital, the plaintiff was required to submit a \u201cCredential\\n\\nInformation Request Form\u201d to his former employer. Id. The plaintiff\u2019s prior supervisor\\n\\nresponded to the request with a letter in which he stated that the plaintiff was \u201cboth inept and\\n\\nunethical, perhaps the least trustworthy individual I have supervised in my thirteen years\u201d at the\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  14\\n\\x0cinstitution from which the plaintiff had resigned. Id. The plaintiff was subsequently denied his\\n\\ncredentials and rejected for a position with another United States Army Hospital in Stuttgart,\\n\\nGermany. Id. Thus, he remained at the hospital in Bremerhaven, where he was given\\n\\nprovisional credentials, which limited him to working only with adults. Id. at 228-29. The\\n\\nplaintiff then filed suit against his previous supervisor, alleging that his \u201cletter had caused him to\\n\\nlose his post as a psychologist at the Bremerhaven Army Hospital, and had rendered him unable\\n\\nto obtain other appropriate employment in the field.\u201d Id. at 229.\\n\\n         As the plaintiff in Siegert, the plaintiff here complains of critical and uncomplimentary\\n\\nremarks made by a supervisor in her performance assessment, and she alleges that her reputation\\n\\nand future job prospects have been damaged as a result of those remarks. Second Am. Compl.\\n\\n\u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 11. However, as the Supreme Court made clear in Siegert, such facts do not provide the\\n\\nbasis for a deprivation of a protected liberty interest. Siegert, 500 U.S. at 233-34. Accordingly,\\n\\nthe plaintiff has failed to state a claim against her prior employer, and the Court must dismiss her\\n\\nFifth Amendment procedural due process claim. 8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n  It is unclear from the plaintiff\u2019s complaint whether she intended to assert a cause of action for procedural or\\nsubstantive due process. Because the facts lend themselves more readily to a procedural due process analysis, the\\nCourt has construed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint as alleging a cause of action for a violation of procedural due process.\\nHowever, even if the Court were to construe the plaintiff\u2019s claim as one for a violation of substantive due process,\\nthe outcome would be the same. This Circuit has stated that \u201c[s]ubstantive due process prevents governmental\\npower from being used for purposes of oppression, or abuse of government power that shocks the conscience, or\\naction that is legally irrational [in that] it is not sufficiently keyed to any legitimate state interests.\u201d Wash. Teachers\u2019\\nUnion Local No. 6 v. Bd. of Educ. of Dist. of Columbia, 109 F.3d 774, 781 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citation and quotations\\nomitted). The conduct complained of in this case hardly constitutes \u201coppression\u201d and cannot be said to \u201cshock the\\nconscience\u201d or be \u201clegally irrational.\u201d See id. at 777-78, 781-82 (finding no violation of substantive due process\\nrights where certain rules allowed school principals \u201cto make subjective, virtually unreviewable decisions\u201d with\\nrespect to their teachers, including ranking the teachers\u2019 performance and selecting which teachers to fire based on\\nthose performance assessments).\\n\\n\\n                                                            15\\n\\x0c       C. The Plaintiff\u2019s Confidentiality of Medical Quality Assurance Records Claim\\n\\n       The defendants move to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s claim of improper disclosure of medical\\n\\nquality assurance records under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102 on two grounds. First, the defendants argue\\n\\nthat, to the extent that the plaintiff seeks monetary damages, the United States has not waived\\n\\nsovereign immunity based on an alleged violation of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102. Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 15-16.\\n\\nThe defendants further argue that \u00a7 1102 designates the records at issue as privileged and\\n\\nexplicitly bars the government from producing those records in this litigation. Id. at 17-19. The\\n\\nplaintiff does not respond to the defendants\u2019 sovereign immunity argument, and asserts in\\n\\nresponse to their privilege argument that an exception in \u00a7 1102 accords this Court the power to\\n\\nreview the records. Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 10-11.\\n\\n       Under \u00a7 1102, \u201c[m]edical quality assurance records created by or for the Department of\\n\\nDefense as part of a medical quality assurance program are confidential and privileged,\u201d and are\\n\\ngenerally protected from disclosure. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(a). The statute in turn defines \u201cmedical\\n\\nquality assurance records\u201d as \u201crecords . . . and reports that emanate from quality assurance\\n\\nprogram activities . . . and are produced or compiled by the Department of Defense as part of a\\n\\nmedical quality assurance program,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(j)(2), and \u201cmedical quality assurance\\n\\nprograms\u201d as \u201cany peer review activity carried out . . . by or for the Department of Defense to\\n\\nassess the quality of medical care, including activities conducted by individuals,\u201d id. \u00a7\\n\\n1102(j)(1). There is no dispute that the records at issue in this case are medical quality assurance\\n\\nrecords emanating from a medical quality assurance program. Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 10-11; Defs.\u2019 Mem.\\n\\nat 17-18.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 16\\n\\x0c        The statute does not waive the United States\u2019s sovereign immunity to suits alleging\\n\\nimproper disclosure of medical quality assurance records, but instead provides for the award of\\n\\nfines for \u201c[a]ny person[\u2019s] . . . willful[] disclos[ure] . . . other than as provided in this section.\u201d\\n\\nId. \u00a7 1102(k) (emphasis added). Nowhere does the statute provide for fines or other relief for\\n\\nany disclosure by the United States.

Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 212 (1983), the Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the\\n\\nplaintiff\u2019s claims for monetary relief under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is therefore\\n\\ndismissed, insofar as it seeks money damages.\\n\\n        The plaintiff, however, seeks more than money damages. Second Am.

As to whether the\\n\\ndefendants\u2019 disclosure of the plaintiff\u2019s performance assessment form was compatible with the\\n\\nuse for which it was collected, the defendants assert, Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 2, 35, and the plaintiff does\\n\\nnot deny, Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 14-15, that the purpose of a DA Form 5374 is to assess the plaintiff\u2019s\\n\\nperformance. And the plaintiff rebuts only in a conclusory fashion the defendants\u2019 contention\\n\\nthat the disclosure of the form was for the purpose of allowing a prospective employer within the\\n\\nsame agency to assess the plaintiff\u2019s performance. Although the plaintiff argues that the\\n\\nperformance assessment was protected from disclosure under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102, Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at\\n\\n\\n                                                21\\n\\x0c10-11, 14-15, this is not the case, as discussed above. The Court thus finds that the disclosure of\\n\\nthe information was compatible with the purpose for which the information was collected,\\n\\nnamely to \u201cmanage credentials and privileges of health care providers in the Military Health\\n\\nSystem.\u201d 65 Fed. Reg. at 4947; see also Radack, 402 F.

Reg. at 4947,\\n\\nand thus the defendants have satisfied the publication requirement of \u00a7 552a(b)(3) of the Privacy\\n\\nAct, see Radack, 402 F. Supp. 2d at 105-06 (finding the publication requirement satisfied where\\n\\nthe government published notice in the Federal Register of \u201cthe categories of individuals covered\\n\\nby the system, the categories of records in the system, the system\u2019s purpose, and the routine uses\\n\\nof records maintained in the system\u201d).\\n\\n       Because the defendants\u2019 disclosure of the information being challenged by the plaintiff\\n\\nfalls within the routine use exception of \u00a7 552a(b)(3), the Court must dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s\\n\\nPrivacy Act claim.\\n\\n       E. The Federal Tort Claims Act\\n\\n       Insofar as the plaintiff has alleged tort claims, Second Am.

Under the FTCA, the United States consents to suit in federal district court for\\n\\ncertain, but not all, tort claims. See, e.g., Richards v. United States, 369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962). The\\n\\nFTCA does not waive sovereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of . . . libel [or] slander,\u201d\\n\\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h), or for constitutional torts, Zakiya v.

Thus, this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff\u2019s claims\\n\\nregardless of whether the plaintiff\u2019s allegations are understood as stating a cause of action for\\n\\ndefamation or for constitutional torts. Accordingly, the Court grants the defendants\u2019 motion to\\n\\ndismiss the plaintiff\u2019s tort claims.\\n\\n         F.

Brazaitis; and a June 5, 2009 letter from the plaintiff to the Army Board,\\n\\nwhich had as attachments a number of additional relevant documents. Id. at 1-4.\\n\\n       The Army Board also considered the requirements outlined in the relevant Army\\n\\nRegulation, Medical Services Clinical Quality Management, Army Reg. 40-68 (2009). First Am.\\n\\nCompl., Attach. 8 (Record of Proceedings) at 4, 6-8. The \u201cregulation establishes policies,\\n\\nprocedures, and responsibilities for the administration of the Army Medical Department . . .\\n\\nClinical Quality Management Program.\u201d Army Reg. 40-68 \u00b6 1-1. In accordance with that\\n\\nregulation, a healthcare provider\u2019s performance is subject to a \u201ccompetency assessment,\u201d\\n\\nwhereby the provider\u2019s \u201c[i]mmediate supervisors . . . are responsible for assessing, maintaining\\n\\nand improving staff competency through an ongoing series of activities.\u201d First Am. Compl.,\\n\\nAttach. 8 (Record of Proceedings) at 7.\\n\\n       The Army Board ultimately denied the plaintiff\u2019s request because \u201cthere is no evidence,\\n\\nand the [plaintiff] . . . provided none, to show that her supervisor did not comply with the\\n\\nregulatory requirements of assessing her in a fair and unbiased manner.\u201d Id. at 9. The Army\\n\\nBoard further found that the plaintiff\u2019s arguments \u201caddress[ed] her dissatisfaction with the\\n\\nassessment and the impact the contested [performance assessment] forms may have had on her\\n\\npotential employment, but fail to show any material error, inaccuracy, or injustice related to the\\n\\nassessments at the time they were rendered.\u201d Id.\\n\\n       The plaintiff twice requested reconsideration of the Army Board\u2019s decision, and each\\n\\ntime, the Army Board reaffirmed its position. Supplemental Attach. to First Am. Compl. at 2-7,\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                27\\n\\x0cNo. 11-1268, ECF No. 49 (October 25, 2011 Army Board for Correction of Military Records,\\n\\nRecord of Proceedings). In doing so, the Army Board relied not only on the evidence before it,\\n\\nbut also on an advisory opinion obtained from the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate at the\\n\\nUnited States Army Medical Command, a component of the Department of the Army.\\n\\nSupplemental Attach. to First Am. Compl. at 8-13, No. 11-1268, ECF No. 49, (April 1, 2011\\n\\nAdvisory Opinion Letter).\\n\\n       Given the Army Board\u2019s thorough consideration of the evidence and the applicable\\n\\nregulations, the plaintiff has failed to show that the \u201cdecision making process was deficient.\u201d\\n\\nKreis, 406 F.3d at 686. Instead, there is a \u201crational connection between the facts found and the\\n\\nchoice made.\u201d Wilhelmus, 796 F. Supp. 2d at 163 (citation and quotation marks omitted). The\\n\\nplaintiff did not allege that her competence assessment or peer review was improperly\\n\\nconducted, and she did not provide evidence to that effect. Rather, the plaintiff\u2019s request for\\n\\ncorrection of her record stemmed from her allegations that \u201cshe was never counseled on staff\\n\\ninteraction that resulted in several complaints,\u201d and that \u201cshe has never been shown\\n\\ndocumentation to substantiate the remarks entered by [Col. Brazaitis]\u201d on the performance\\n\\nassessment form. First Am. Compl., Attach. 8 (Record of Proceedings) at 1-2. She further\\n\\npointed to other evaluations and personnel files that \u201c[made] laudatory remarks\u201d and otherwise\\n\\nconfirmed her competence as a diagnostic radiologist. First Am. Compl., Attach. 8 (Record of\\n\\nProceedings) at 2.\\n\\n       It is not necessarily the case that Col. Brazaitis\u2019s failure to \u201ccounsel[]\u201d the plaintiff or\\n\\n\u201csubstantiate the remarks\u201d with documentation aside from the performance assessment itself, id.,\\n\\nwas indicative of unfair or unbiased treatment warranting the removal of the performance\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  28\\n\\x0cassessment from the plaintiff\u2019s file. Indeed, the Advisory Opinion Letter relied upon by the\\n\\nArmy Board specifically noted that \u201cthere is no requirement [in the Army Regulations] to\\n\\nprovide substantiating evidence with the DA Form 5374.\u201d Supplemental Attach. to First Am.\\n\\nCompl. at 10, No. 11-1268, ECF No. 49 (April 1, 2011 Advisory Opinion Letter). Neither is it\\n\\nnecessarily the case that Col. Brazaitis\u2019s uncomplimentary remarks were the result of some sort\\n\\nof bias against the plaintiff. Performance assessments are not always laudatory. That the Army\\n\\nBoard refused to remove Col. Brazaitis\u2019s remarks in the absence of specific evidence of\\n\\nwrongdoing on his part does not strike the Court as the sort of \u201cegregious decision[]\u201d that should\\n\\nbe overturned. Kreis, 866 F.2d at 1514-15; see Mueller v. Winter, 485 F.3d 1191, 1198 (D.C.\\n\\nCir. 2007) (finding that Board for Correction of Naval Records did not make an arbitrary and\\n\\ncapricious decision in denying the plaintiff\u2019s request to amend his evaluation where the Board\\n\\nwas \u201cunable to find specific information to justify the . . . revision of [the plaintiff\u2019s]\\n\\nevaluation\u201d).\\n\\n        Accordingly, and in keeping with the \u201cunusually deferential application of the \u2018arbitrary\\n\\nor capricious\u2019 standard\u201d owed to the Army Board, Kreis, 866 F.2d at 1514, the Court must\\n\\ndismiss the plaintiff\u2019s 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552(a) claim.\\n\\n        G. The Plaintiff\u2019s Title VII Claim Against the Secretary of the Department of the\\n           Air Force\\n\\n        The defendants argue that the plaintiff\u2019s Title VII claim, which she asserts only against\\n\\nthe Secretary of the Department of the Air Force in relation to her application to work at\\n\\nMalcolm Grow, should be dismissed for failure to allege all of the required elements. Defs.\u2019\\n\\nMem. at 35. The plaintiff responds that she has presented a prima facie case of discrimination.\\n\\nPl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 15-16.\\n\\n\\n                                                  29\\n\\x0c        Under Title VII, it is an \u201cunlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or\\n\\nrefuse to hire . . . any individual . . . because of such individual\u2019s race, color, . . . [or] sex.\u201d 42\\n\\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). A plaintiff makes a prima facie case of Title VII employment\\n\\ndiscrimination where she shows that she (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was qualified\\n\\nfor the position she sought; (3) was rejected despite being qualified for the position; and (4)\\n\\nunder circumstances raising an inference of discrimination, the employer continued to seek out\\n\\nindividuals with qualifications similar to those of the plaintiff to fill the position. McDonnell\\n\\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). Although an employee need not plead a\\n\\nprima facie case of discrimination, she must still allege facts that make her claim more than mere\\n\\nspeculation. Jones v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, 642 F.3d 1100, 1104 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing\\n\\nSwierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 5141 (2002)). In order to state a claim under Title\\n\\nVII, the plaintiff must tie her employer\u2019s refusal to hire her to her membership in a protected\\n\\nclass. See, e.g., Potts v. Howard Univ. Hosp., 258 F. App\u2019x 346, 347 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\u201cBecause\\n\\nracial discrimination in employment is a claim upon which relief may be granted, . . . \u2018I was\\n\\nturned down for a job because of my race\u2019 is all a complaint has to state in order to survive a\\n\\nmotion to dismiss under [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 12(b)(6).\u201d (citation omitted)).\\n\\n        As an African American woman, 2011 Compl., Attach. 2 (March 26, 2010 EEOC Order\\n\\nEntering Judgment) at 4, the plaintiff is a member of at least two protected classes, 42 U.S.C.\\n\\n\u00a7 2000e-2(a), and she asserts that she was not hired as a diagnostic radiologist by Malcolm\\n\\nGrow, 2011 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 39. However, nowhere in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint does she state that\\n\\nshe was not hired because of her membership in a protected class. Rather, the plaintiff alleges\\n\\nthat Malcolm Grow \u201cfailed to hire [her] based on conflicting non-legitimate reasons,\u201d 2011\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                    30\\n\\x0cCompl. \u00b6 39, a reference to the conflicting statements in her performance assessments, id. \u00b6\u00b6 19-\\n\\n22, 24. And the documents attached to the complaint, which the Court may consider, see EEOC\\n\\nv. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624 (D.C. Cir. 1997), also show that she was\\n\\nnot hired by Malcolm Grow because of concerns raised in her performance assessments, e.g.,\\n\\nSupplemental Ex. to Second Am. Compl. at 2, No. 11-cv-1268, ECF No. 62 (April 2, 2009\\n\\nDeclaration of Judith Dawn Colonna) (stating that Malcolm Grow decided not to hire the\\n\\nplaintiff because she \u201clacked independent mammography skills\u201d and her \u201creferences were less\\n\\nthan desirable\u201d).\\n\\n       It is possible to base a non-selection claim on \u201cimproperly low performance rating[s].\u201d\\n\\nSee, e.g., Taylor v. Small, 350 F.3d 1286, 1293 (D.C. Cir. 2003). The plaintiff here, however,\\n\\nhas already pursued amendment of her performance assessment form through the Army Board,\\n\\nand as discussed above, the Court has found that the Army Board did not act in an arbitrary or\\n\\ncapricious manner in finding no basis to require that the form be amended. And, in any event,\\n\\nwhile \u201cTitle VII is violated when an employing organization uses discriminatory evaluations of\\n\\nan employee which were prepared by its own supervisory personnel,\u201d Stoller v. Marsh, 682 F.2d\\n\\n971, 976 (D.C. Cir. 1982), that is not the case here; the performance assessments were completed\\n\\nby supervisory personnel at hospitals other than Malcolm Grow. In particular, they were\\n\\ncompleted by supervisory personnel at Walter Reed, which is part of the Department of the\\n\\nArmy, whereas Malcolm Grow is a part of the Department of the Air Force. While both\\n\\ninstitutions are military hospitals, they are part of separate agencies with separate supervisory\\n\\npersonnel for purposes of employment related issues. See, e.g., Pervez v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, 193\\n\\nF.3d 1371, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (\u201cThe fact that . . . two [military] departments are also part of\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                31\\n\\x0cthe Department of Defense is not inconsistent with their treatment as separate agencies for\\n\\npersonnel purposes.\u201d); Francis v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, 53 M.S.P.R. 545, 549 (1992) (\u201c[T]he\\n\\norganizational history of the Department of Defense indicates that the military service\\n\\ndepartments were intended to function\u2014at least, with respect to personnel matters\u2014with the\\n\\nindependence that generally characterizes executive departments outside the Department of\\n\\nDefense, rather than the limited kind of independence that generally characterizes organizations\\n\\nwithin those departments.\u201d).\\n\\n         The plaintiff refers in her opposition brief to the requirement that she attend a \u201csite visit\u201d\\n\\nat Malcolm Grow, the failure to provide certain documents to her, and the manner in which the\\n\\nperformance assessment forms were transmitted from Landstuhl Regional and Walter Reed to\\n\\nMalcolm Grow as evidence of discrimination. Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 15-17. None of these facts save\\n\\nher Title VII claim.\\n\\n         As to the site visit, the plaintiff alleges that Malcolm Grow \u201clearned of [the p]laintiff\u2019s\\n\\nrace, color, sex, and age\u201d when she attended the site visit at that institution. 2011 Compl. \u00b6 11.\\n\\nShe further contends that such visits were \u201cprohibited,\u201d and that Malcolm Grow normally\\n\\nrequires only telephone interviews during the hiring process. Id. Even if true, it is unclear how\\n\\nrequiring the plaintiff to attend a site visit could have been discriminatory if Malcolm Grow did\\n\\nnot, as the plaintiff states in her complaint, know of her status as a member of a protected class\\n\\nwhen the site visit requirement was imposed, but rather only until after she arrived for the site\\n\\nvisit.\\n\\n         Neither is it clear that Malcolm Grow\u2019s failure to provide the plaintiff with \u201ca copy of the\\n\\nsigned contractual agreement,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 16, was the product of discrimination. The\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                   32\\n\\x0cplaintiff alleges in her complaint that she was not provided with a signed copy of the \u201cAgreement\\n\\nfor Service\u201d as promised in a letter from Sterling Medical. See 2011 Compl. \u00b6 10; id. Attach. 1\\n\\n(August 14, 2008 Letter) at 1. She does not allege, however, that not having the document\\n\\nsomehow prejudiced her during the hiring process, and there is no indication that the failure to\\n\\nprovide the plaintiff with a copy of the document was anything other than the result of lost or\\n\\nmisplaced paperwork. 11\\n\\n         Finally, as to the transmission of the performance evaluations, they were properly\\n\\ndisclosed within the Department of Defense and to hospital officials as permitted by statute and\\n\\nas discussed above.\\n\\n         The plaintiff\u2019s complaint and opposition brief not only fail to connect her membership in\\n\\na protected class with Malcolm Grow\u2019s failure to hire her, but also allege conduct that is neither\\n\\nfacially discriminatory nor lends itself to an inference of discrimination. While the plaintiff\\n\\nmight be correct that the hiring process was somewhat irregular, she has not pled facts\\n\\nsuggesting that she was not hired because of her race, sex, color, or age. Accordingly, the Court\\n\\nmust dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s Title VII claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n  The plaintiff appears to mistake the letter and the contractual agreement for a firm offer of employment.\\nHowever, the letter makes no reference to \u201creserv[ing] the position\u201d for the plaintiff as alleged in the complaint.\\nCompare id. \u00b6 10, with id., Attach. 1 (August 14, 2008 Letter) at 1. Instead, the letter states that the plaintiff was\\nrequired to complete a \u201ccredential packet and background check application.\u201d Id., Attach. 1 (August 14, 2008\\nLetter) at 1. The further requirement indicates that the plaintiff did not receive a firm offer of employment that was\\nsubsequently revoked after Malcolm Grow learned of her race or gender; rather, it indicates only that the application\\nprocess was on-going. It was not until after Malcolm Grow received negative references and poor performance\\nevaluations that the decision was made to not hire the plaintiff. 2011 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-27.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                         33\\n\\x0c                                               IV.

As set forth in his Complaint,\\n\\nMontgomery asserts claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e,\\n\\net seq., and the Age Discrimination of Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 633a, et seq.,\\n\\narguing that PBGC\u2019s failure to select him for the position was discriminatory on the basis of age\\n\\n(58 at the time), gender (male), and race (African American). He also alleges that PBGC\\n\\nunlawfully retaliated against him for engaging in protected activity\u2014lodging prior complaints of\\n\\ndiscrimination against PBGC with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d).\\n1\\n        Montgomery initially named as defendants Hilda L.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), and with the parties\u2019\\nconsent, Joshua Gotbaum, the present Director of the PBGC, was subsequently substituted as the\\ndefendant. (See Dkt.

As Director Gotbaum is named in his official capacity, the Court\\nwill refer to the defendant throughout this opinion as \u201cPBGC\u201d for simplicity\u2019s sake.\\n                                               1\\n\\x0cThis matter is presently before the Court on PBGC\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.

PBGC is funded preliminary through the collection of\\n\\npremiums paid by certain types of pension plans. Id. at \u00a7\u00a7 1306-07. (Dkt. No. 43-1, Joint\\n\\nStatement of Material Facts (\u201cJoint Facts\u201d) at \u00b6 1). 2\\n\\n       On September 14, 2005, PBGC issued vacancy announcement \u201cFODCCD-2005-006,\u201d for\\n\\na GS-510-12\/13 Accountant position within the Collections and Compliance Division of PBGC\u2019s\\n\\nFinancial Operations Department. (Id. at \u00b6 11). The vacancy announcement was posted on the\\n\\nPBGC Online Automated Referral System (\u201cPOLARS\u201d), as well as the Office of Personnel\\n\\nManagement\u2019s USA JOBS website. (Id.). The announcement advised that \u201cit [was] strongly\\n\\nrecommended that applicants submit a complete online application and electronic resume via\\n\\n[POLARS].\u201d (Id.).\\n\\n       Plaintiff DeLarse Montgomery began his employment with PBGC in 1986 as a GS-5\\n\\nsecretary in the Financial Operations Division. (Id. at \u00b6 2). He subsequently progressed within\\n\\nPBGC, ultimately becoming a GS-12 Financial Specialist in the Investment Accounting Branch.\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n        The facts set forth herein are drawn largely from the parties\u2019 \u201cJoint Document of Material\\nFacts\u201d at Docket Entry 43-1, although the Court sometimes cites directly to evidence in the\\nrecord, where appropriate.\\n                                                  2\\n\\x0c(Id. at \u00b6 3).   On October 5, 2005, Montgomery applied for the GS-510-12\/13 Accountant\\n\\nposition, submitting a paper copy of his application to PBGC\u2019s Human Resources Division. (Id.\\n\\nat \u00b6 14). At the time the vacancy announcement was published, PBGC\u2019s Human Resources\\n\\nDepartment used a program called \u201cQuickHire\u201d to determine whether an applicant met the\\n\\nminimum qualifications for the position. (Id. at \u00b6 15). Based on applicants\u2019 responses in the\\n\\nPOLARS electronic system, QuickHire automatically \u201cscreened out\u201d applicants when the\\n\\nsoftware determined that the minimum qualifications for the position were not met, and it\\n\\ngenerated a list of the remaining candidates that did meet the position\u2019s qualifications. (Id.).\\n\\nThe lists were then reviewed by Human Resources Specialists, who generated a roster of\\n\\nminimally-qualified applications for the Subject Matter Expert (\u201cSME\u201d) to review. (Id.).\\n\\n        In this case, after QuickHire conducted an initial screening of the candidates, the list of\\n\\neligible applicants was forwarded to Kenneth Kofsky, the SME for the vacancy, in early\\n\\nNovember 2005. (Id. at \u00b6 16). Mr. Kofsky rated the applicants and they were then placed on\\n\\n\u201cCertificates of Eligibles,\u201d which were forwarded to the sole decisionmaker for the position,\\n\\nRobert Callahan, the Financial Program Manager for the Collections and Compliance Division.\\n\\n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18). Because Montgomery did not submit his application electronically, it appears\\n\\nthat the QuickHire system failed to include his application on the original list of eligible\\n\\napplicants, which meant that his application was not initially provided to Mr. Kofsky for rating,\\n\\nor to Mr. Callahan for consideration. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). Based on the listing he did receive, Mr.\\n\\nCallahan proceeded to interview the candidates and initially selected Kathryn Gillis for the\\n\\nposition, but Ms. Gillis declined the offer. 3 (Id. at \u00b6 18).\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n       Ms. Gillis had a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting, was in the process of\\ncompleting a Master of Science in Accounting, and held a Certified Public Accountant\\ndesignation. (Joint Facts at \u00b6 18).\\n                                                   3\\n\\x0c       After Ms. Gillis turned down the position, PBGC proceeded to compile a second round of\\n\\ncandidates to be considered for the vacancy. During that timeframe, on December 13, 2005,\\n\\nMontgomery contacted Human Resources to inquire about the status of his application. (Id. at \u00b6\\n\\n17). Montgomery was initially informed that his application was not considered because he did\\n\\nnot apply electronically via POLARS. (Id.). Nevertheless, Rick Lattimer, a Human Resources\\n\\nManager, directed Jacqueline Isaac, a Human Resources Specialist, to place Montgomery\u2019s name\\n\\non the second round of certificates to be sent to Mr. Callahan. (Id. at \u00b6 19; Dkt. No. 34-3 at ECF\\n\\npp. 107-113; Dkt. No. 34-10 at 33).\\n\\n       Thereafter, Mr. Callahan contacted Montgomery to schedule an interview, and because\\n\\nMontgomery was on a scheduled leave of absence at the time, Mr. Callahan offered Montgomery\\n\\nthe option of interviewing in person or by telephone. (Joint Facts at \u00b6 21.). Montgomery chose\\n\\nto interview by telephone; he was the only candidate who did not interview in person. (Id.).\\n\\nDuring the interview, Mr. Callahan recognized that Montgomery met the \u201cminimum\u201d\\n\\neducational requirements for the position, but asked if Montgomery had any intention of\\n\\npursuing further education that could be beneficial to the position. (Id.). According to Mr.\\n\\nCallahan, Montgomery replied that he had no interest in pursuing additional education because\\n\\nhe \u201cwas tired.\u201d    (Id.; Dkt. No. 34-13 at \u00b6 3). 4     In addition, although Mr. Callahan had\\n\\nadministered an electronic writing and a Microsoft Excel exercise to the other applicants for the\\n\\nposition, he did not ask Montgomery to complete the exercise due to his poor performance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n       Montgomery argues that this fact is \u201cflatly contradicted\u201d by his deposition testimony,\\nwherein he supposedly stated that he told Mr. Callahan that the reason he could not go back to\\nschool was because the cost of his blood pressure medication was prohibitive, not because he\\n\u201cwas tired.\u201d (See Dkt. No. 37 (\u201cPl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n\u201d) at 9). But regardless of the reason, Montgomery\\ndoes not dispute that he told Mr. Callahan he was not in a position to pursue any further\\neducation.\\n                                                4\\n\\x0cduring the initial portions of the interview. (Joint Facts at \u00b6 21.). According to Mr. Callahan\u2019s\\n\\naffidavit:\\n\\n        [He] formulated the opinion, based on [Montgomery\u2019s] overall performance in the\\n        interview, the qualifications listed on his applications, and his specific posture in\\n        exhibiting no interest in professional growth or improvement, that Mr.\\n        Montgomery was not the best candidate for the position and in fact, made the\\n        least favorable impression among all the candidates.\\n\\n(Dkt. No. 34-13 at \u00b6 4).\\n\\n        Mr. Callahan also interviewed Rhonda Dickerson-Mack for the vacancy. (Joint Facts at \u00b6\\n\\n22). Ms. Mack submitted her application electronically via POLARS, but she initially received a\\n\\nnotification that she did not qualify for the position. (Id.). After she contacted the Human\\n\\nResources Department, PBGC determined that the QuickHire software erroneously \u201cscreened\\n\\nout\u201d Ms. Mack, such that her name was also not included on the initial candidate listings\\n\\nforwarded to Mr. Callahan for consideration.         (Id.).   Upon discovering the issue, PBGC\\n\\nforwarded Ms. Mack\u2019s application to Mr. Callahan for review and consideration. (Id.). Thus,\\n\\nlike Montgomery, Ms. Mack\u2019s application was also submitted to Mr. Callahan for review much\\n\\nlater in the process than some of the other candidates. Ms. Mack possessed an Associate\u2019s\\n\\nDegree in Accounting, was employed by PBGC as an Accountant at the time of her application,\\n\\nand had prior work experience as an Operating Accounting at the GS-510-13 level with the\\n\\nFederal Aviation Administration from 1997 to 2005. (Id.; Dkt. No. 37-24 at 8-11). During his\\n\\ninterview of Ms. Mack, Mr. Callahan administered the writing and Microsoft Excel exercise.\\n\\n(Id. at \u00b6 23). Mr. Callahan ultimately selected Ms. Mack for the position. (Id.). Ms. Mack, like\\n\\nMontgomery, is African American. (Dkt. No. 37-3 at 11-12).\\n\\n        On January 23, 2006, Montgomery was notified that he was not chosen for the\\n\\nAccountant vacancy because \u201c[a]nother candidate was selected.\u201d (Dkt. No. 37-15). On March\\n\\n7, 2006, Montgomery filed a formal complaint of discrimination with the EEOC, and he\\n                                                 5\\n\\x0csubsequently filed the instant lawsuit on July 20, 2010. (Joint Facts at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). Overall,\\n\\nMontgomery has filed a total of four complaints with the EEOC, including the complaint that\\n\\npreceded the instant lawsuit. 5 (Id. at \u00b6 7). Montgomery has since retired from PBGC, electing to\\n\\nparticipate in a voluntary early retirement program effective September 30, 2006. (Id. at \u00b6 3).\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           ANALYSIS\\n\\n    A. Standard of Review\\n\\n       Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates that there is no\\n\\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\\n\\nof law.

To establish a genuine issue of material fact, the\\n\\nnonmoving party must demonstrate\u2014through affidavits or other competent evidence, FED. R.\\n\\nCIV. P. 56(c)(1)\u2014that the quantum of evidence \u201cis such that a reasonable jury could return a\\n\\nverdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d Steele v. Schafer, 535 F.3d 689, 692 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting\\n\\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 248). While the Court views all facts in the light most favorable to the\\n\\nnonmoving party in reaching that determination, Keyes v. District of Columbia, 372 F.3d 434,\\n\\n436 (D.C. Cir. 2004), the nonmoving party must nevertheless provide more than \u201ca scintilla of\\n\\nevidence\u201d in support of its position, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n       At least one of those prior complaints was ultimately litigated in the U.S. District Court\\nfor the District of Columbia. Judge Ricardo Urbina dismissed Montgomery\u2019s claims in that\\ncase\u2014which asserted allegations of gender, race, and age discrimination and of retaliation based\\non his non-selection for an Accountant vacancy at PBGC\u2014on summary judgment. See\\nMontgomery v. Chao, 495 F. Supp. 2d 2 (D.D.C. 2007). That decision was subsequently\\naffirmed by the Court of Appeals in a published opinion. Montgomery v. Chao, 546 F.3d 703,\\n705 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\\n                                                6\\n\\x0c   B. Montgomery\u2019s Discrimination Claims Based On Race, Sex, and Age\\n\\n       Title VII forbids an employer from discriminating against any individual because of race\\n\\nor sex. Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)).\\n\\nUnder McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), Title VII discrimination claims\\n\\nare assessed under a familiar, three-step framework. First, to establish a prima facie case of\\n\\ndiscrimination a plaintiff must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: \u201c(1) [ ]he\\n\\nis a member of a protected class; (2) [ ]he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the\\n\\nunfavorable action gives rise to an inference of discrimination.\u201d Wiley v. Glassman, 511 F.3d\\n\\n151, 155 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Brown v. Brody, 199 F.3d 446, 452 (D.C. Cir. 1999)).\\n\\nSecond, once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to\\n\\narticulate a \u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for the challenged employment action.\\n\\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-04; Wiley, 511 F.3d at 155. Finally, the plaintiff \u201cmust be\\n\\nafforded the opportunity to prove\u201d that the employer\u2019s proffered motive \u201cwas not its true reason,\\n\\nbut was a pretext for discrimination.\u201d Barnette v. Chertoff, 453 F.3d 513, 516 (D.C. Cir. 2006)\\n\\n(quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000)).\\n\\n       The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) makes it unlawful for an employer\\n\\nto terminate or otherwise discriminate against an individual \u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d\\n\\n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). Like claims under Title VII, ADEA claims are evaluated pursuant to the\\n\\nsame three-part, burden-shifting framework outlined above. Barnette, 453 F.3d at 515. As to\\n\\nboth categories of claims, however, the D.C. Circuit has instructed that, once an employer\\n\\nprovides a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for its decision at the summary judgment stage,\\n\\n\u201cthe district court need not\u2014and should not\u2014decide whether the plaintiff actually made out a\\n\\nprima facie case.\u201d Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008)\\n\\n(emphasis in original). Rather, the central question for the Court to resolve is whether \u201cthe\\n                                                7\\n\\x0cemployee produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer\u2019s asserted\\n\\nnon-discriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally\\n\\ndiscriminated against the employee on the basis of race, . . . sex, [and\/or age].\u201d Id.; see also\\n\\nHampton v. Vilsack, 685 F.3d 1096, 1100 (D.C. Cir. 2012). In so doing, the Court must\\n\\nconsider: \u201c(1) the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case; (2) any evidence the plaintiff presents to attack the\\n\\nemployer\u2019s proffered explanations for its actions; and (3) any further evidence of discrimination\\n\\nthat may be available to the plaintiff (such as independent evidence of discriminatory statements\\n\\nor attitudes on the part of the employer) or any contrary evidence that may be available to the\\n\\nemployer (such as evidence of a strong track record in equal opportunity employment).\u201d\\n\\nCzekalski v. Peters, 475 F.3d 360, 363-64 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Aka v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr.,\\n\\n156 F.3d 1284, 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc)). \u201cThis boils down to two inquiries: could a\\n\\nreasonable jury infer that the employer\u2019s given explanation was pretextual, and, if so, could the\\n\\njury infer that this pretext shielded discriminatory motives?\u201d Murray v. Gilmore, 406 F.3d 709,\\n\\n713 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\\n\\n       Here, since the PBGC has advanced a legitimate reason for its decision\u2014that it simply\\n\\nselected a better-qualified candidate for the Accountant position\u2014the Court proceeds directly to\\n\\nthe ultimate question and asks whether Montgomery has adduced sufficient evidence for a\\n\\nreasonable jury to conclude that the PGBC\u2019s proffered reason for its decision is pretextual, and\\n\\nthat its real motivation was discrimination based on Montgomery\u2019s race, sex, and\/or age. The\\n\\nCourt concludes he has not.\\n\\n       To show pretext, a plaintiff may generally offer evidence that similarly-situated\\n\\nemployees outside the protected class were treated \u201cmore favorably in the same factual\\n\\ncircumstances,\u201d or \u201c[a]lternatively, the employee may attempt to demonstrate that the employer\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  8\\n\\x0cis making up or lying about the underlying facts that formed the predicate for the employment\\n\\ndecision.\u201d Brady, 520 F.3d at 495; see also Royall v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO,\\n\\n548 F.3d 137, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Under the latter approach, which Montgomery pursues\\n\\nhere, \u201c[i]f the employer\u2019s stated belief about the underlying facts is reasonable in light of the\\n\\nevidence, however, there ordinarily is no basis for permitting a jury to conclude that the\\n\\nemployer is lying about the underlying facts.\u201d Brady, 520 F.3d at 495. Indeed, this Court does\\n\\nnot sit as a \u201csuper-personnel department\u201d that reexamines an employer\u2019s business decisions.\\n\\nBarbour v. Browner, 181 F.3d 1342, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 1999); see also George v. Levitt, 407 F.3d\\n\\n405, 415 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (\u201c[A]n employer\u2019s action may be justified by a reasonable belief in the\\n\\nvalidity of the reason given even though that reason may turn out to be false.\u201d); Fischbach v.\\n\\nD.C. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 86 F.3d 1180, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (explaining that a court \u201cmay not\\n\\nsecond-guess an employer\u2019s personnel decision absent demonstrably discriminatory motive\u201d).\\n\\n       Montgomery attempts to establish pretext by attacking the legitimacy of PBGC\u2019s\\n\\nexplanation for not selecting him for the Accountant position. He principally argues that Mr.\\n\\nCallahan\u2019s explanations for selecting Ms. Mack (and, in turn, for not selecting Montgomery) are\\n\\n\u201cinconsistent\u201d and have \u201cshifted\u201d over time. (Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 12-16). In turn, he contends that a\\n\\njury could infer from this evidence that Mr. Callahan\u2019s explanations are pretextual and that his\\n\\ntrue motivation was discrimination\u2014whether based on Montgomery\u2019s age, gender, and\/or race.\\n\\nMore specifically, Montgomery points out then when Mr. Callahan initially explained his\\n\\ndecision\u2014in his statement to the EEOC in 2007\u2014he first indicated that the main reason he\\n\\nchose Ms. Mack over Montgomery was that she held a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Accounting, while\\n\\nMontgomery did not. (Id. at 14). In reality, Ms. Mack has an Associate\u2019s Degree in accounting,\\n\\nnot a Bachelor\u2019s Degree. (Joint Facts at \u00b6 22). Second, during his deposition in the EEOC\\n\\n\\n\\n                                               9\\n\\x0cproceedings, Mr. Callahan testified that he found Ms. Mack to be a better candidate because of\\n\\nher experience\u2014she was an accountant and had previous accounting experience, while Mr.\\n\\nMontgomery did not. (Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 14 (citing Dkt. No. 37-19 at 65)). Finally, Montgomery\\n\\npoints to the affidavit submitted by Mr. Callahan in connection with the instant motion, wherein\\n\\nhe attested that he did not select Montgomery due to \u201chis overall performance in the interview . .\\n\\n. and his specific posture in exhibiting no interest in professional growth or improvement.\u201d (Id.\\n\\nat 15 (citing Dkt. No. 34-13)). Pointing to these explanations, Montgomery argues that Mr.\\n\\nCallahan\u2019s \u201cwaffling\u201d between reasons is sufficient evidence of pretext to withstand summary\\n\\njudgment. The Court disagrees.\\n\\n       It is true that a decision-maker\u2019s \u201cshifting and inconsistent\u201d explanations for an adverse\\n\\nemployment action can be probative of pretext. See Geleta v. Gray, 645 F.3d 408, 413 (D.C.\\n\\nCir. 2011) (collecting cases); Czekalski, 475 F.3d at 367. However, the Court does not find Mr.\\n\\nCallahan\u2019s explanations in this case to be \u201cinconsistent.\u201d While it is true that he did not always\\n\\narticulate his decision in precisely the same manner or using precisely the same words, his\\n\\noverarching rationale for choosing Ms. Mack over Montgomery has always remained the same\u2014\\n\\nhe found Ms. Mack to be the better-qualified candidate for the position. Moreover, the key issue\\n\\nis whether Mr. Callahan \u201chonestly and reasonably believed\u201d that Ms. Mack was more qualified\\n\\nfor the position, Brady, 520 F.3d at 496, and Montgomery offers no evidence to undermine the\\n\\nlegitimacy of Mr. Callahan\u2019s belief in this regard.\\n\\n       The Court recognizes that Mr. Callahan may have misremembered the level of Ms.\\n\\nMack\u2019s accounting degree during his first explanation\u2014recounting that she had a Bachelor\u2019s\\n\\nDegree, rather than an Associate\u2019s Degree\u2014but the fact remains that Ms. Mack has a specialized\\n\\ndegree in accounting, while Montgomery does not. Montgomery does not dispute this fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                10\\n\\x0c(Joint Facts at \u00b6 22). Additionally, it bears noting that, in his initial response to the EEOC, Mr.\\n\\nCallahan only stated that the candidates\u2019 educational comparison was \u201cthe biggest difference,\u201d\\n\\nnot the only difference. (Dkt. No. 37-3 at 13). He never contradicted that justification, but he\\n\\nlater elaborated on his rationale during deposition proceedings, explaining that Ms. Mack\u2019s prior\\n\\naccounting experience\u2014as compared to Montgomery\u2019s lack of any accounting experience\u2014\\n\\nmade her a better candidate for the position. 6      Finally, both of those explanations square\\n\\ncompletely with Mr. Callahan\u2019s most recent explanation, and in arguing otherwise, Montgomery\\n\\nomits the critical portion of the complete statement in Mr. Callahan\u2019s affidavit, wherein he stated\\n\\nthat he did not choose Montgomery based on \u201chis overall performance in the interview, the\\n\\n6\\n        Montgomery goes so far as to argue that Mr. Callahan \u201cdisavowed\u201d his earlier\\nexplanation\u2014that Ms. Mack\u2019s education was superior to Montgomery\u2019s\u2014during his deposition.\\n(Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 14). The record does not support this assertion. Rather, the deposition passage\\nMontgomery cites in support of this contention reveals only that his counsel attempted to secure\\nthis concession from Mr. Callahan, but Mr. Callahan did not agree with counsel\u2019s representation\\nand never testified as much:\\n    Q:      Are you able to tell me what it was about Ms. Mack that made you think that\\n    she\u2019s a better candidate than Mr. Montgomery? It wasn\u2019t education. Right?\\n    A:      She had better experience. She was - - she had worked at the GS-13 level for a\\n    number of years. She was an accountant. Mr. Montgomery was - - had never been an\\n    accountant.\\n    Q:      But he was qualified to be an accountant, though, wasn\u2019t he? Or he wouldn\u2019t\\n    have been on the list.\\n    A:      True. But I had to choose the best candidate, and I chose the one that had\\n    accounting experience over the one that didn\u2019t, had a lot of accounting experience and at\\n    a higher grade level.\\n(Dkt. No. 37-19 at 65). While Mr. Callahan focused his response on Ms. Mack\u2019s experience,\\nrather than her education, he did not \u201cdisavow,\u201d as Montgomery suggests, that her education\\nplayed no role in his decision.\\n      Montgomery argues that Mr. Callahan also contradicted himself by testifying, at pages 61\\nand 63 of his deposition transcript, that he believed both Montgomery and Ms. Mack \u201cmet the\\nminimum [educational] qualification.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 14-15). But the excerpts Montgomery\\nsubmitted from Mr. Callahan\u2019s deposition at Docket No. 37-19 do not include pages 61 or 63.\\n(See Dkt. No. 37-19 (comprised of transcript pages 1, 65-66, 68, 80, 87)). Accordingly, no such\\ntestimony or evidence is before the Court. But even if the Court were to take that supposed\\ntestimony into account, the fact that Mr. Callahan testified that both candidates met the minimum\\neducational qualifications certainly does contradict the explanation that he found Montgomery\u2019s\\nqualifications\u2014though minimally sufficient\u2014to be less impressive than Ms. Mack\u2019s.\\n                                                11\\n\\x0cqualifications listed on his application, and his specific posture in exhibiting no interest in\\n\\nprofessional growth or improvement.\u201d (Dkt. No. 34-13 at \u00b6 4) (emphasis added). Of course, the\\n\\n\u201cqualifications listed on [Montgomery\u2019s] application\u201d\u2014an aspect of Mr. Callahan\u2019s decision that\\n\\nMontgomery conveniently omitted with opportunely-placed ellipses, (Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 15)\u2014\\n\\nundoubtedly encompassed Montgomery\u2019s education and professional background, as compared\\n\\nto Ms. Mack.      Therefore, the Court finds Montgomery\u2019s argument that Mr. Callahan\u2019s\\n\\nexplanations are \u201cshifting\u201d or \u201cinconsistent\u201d to be unpersuasive. In addition, to the extent that\\n\\nMr. Callahan\u2019s explanations could arguably be characterized as \u201cinconsistent,\u201d the Court\\n\\nbelieves that any such inconsistencies are \u201cso minor that no reasonable jury could find that\\n\\n[PBGC\u2019s] proffered reasons are a pretext for discrimination.\u201d Butler v. Sebelius, Case No. 12-\\n\\n5042, 2012 WL 2372867, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 12485 (D.C. Cir. June 19, 2012); Dominguez-\\n\\nCruz v.

Gray, 842 F.\\n\\nSupp. 2d 13, 24 (D.D.C. 2012) (observing that \u201c[t]his logic applies when an employer\u2019s reason\\n\\nfor allegedly discriminatory actions changes in a material way throughout the stages of\\n\\nlitigation\u201d) (emphasis added).\\n\\n       Montgomery also argues that Mr. Callahan\u2019s explanation is pretextual because he\\n\\nconducted Montgomery\u2019s interview differently from all of the other candidates\u2014deciding not to\\n\\nadminister the writing and Microsoft Excel exercises during the interview. He argues that, based\\n\\non this distinction, a jury could infer that Mr. Callahan \u201chad made up his mind not to select\\n\\n[Montgomery] even before the interview.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 16). But Mr. Callahan offered an\\n\\nexplanation for this discrepancy\u2014he did not administer the exercises because Montgomery\\n\\n\\n\\n                                               12\\n\\x0c\u201cmade the least favorable impression among all the candidates\u201d during his interview.

Furthermore, although Mr. Callahan testified that he already had a \u201cpretty good\\n\\nidea who [he] wanted to select\u201d by the time he interviewed Montgomery, \u201cevidence of pre-\\n\\nselection is relevant only insofar as it logically supports an inference of discriminatory intent.\u201d\\n\\nKolstad v. Am. Dental Ass\u2019n, 139 F.3d 958, 969 (D.C. Cir. 1998), vacated on other grounds by\\n\\n527 U.S. 526 (1999); Oliver-Simon v. Nicholson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 298, 310 (D.D.C. 2005)\\n\\n(\u201c[P]laintiff's pre-selection claim does not advance h[is] case for pretext unless [he] produces\\n\\nsome evidence that discrimination played a role in [the selectee\u2019s] pre-selection and thus\\n\\nplaintiff\u2019s non-selection.\u201d). Even if Mr. Callahan were already leaning toward selecting Ms.\\n\\nMack for the position at the time he interviewed Montgomery, Montgomery fails to point to any\\n\\nevidence suggesting that any such pre-selection was motivated by a discriminatory animus\\n\\ntowards Montgomery, whether due to his age, his gender, or his race. If anything, the record\\n\\nstrongly suggests the opposite\u2014that Mr. Callahan was leaning toward Ms. Mack because she\\n\\nwas a strongly-qualified candidate for the position.\\n\\n        Finally, the Court notes that Montgomery can also attempt to \u201cavoid summary judgment\\n\\nby presenting other evidence, direct or circumstantial, that permits an inference of\\n\\ndiscrimination,\u201d such as \u201cdiscriminatory statements,\u201d \u201cother attitudes suggesting the decision\\n\\nmaker harbors discriminatory animus,\u201d and\/or other \u201cdata\u201d concerning his protected class(es).\\n\\nHolcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 899 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted).            But\\n\\nMontgomery presents no such evidence. Most notably, the Court observes that Montgomery\\n\\nexpressly does not argue that he actually was more qualified for the Accountant position than\\n\\nMs. Mack. (See Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 15-16) (\u201c[W]hether Ms. Mack was more qualified . . . is not the\\n\\ncritical issue in this case.\u201d).   Instead, he has sought to establish pretext by \u201cexpos[ing] other\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 13\\n\\x0cflaws in the employer\u2019s explanation,\u201d Aka, 156 F.3d at 1295\u2014namely, that the reasoning\\n\\nunderlying Mr. Callahan\u2019s decision has changed over time and that the veracity of that reasoning\\n\\nshould not be credited as a result. The Court rejects that argument for the reasons stated. And\\n\\nthe fact that Montgomery does not even attempt to argue that he was better qualified\u2014let alone\\n\\n\u201csignificantly better qualified,\u201d id. at 1294\u2014simply adds to the void of evidence suggesting that\\n\\nPBGC\u2019s decision was discriminatory. Indeed, the undisputed record before the Court amply\\n\\nsupports the opposite conclusion\u2014that Ms. Mack was demonstrably and objectively more\\n\\nqualified for the position than Montgomery.            Ms. Mack holds an Associate\u2019s Degree in\\n\\naccounting, while Montgomery does not have any accounting degree. (Joint Facts at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 22).\\n\\nIn addition, Ms. Mack had nearly a decade of accounting experience working for the federal\\n\\ngovernment, whereas Montgomery had never been employed as an accountant and had no\\n\\naccounting experience.      (Id.).   These facts further undermine Montgomery\u2019s assertion that\\n\\nPBGC\u2019s motive was discriminatory. Hamilton v. Geithner, 666 F.3d 1344, 1352 (D.C. Cir.\\n\\n2012) (\u201c[A] disparity in qualifications, standing alone, can support an inference of discrimination\\n\\nonly when the qualifications gap is \u2018great enough to be inherently indicative of discrimination\u2019\u2014\\n\\nthat is, when the plaintiff is \u2018markedly more qualified,\u2019 \u2018substantially more qualified,\u2019 or\\n\\n\u2018significantly better qualified\u2019 than the successful candidate.\u201d) (internal citations omitted). 7\\n\\n       Therefore, the Court concludes that Montgomery fails to raise a genuine issue of material\\n\\nfact with respect to his age, gender, or race discrimination claims. No reasonable jury could find\\n\\ndiscrimination under these circumstances, even when viewing the evidence in the light most\\n\\nfavorable to Montgomery. Even if the Court were to find that Montgomery created a \u201cweak\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n       As our Circuit has explained, this principle is grounded in the idea that a reasonable\\nemployer would usually not select a less-qualified candidate \u201cunless some other strong\\nconsideration, such as discrimination, enters into the picture.\u201d Aka, 156 F.3d at 1294.\\n                                                  14\\n\\x0cissue of fact\u201d as to pretext, the uncontroverted evidence of Ms. Mack\u2019s superior qualifications\\n\\nand experience constitutes \u201cindependent evidence that no discrimination . . . occurred.\u201d Reeves,\\n\\n530 U.S. at 148 (citing Aka, 156 F.3d at 1291-92). 8 The Court grants summary judgment on\\n\\nthese claims in favor of PBGC.\\n\\n\\n\\n    C. Montgomery\u2019s Retaliation Claim\\n\\n       Title VII also prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee \u201c\u2018because he\\n\\nhas opposed any practice\u2019 made unlawful by Title VII or \u2018has made a charge, testified, assisted,\\n\\nor participated\u2019 in a Title VII investigation or proceeding.\u201d Steele, 535 F.3d at 695 (quoting 42\\n\\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a)). Retaliation claims under Title VII are also subject to the three-part\\n\\nburden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas. Thus, a plaintiff must first establish a prima\\n\\nfacie case of retaliation by showing: \u201c(1) that he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) that\\n\\nhe suffered a materially adverse action by his employer; and (3) that a causal link connects the\\n\\ntwo.\u201d Jones v. Bernanke, 557 F.3d 670, 677 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citing Wiley, 511 F.3d at 155).\\n\\nThereafter, if the plaintiff is able to satisfy the requirements of a prima facie case, the burden\\n\\nshifts back to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its actions. Id.\\n\\nOnce the employer does so, the burden-shifting framework disappears, and \u201ca court reviewing\\n\\nsummary judgment looks to whether a reasonable jury could infer retaliation from all the\\n\\nevidence, which includes not only the prima facie case, but also the evidence the plaintiff offers\\n\\nto attack the employer\u2019s proffered explanation for its action and other evidence of retaliation.\u201d\\n8\\n       Furthermore, Montgomery\u2019s race discrimination claim is particularly undercut by the fact\\nthat Ms. Mack is also African American. See, e.g., Murray v. Gilmore, 406 F.3d 708, 715 (D.C.\\nCir. 2005) (\u201c[A] replacement within the same protected class cuts strongly against any inference\\nof discrimination.\u201d). And while Ms. Mack, as a younger, female employee, falls outside\\nMontgomery\u2019s protected class with respect to his age and gender discrimination claims, this fact,\\nwithout more, is woefully insufficient to raise an inference of discrimination, particularly given\\nthe Court\u2019s earlier analysis herein.\\n                                                 15\\n\\x0cGeleta, 645 F.3d at 411; see also Carter v. George Washington Univ., 387 F.3d 872, 878 (D.C.\\n\\nCir. 2004).\\n\\n       Here, even assuming that Montgomery can establish a prima facie case, he fails to adduce\\n\\nsufficient evidence to suggest that PBGC\u2019s legitimate justification for his non-selection\u2014i.e.,\\n\\nthat Ms. Mack was simply more qualified\u2014is pretextual. 9 First, to the extent that he attacks Mr.\\n\\nCallahan\u2019s explanation as \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cshifting,\u201d the Court rejects that argument for the reasons\\n\\nalready stated. Alternatively, Montgomery argues that the PBGC\u2019s delay in submitting his\\n\\napplication to Mr. Callahan amounts to evidence of pretext and a retaliatory motive. (Pl.\u2019s\\n\\nOpp\u2019n at 17-18). Specifically, he argues that Ms. Isaac\u2019s involvement with his application\\n\\nimbued the process with retaliatory animus, given her knowledge of Montgomery\u2019s prior EEO\\n\\ncase and her stated belief that promotions should be based on experience, not settlement\\n\\nagreements. (Id.). He also argues that Ms. Isaac was substantially involved in determining\\n\\ncandidates\u2019 minimum qualifications for the position and purposefully delayed his inclusion on\\n\\nthe list of candidates submitted to the selecting official. (Joint Facts at \u00b6 20). PBGC disputes\\n\\nthis proposition and maintains that Ms. Isaac\u2019s only involvement with Montgomery\u2019s application\\n\\nwas to affirmatively place him on the candidate listing that was submitted to Mr. Callahan for\\n\\nreview. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20). This dispute is immaterial, however, because even assuming Ms. Isaac\\n\\nwere more substantively involved in the process, the Court finds Montgomery\u2019s argument\\n\\nunpersuasive for several reasons. First, while Montgomery\u2019s application was delayed somewhat,\\n\\nso too was Ms. Mack\u2019s, and she was ultimately selected for the position nevertheless. (Joint\\n\\nFacts at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23). Insofar as the selectee encountered similar procedural setbacks and delay,\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n       In view of this conclusion, the Court need not reach PBGC\u2019s argument that Montgomery\\nis unable establish a prima facie case of retaliation because Mr. Callahan was arguably unaware\\nof any of Montgomery\u2019s prior EEO activity.\\n                                               16\\n\\x0cthis fact strongly cuts against Montgomery\u2019s pretext argument.                         Second, Montgomery\u2019s\\n\\nargument is refuted by his own testimony, wherein he confirmed that he does not believe the\\n\\ndelay in his application process was discriminatory or retaliatory:\\n\\n       Q: So do you contend that the delay in sending your application up\\n       discriminated against you based on your race, color, sex, age or for reprisal?\\n       A: I did not make that allegation.\\n       Q: And the selectee was selected from applications that came up late; is that\\n       correct?\\n       A: That\u2019s correct.\\n\\n(Dkt. No. 42-1 at ECF p. 2). The Court thus finds that Montgomery failed to raise a genuine\\n\\nissue of material fact to suggest that PBGC\u2019s proffered explanation for its decision is pretextual,\\n\\nnor does he otherwise present evidence sufficient to raise an inference of retaliation. In turn, the\\n\\nCourt grants summary judgment in favor of PBGC on Montgomery\u2019s retaliation claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         CONCLUSION\\n\\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that PBGC\u2019s Motion for Summary\\n\\nJudgment must be GRANTED.

Grandmaison now appeals the eighteen-month sentence of imprisonment he received, contending that the district court failed to depart downward from the minimum prison term mandated by the Sentencing Guidelines (\"Guidelines\") because of the erroneous view that it lacked authority to do so.   We agree that the district court misapprehended its authority to depart downward on aberrant behavior grounds.   See Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual Ch. 1, Pt. A, Introduction p 4(d) (1994).   Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand to the district court for a determination of whether a downward departure on the basis of aberrant behavior is warranted in this case.   Jurisdiction stems from 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742.\\n    \\n    I. THE FACTS\\n    \\n      2\\n      We consider the facts as set forth in the unobjected-to portions of the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\"), the information to which defendant pled guilty, and the sentencing hearing transcript.   See, e.g., United States v. LeBlanc, 24 F.3d 340, 342 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S. Ct. 250, 130 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1994);  United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 52 (1st Cir.1993).   Grandmaison served as an \"at-large\" member on the Nashua Board of Alderman (\"Board\") from 1986 to 1993.   The Board consists of fifteen members--six of whom are elected at-large and nine of whom are elected from one of Nashua\\'s nine electoral wards--and functions as Nashua\\'s chief legislative arm, enacting municipal legislation and approving all financing and municipal construction projects.   Grandmaison served on the Board\\'s Secondary School Coordinating Committee (\"SSCC\") and the Joint Special School Building Committee (\"JSSBC\").\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Like many of his aldermanic colleagues, Grandmaison also had a full-time job.   He was employed as Marketing Director of the Eckman Construction Company (\"Eckman Construction\"), a Bedford, New Hampshire-based company, from 1989 to 1993.   In addition to his job as Eckman Construction\\'s Marketing Director, Grandmaison participated in a number of charitable activities.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      In 1990, the Board began seeking construction bids for a $6.3 million project, the renovation of Nashua\\'s sixty-year old Elm Street Junior High School.   Both the SSCC and the JSSBC, the two committees on which Grandmaison served, play integral roles in selecting a school construction contractor and in overseeing the construction process.   The SSCC, inter alia, preselects school construction contractors, oversees school construction or renovation work, and makes recommendations concerning contractor expenditures and payments.   The JSSBC, which is comprised of both alderman and Nashua School Board members, reviews the SSCC\\'s recommendations regarding contractors, payments, and contract modifications.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Eckman Construction submitted a bid for the lucrative Elm Street School Project contract.   In spite of the conflict in interest, Grandmaison remained on both the SSCC and the JSSBC for months after Eckman Construction submitted its bid.   He publicly recused himself from both committees on January 9, 1991, but only after questions were raised about his connections to Eckman Construction.   The subcommittee vacancies created by Grandmaison\\'s departures were filled by Alderman Thomas Magee (\"Magee\"), an at-large member of the Board and purported construction aficionado.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      After recusal from the SSCC and JSSBC, Grandmaison continued as an at-large member of the Board.   He also secretly took steps to manipulate the contacts he enjoyed as an alderman to Eckman Construction\\'s advantage.   From February 1991 until shortly before the Elm Street Project was completed, Grandmaison lobbied three of his aldermanic colleagues--Magee, Steve Kuchinski (\"Kuchinski\"), and Anne Ackerman (\"Ackerman\"), SSCC chairperson--on Eckman Construction\\'s behalf.   Grandmaison distributed informational materials and video cassettes about Eckman construction to both Ackerman and Magee.   At the behest of Hal Eckman (\"Eckman\"), president of Eckman Construction, Grandmaison gave gratuities, gifts, and other things of value to Kuchinski, Magee, and Ackerman before and after major contract selection votes.   These gratuities and gift items included pay-per-view sporting events, dinners, money, campaign contributions, and promises of future political support.   Grandmaison also extended Ackerman a personal loan and steered Eckman Construction printing jobs to the printing business she owned.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      These lobbying efforts eventually bore fruit.   In June 1991, the Board awarded the Elm Street Project contract to Eckman Construction by a vote of eight to seven, with Kuchinski casting the tie-breaking vote.   The project contract, which the Board subsequently mailed to Eckman Construction, served as the basis for the charges brought against Grandmaison.   The government charged Grandmaison with violating 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1346, the mail fraud statute.   Specifically, it maintained that Grandmaison utilized the mail system to forward a fraudulent scheme in violation of the oath of honest, faithful, and impartial service he took before becoming an alderman and a host of state and local laws pertaining, inter alia, to conflicts of interest, influencing discretionary decisions by public servants, and acceptance of pecuniary benefits by public officials.   See New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated 640 et seq.  (1986 &amp; Supp.1994);  Nashua, N.H., Rev. Ordinances &#167;&#167; 2-273, 2-274, 2-276, 2-278;  and Nashua, N.H., Rev. Ordinances &#167;&#167; 7:56, 7:59.   The government also prosecuted Magee and Kuchinski for their roles in this case.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Pursuant to a plea agreement with the government, Grandmaison pled guilty to a one count information charging him with utilizing the mail system to defraud Nashua citizens of their right to the honest services of their public officials.   The district court scheduled a sentencing hearing and prior thereto received a PSR from the Probation Department.   The PSR prepared by the Probation Department recommended a total adjusted guideline offense level of fifteen.   This recommendation reflects an eight level increase in the base offense because a public official in a decision making position committed the crime and a three level decrease for acceptance of responsibility.   See U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2C1.7(b)(1)(B), 3E1.1(a) and (b).   Because Grandmaison had no prior criminal record, the Probation Department placed him in Criminal History Category I, resulting in a sentencing range of eighteen to twenty-four months.\\n    \\n    II. THE SENTENCING HEARING\\n    \\n      9\\n      At the sentencing hearing, Grandmaison requested a downward departure to an offense level of eight, which corresponds to a sentencing range of zero to six months.   Grandmaison based this request on three interrelated grounds:  1) his criminal conduct constituted \"aberrant behavior\" within the meaning of Guidelines Manual Ch. 1, Pt. A, Introduction p 4(d);  2) his extraordinary contributions to family, friends, and the community were not adequately addressed by the Guidelines;  and 3) the facts of his case warranted a downward departure by analogy to section 2C1.3 of the Guidelines.   The defense also submitted one hundred letters attesting to Grandmaison\\'s good deeds and character at the sentencing hearing.   Based on these letters and Grandmaison\\'s prior record, the government agreed that downward departure on aberrant behavior grounds was appropriate and recommended a reduced prison sentence of twelve months and one day.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      The district court declined to depart downward on any of the three grounds advanced by Grandmaison.   The court, citing our decision in United States v. Catucci, 55 F.3d 15, 19 n. 3 (1st Cir.1995), as support, found that a \"downward departure based on \\'aberrant behavior,\\' \" though generally available under the Guidelines, \"was not available as a matter of law\" in this case.   It concluded that Grandmaison\\'s conduct did not fall within the definition of aberrant behavior.   The definition adopted by the court required a showing of first-offender status, behavior inconsistent with otherwise good or exemplary character, and spontaneity or thoughtlessness in committing the crime of conviction.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Next, the court concluded that the facts did not warrant downward departure on the basis of Grandmaison\\'s contribution to family, friends, and the community.   It did not make a specific finding on the section 2C1.3 claim raised by Grandmaison, but did state that \"no other grounds ... advanced [by defendant or the government] ... would justify departure downward.\"   Accordingly, the court adopted the PSR\\'s factual findings and offense calculations in full.   Honoring the government\\'s request for leniency, the court selected the lowest end of the applicable guideline range and sentenced Grandmaison to an eighteen month term of imprisonment and two years of supervised release.   The court also assessed Grandmaison $50.00, as required by statute.\\n    \\n    III. REFUSALS TO DEPART FROM THE GUIDELINES\\n    \\n      12\\n      Before addressing the three grounds on which defendant rests his appeal, we briefly discuss the rules pertaining to refusals to depart from sentences prescribed by the Guidelines.   Under the Sentencing Reform Act, sentencing courts are expected to apply the Guidelines, adjust the base offense level as the facts require, calculate a sentencing range, and impose a sentence within the identified range.  United States v. Jackson, 30 F.3d 199, 201 (1st Cir.1994);  see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b);  Guidelines Manual Ch. 1, Pt. A, Introduction p 4(b).   In general, sentencing courts are to regard \"each guideline as carving out a \\'heartland,\\' a set of typical cases embodying the conduct each guideline describes.\"   Guidelines Manual Ch. 1, Pt. A, Introduction comment 4(b).   Departures are warranted only where a case is atypical or where the facts are significantly outside the norm.  Jackson, 30 F.3d at 201.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Decisions to depart generally fall into one of three categories:  forbidden, discouraged, and encouraged.   Forbidden departures are those based, inter alia, on race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, or socioeconomic status.   See Jackson, 30 F.3d at 202;  United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 948-49 (1st Cir.1993);  U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5H1.10, 5H1.12.   The Sentencing Commission (\"Commission\") has expressly precluded departure on these grounds, even where they make a case atypical or extraordinary.  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948-49.   Discouraged departures involve factors which were considered by the Commission--such as age, family ties and responsibilities, employment record, good works, or physical condition--but which present themselves to an extraordinary degree in a particular case.  United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1323-24 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S. Ct. 947, 130 L. Ed. 2d 890 (1995);  United States v. Hilton, 946 F.2d 955, 959 (1st Cir.1991).   Encouraged departures, in contrast, involve considerations not previously taken into account by the Commission.  Hilton, 946 F.2d at 959.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Because the Commission intended departures on any grounds to be the exception rather than the rule, Jackson, 30 F.3d at 201, a district court\\'s refusal to depart--upward or downward--is ordinarily not appealable.   See United States v. DeCosta, 37 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Gaines, 7 F.3d 101, 105 (7th Cir.1993);  Hilton, 946 F.2d at 957.   The well-established rule is that appellate courts lack jurisdiction to review discretionary district court decisions not to depart from sentences imposed under the Guidelines.   See United States v. Byrd, 53 F.3d 144, 145 (6th Cir.1995);  United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 473 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 292 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 878, 113 S. Ct. 224, 121 L. Ed. 2d 161 (1992).\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      There are, however, certain exceptions to this rule.   Appellate jurisdiction attaches, for example, where the record indicates that the trial court\\'s failure to depart was the product of a mistake of law.  Gifford, 17 F.3d at 473;  Amparo, 961 F.2d at 292;  Hilton, 946 F.2d at 957.   If it appears that a misapprehension of the applicable guideline or miscalculation of the authority to deviate from the guideline range prevented the court from departing downward, appellate review is appropriate.  Gifford, 17 F.3d at 473;  United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S. Ct. 919, 130 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1995).\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Our review as to whether such a misapprehension of judicial authority occurred is plenary.  United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 221 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S. Ct. 1322, 131 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1995).   Plenary review also governs where the issue on appeal pertains to the scope or interpretation of a guideline.  United States v. Marcello, 13 F.3d 752, 755 (3d Cir.1994) (\"The question of whether the district court adopted the proper standard [of interpretation] is a question of law subject to plenary review.\").\\n    \\n    IV. DISCUSSION\\n    \\n      17\\n      The crux of Grandmaison\\'s appeal is that the district court misunderstood the scope of its departure authority.   He argues that the court erroneously concluded that it was precluded from departing downward on the grounds of aberrant behavior and extraordinary offender characteristics.   Additionally, he maintains that the court misapprehended its power to depart downward by analogy to section 2C1.3 of the Guidelines, which concerns conflicts of interest.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2C1.3.   We begin by analyzing the claim that the facts of this case permit downward departure on the basis of aberrant behavior and discuss the two remaining bases for appeal in turn.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      A. Aberrant Behavior as a Basis for Downward Departure.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      1. Jurisdiction and the District Court\\'s Refusal to Depart.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      The threshold issue raised by defendant\\'s aberrant behavior claim is whether we have jurisdiction to review the district court\\'s refusal to depart downward.  Pierro, 32 F.3d at 619.   We note at the outset, though it does not relate directly to questions of jurisdiction, that the basic premise of defendant\\'s aberrant departure claim is correct.   The Guidelines permit downward departures on the basis of aberrant behavior.   See, e.g., Catucci, 55 F.3d at 19 n. 3 (citing cases);  Marcello, 13 F.3d at 760 (citing cases);  Gifford, 17 F.3d at 475;  United States v. Morales, 972 F.2d 1007, 1011 (9th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 1012, 113 S. Ct. 1665, 123 L. Ed. 2d 283 (1993).   Such departures fall into the category embracing factors not previously considered by the Commission.  United States v. Premachandra, 32 F.3d 346, 349 (8th Cir.1994);  United States v. Fairless, 975 F.2d 664, 668-69 (9th Cir.1992);  see Guidelines Manual Ch. 1, Pt. A, Introduction p 4(d) (\"The Commission, of course, has not dealt with the single acts of aberrant behavior that still may justify probation at higher offense levels through departures.\").   And they may be employed whether the sentence computed involves imprisonment or merely probation.   See United States v. Duerson, 25 F.3d 376, 380 (6th Cir.1994) (citing cases);  Fairless, 975 F.2d at 668.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      Consistent with the departure recommendation it entered at sentencing, the government acknowledges that aberrant behavior departures are available under the Guidelines, but maintains that we lack jurisdiction to review defendant\\'s claim because the district court\\'s refusal to depart was an exercise of discretion.   Defendant disputes this, arguing that he has cleared his jurisdictional hurdle because the record clearly shows that the district court\\'s refusal to depart stemmed from a misapprehension of its authority to depart on aberrant behavior grounds.   See Gifford, 17 F.3d at 473;  Pierro, 32 F.3d at 611.   Having reviewed the totality of the record, as we are obligated to do, see United States v. Morrison, 46 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir.1995) (citing United States v. LeBlanc, 24 F.3d 340, 348 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S. Ct. 250, 130 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1994)), we find that the truth lies somewhere between these two positions.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      The record reveals that the district court understood its general authority to depart on aberrant behavior grounds, but adopted the wrong standard in determining whether defendant\\'s behavior was \"aberrant\" under the Guidelines.   The court erroneously held that an aberrant behavior departure in this Circuit requires an initial finding of \"spontaneity\" or a \"thoughtless act.\"   Anticipating our review, the court also made it clear that it would have granted the departure requests entered by both defendant and the government had it not believed itself bound to this standard:\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      THE COURT:  And so I\\'m going to sentence you at the lowest end of the guidelines range that otherwise is applicable in your case.   If the Court of Appeals disagrees with my interpretation of aberrant behavior and the case is returned, if it helps the Court of Appeals in terms of imposing sentence on appeal or resolving the question on appeal, assuming you do appeal, I will say on the record that if I thought I could depart on a principled basis and consistent with the law, I would follow the U.S. Attorney\\'s recommendation and I would sentence you to one year--12 months and one day.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      Based on this statement, we think it plain that the court misunderstood its authority to depart downward under the law of this Circuit.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      We therefore agree with defendant on this initial matter of jurisdiction.   The district court\\'s misapprehension of its departure authority confers jurisdiction on this court.   See Gifford, 17 F.3d at 473;  Pierro, 32 F.3d at 619.   The de novo standard of review governs our review of this aspect of defendant\\'s claim.   See Marcello, 13 F.3d at 755.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      2. A Definition of Aberrant Behavior.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      The Guidelines refer to \"single acts of aberrant behavior,\" but neither define that phrase nor provide any insight into what the Commission might have meant when it used it.   See Guidelines Manual Ch. 1, Pt. A, Introduction p 4(d);  United States v. Williams, 974 F.2d 25, 26 (5th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 934, 113 S. Ct. 1320, 122 L. Ed. 2d 706 (1993).   Defendant\\'s claim presents an issue of first impression in this Circuit.   We have considered cases involving departure requests based on aberrant behavior, see, e.g., Catucci, 55 F.3d at 19 n. 3;  United States v. Pozzy, 902 F.2d 133, 137-38 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 943, 111 S. Ct. 353, 112 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1990);  United States v. Russell, 870 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1989), but have not had occasion to define that term with specificity until now.  Catucci, supra, which the district court erroneously regarded as foreclosing departure, did not require us to define \"aberrant behavior.\"   In that case, we acknowledged disagreement among the circuits as to what type of conduct aberrant behavior entails but did not deem it necessary to articulate a definition for our own Circuit because we found that the defendant had waived his departure claim.   Grandmaison\\'s claim, in contrast, hinges on an articulation of an aberrant behavior standard.   We, therefore, turn our attention to that task.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      Two cases establish what have come to be recognized as the outer boundaries of the aberrant behavior spectrum.  United States v. Russell, 870 F.2d 18 (1st Cir.1989), stands at one end of the spectrum and United States v. Carey, 895 F.2d 318 (7th Cir.1990), at the other.  Russell involved criminal conduct which was impulsive and unpremeditated.   Tempted by the prospect of instant wealth, a Wells Fargo armored truck driver and his partner decided to keep an extra bag of money mistakenly handed them.   The driver, who had no prior criminal record, returned the money almost immediately after committing his crime and cooperated in the subsequent police investigation.   In contrast, Carey involved a premeditated criminal scheme carried out over a long period of time.   There, a trucking company president engaged in a check-kiting scheme over a fifteen-month period.   Each work day during this period the company president concealed his two over-drawn bank accounts by having his bookkeeper prepare checks to cover the fund shortage.   He signed each check and frequently deposited them himself.   The Seventh Circuit held that this behavior was not \"aberrant.\"  895 F.2d at 324-25.   Uncertainty about the reason for the district court\\'s refusal to depart precluded this court from deciding that issue in Russell.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      Circuit courts are divided over where criminal conduct must fall on the aberrant behavior spectrum to justify downward departure.   As we noted in Catucci, some have adopted an expansive view of what aberrant behavior means in the context of the Guidelines, whereas others require a spontaneous or thoughtless act of the sort committed by the defendant in Russell.   The Seventh Circuit\\'s decision in Carey provided the moorings for the latter group of circuits.   The Carey court held that \"[a] single act of aberrant behavior ... generally contemplates a spontaneous and seemingly thoughtless act rather than one which was the result of substantial planning because an act which occurs suddenly and is not the result of a continued reflective process is one for which the defendant may be arguably less accountable.\"  895 F.2d at 325.   The Seventh Circuit later reinforced this tight interpretation in United States v. Andruska, 964 F.2d 640, 645-46 (7th Cir.1992), a decision reversing a district court\\'s decision to depart downward in a case involving a woman found guilty of concealing her fugitive paramour from arrest.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      The Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits have embraced the Seventh Circuit\\'s view of aberrant behavior.   For example, in Marcello, supra, the Third Circuit explained that \"there must be some element of abnormal or exceptional behavior\" before adopting the Seventh Circuit\\'s spontaneity requirement and reversing the district court\\'s decision to depart downward.  13 F.3d at 761.   The Marcello defendant was an attorney who, on seven separate occasions, structured bank deposits to avoid tax reporting requirements in violation of 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5322(a), 5324(a)(3).   He committed these offenses over the span of seven consecutive working days.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      Cases involving extensive planning or repeated criminal acts received similar treatment in the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits.   In United States v. Glick, 946 F.2d 335, 338 (4th Cir.1991), the Fourth Circuit reversed a downward departure decision after noting that the defendant transported letters containing stolen trade secrets across state lines on several occasions.   In Williams, supra, the Fifth Circuit affirmed a district court\\'s refusal to depart downward because the robbery executed by the defendant involved planning.   Similarly, the Eighth Circuit found that a bank fraud scheme carried out over a one year period lacked the level of spontaneity and thoughtlessness required by cases such as Carey.   See United States v. Garlich, 951 F.2d 161, 164 (8th Cir.1991);  see also Premachandra, 32 F.3d at 349.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      In contrast, the Ninth and Tenth Circuits have eschewed any focus on spontaneity and thoughtlessness, opting instead for a broad view of aberrant behavior.   They require reviewing courts to employ the totality of the circumstances test in making aberrant behavior determinations.   Under this test, courts consider a variety of mitigating factors, such as pecuniary gain to the defendant, prior good deeds, and an effort to mitigate the effects of the crime in evaluating whether a defendant\\'s conduct was unusual or, more specifically, \"aberrant.\"   See, e.g., United States v. Takai, 941 F.2d 738, 741 (9th Cir.1991).\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      In Takai, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\\'s decision to depart downward after finding that the defendants who pled guilty to bribery of and conspiracy to bribe an Immigration and Naturalization Service official, inter alia, received no pecuniary gain, had no criminal record, and had been influenced by a government agent.   A convergence of factors, such as the defendant\\'s manic depression, suicidal tendencies, and recent unemployment, also led the Ninth Circuit to affirm downward departure in Fairless, supra, an armed robbery case.   Similarly, in United States v. Pena, 930 F.2d 1486, 1494 (10th Cir.1991), a drug possession case, the Tenth Circuit held that downward departure was appropriate because the defendant\\'s behavior was an aberration from her usual conduct, which was highlighted by long-term employment, no abuse or prior distribution of controlled substances, and economic support of her family.\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      We are persuaded, after reviewing the cases decided by our colleagues in other circuits, that the approach taken by the Ninth and Tenth Circuits achieves the balance between uniformity in sentencing and district court discretion the Guidelines were intended to strike.   See Jackson, 30 F.3d at 201-02.   We, thus, hold that determinations about whether an offense constitutes a single act of aberrant behavior should be made by reviewing the totality of the circumstances.   District court judges may consider, inter alia, factors such as pecuniary gain to the defendant, charitable activities, prior good deeds, and efforts to mitigate the effects of the crime in deciding whether a defendant\\'s conduct is aberrant in terms of other crimes.   See DeMasi, 40 F.3d at 1324 (departure determination should be made by comparing case to other cases involving the stated reason for departure).   Spontaneity and thoughtlessness may also be among the factors considered, though they are not prerequisites for departure.\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      That aberrant behavior departures are available to first offenders whose course of criminal conduct involves more than one criminal act is implicit in our holding.   See Takai, 941 F.2d at 743.   We think the Commission intended the word \"single\" to refer to the crime committed and not to the various acts involved.   As a result, we read the Guidelines\\' reference to \"single acts of aberrant behavior\" to include multiple acts leading up to the commission of a crime.   See id.   Any other reading would produce an absurd result.   District courts would be reduced to counting the number of acts involved in the commission of a crime to determine whether departure is warranted.   Moreover, the practical effect of such an interpretation would be to make aberrant behavior departures virtually unavailable to most defendants because almost every crime involves a series of criminal acts.   Even the Russell defendant, whose spontaneous actions are widely regarded as a classic example of aberrant behavior, could be understood to have committed more than a single act of aberrant behavior.   He conspired with his partner to take money from the armored truck he drove;  took the money;  and then kept the money for a short period of time.   Thus, we think that focusing on the crime of conviction instead of the criminal acts committed in carrying out that crime best comports with what the Commission intended.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      The approach we now adopt does not unnecessarily expand opportunities for departure under the Guidelines.   The totality of the circumstances test, though admittedly broader than the spontaneity test employed in Carey, is consistent with the Commission\\'s intention to limit applications of the aberrant behavior principle.   See Andruska, 964 F.2d at 645.   Concerns that it ensures every first offender a downward departure from their Guidelines-imposed sentence are without foundation.   As the Ninth Circuit explained in United States v. Dickey, 924 F.2d 836 (9th Cir.1991), \"aberrant behavior and first offense are not synonymous.\"  924 F.2d at 838;  see Glick, 946 F.2d at 338.   Without more, first-offender status is not enough to warrant downward departure.\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      District courts are not, however, precluded from considering first-offender status as a factor in the departure calculus.   Departure-phase consideration of a defendant\\'s criminal record does not, we think, wrongly duplicate the calculations involved in establishing a defendant\\'s criminal history category under the Guidelines.   First, as we just noted, it is obviously not the case that every defendant in Criminal History Category I will be qualified for an aberrant behavior departure.   There will be individuals in that category who, for instance, are not entitled to departure because they were convicted of several unrelated offenses or who have been regular participants in elaborate criminal enterprises.   See Morales, 972 F.2d at 1011.   Second, to the extent that considering a defendant\\'s criminal record at both the criminal history and departure stages amounts to double counting, the Guidelines clearly permit it.   But see Marcello, 13 F.3d at 755 (3d Cir.)  (concluding that the Guidelines prohibit considering a defendant\\'s criminal record at both the criminal history and departure stages).   The Guidelines explain that \"the court may depart ... even though the reason for departure is taken into consideration ... if the court determines that, in light of unusual circumstances, the guideline level attached to that factor is inadequate.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      The question now becomes whether defendant\\'s conduct falls within the ambit of aberrant behavior under the standard we have articulated.   We leave this to the district court\\'s discretion.   It occupies the best vantage point from which to make the decision.  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 950.   We, therefore, vacate defendant\\'s sentence and remand for resentencing.\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      B. Extraordinary Offender Characteristics as a Basis for Downward Departure.\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      Defendant\\'s second argument on appeal is that the district court misunderstood its authority to depart on the ground of his extraordinary characteristics.   We agree that extraordinary characteristics such as unusual family obligations or exceptional charitable activities may, in certain circumstances, provide a basis for a downward departure.   See, e.g., United States v. Haversat, 22 F.3d 790, 795-96 (8th Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S. Ct. 671, 133 L. Ed. 2d 521 (1995);  United States v. Canoy, 38 F.3d 893, 905-07 (7th Cir.1994);  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948-53;  United States v. Sclamo, 997 F.2d 970, 973-74 (1st Cir.1993);  Pena, 930 F.2d at 1495;  United States v. Big Crow, 898 F.2d 1326, 1332 (8th Cir.1990).   We disagree, however, that the district court misunderstood its authority to depart.   It appears clear that the court found that defendant\\'s family obligations and charitable activities, though noteworthy, were neither extraordinary nor exceptional.\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      The best indicator of the district court\\'s unwillingness to depart downward on the basis of extraordinary characteristics is the stark difference between the court\\'s sentencing-hearing statements about departure on this basis and on the grounds of aberrant behavior.   When asked to make a finding about defendant\\'s extraordinary offender characteristics claim, the district court stated:\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      THE COURT:  To the extent you\\'ve asked me to depart based on that, I would find that those, extraordinary commitment to family and extraordinary offender characteristics, don\\'t rise to the level that would justify a departure out of the heartland of the guidelines ... So to the extent I have discretion in that regard, I exercise my discretion not to depart downward.\\n    \\n    \\n      43\\n      These statements make it plain that the district court\\'s refusal to depart stemmed from an exercise of discretion.   See DeCosta, 37 F.3d at 8 (\"[we suggest] ... [t]hat the district court say ... that it has considered the mitigating factors urged but does not find them sufficiently unusual to warrant a departure in the case at hand.\").   And even if we were to assume that these statements are ambiguous, that ambiguity, without more, would not be enough to make the district court\\'s refusal to depart appealable.  Morrison, 46 F.3d at 132;  see United States v. Romero, 32 F.3d 641, 654 (1st Cir.1994).   Our review of this matter is, thus, at an end.   We lack jurisdiction to review the district court\\'s refusal to depart downward on the basis of extraordinary offender characteristics.  Byrd, 53 F.3d at 145;  Gifford, 17 F.3d at 473.\\n    \\n    \\n      44\\n      C. The Heartland of Section 2C1.7 of the Guidelines.\\n    \\n    \\n      45\\n      Defendant\\'s final argument on appeal concerns the scope of section 2C1.7 of the Guidelines, which corresponds to 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1346, the mail fraud statute to which he pled guilty.   Without disputing section 2C1.7\\'s general applicability to his conduct, defendant maintains that the district court misapprehended its authority to impose a shorter prison term by departing downward, by analogy, to the sentence prescribed under section 2C1.3 of the Guidelines.   For individuals in Criminal History Category I, section 2C1.3--which concerns conflicts of interest by present and former federal officers and employees--carries a sentencing range of zero to six months.   Section 2C1.7 imposes a sentencing range of eighteen to twenty-four months for individuals in the same category.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2C1.7 (Fraud Involving Deprivation of the Intangible Right to the Honest Services of Public Officials);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2C1.3 (Conflict of Interest).\\n    \\n    \\n      46\\n      Though cast as a claim relating to the district court\\'s refusal to depart, defendant\\'s argument, at its core, primarily concerns the heartland of section 2C1.7 of the Guidelines.   Defendant essentially argues that his conduct falls outside the heartland of section 2C1.7 and within the scope of section 2C1.3 because it primarily involved a conflict of interest, not fraud.   Because questions concerning the scope and meaning of a guideline, unlike questions pertaining to the facts which lead a district court to render its departure decision, are quintessentially legal in nature, see LeBlanc, 24 F.3d at 345, Rivera, 994 F.2d at 952, we have jurisdiction to review defendant\\'s claim.   Our review is plenary, as it is whenever a district court\\'s decision \"reflect[s] a determination of the purpose of, or an interpretation of the language in, a guideline or statute.\"  LeBlanc, 24 F.3d at 344;  see United States v. Rosales, 19 F.3d 763, 769 (1st Cir.1994).\\n    \\n    \\n      47\\n      To determine whether defendant\\'s conduct is of the sort which generally falls within section 2C1.7\\'s \"heartland,\" we must determine the nature of the underlying crime of mail fraud.   See, e.g., LeBlanc, 24 F.3d at 346.   We look in part to the language of the mail fraud statute and to the legislative history which accompanies it.  Id.  In relevant part, section 1341 provides:\\n    \\n    \\n      48\\n      Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises ... for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, [uses the mail system or causes it to be used] shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.   If the violation affects a financial institution, such person shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.\\n    \\n    \\n      49\\n      Congress enacted this statute in 1872, as \"a general proscription against using the mails to initiate correspondence in furtherance of \\'any scheme or artifice to defraud.\\' \"  McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 356, 359, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 2879, 2881, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292 (1987).   The legislative history suggests that Congress intended the mail fraud statute to protect people from \"schemes to deprive them of their money or property.\"  Id. at 356, 107 S.Ct. at 2880.   Before 1987, section 1341 was read as a broad shield, protecting individuals against schemes to deprive them of intangible, as well as tangible, property.   Then, in 1987, the Supreme Court held that the statute did not embrace intangible rights.  McNally held that the mail fraud statute does not prohibit schemes to defraud individuals of their intangible rights to the honest services of government.  483 U.S. at 359-60, 107 S.Ct. at 2881-82;  see Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 25, 108 S. Ct. 316, 320, 98 L. Ed. 2d 275 (1987).\\n    \\n    \\n      50\\n      In 1988, Congress enacted section 1346, the honest services amendment, to reverse the Supreme Court\\'s decision in McNally.  United States v. Bucuvalas, 970 F.2d 937, 942 n. 9 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Alkins, 925 F.2d 541, 548 (2d Cir.1991);  McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. v. Heritage Travel, Inc., 904 F.2d 786, 790 (1st Cir.1990);  see 134 Cong.Rec. S17360-02 (daily ed. November 10, 1988) (Judiciary Committee analysis) (\"This section overturns the decision in McNally v. United States ... Under [this] amendment, [the mail and wire fraud] statutes will protect ... the right of the public to the honest services of public officials.\").   Section 1346 became effective on November 18, 1988 and provides:\\n    \\n    \\n      51\\n      For the purposes of this chapter, the term \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\\n    \\n    \\n      52\\n      See Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-690, Title VII, &#167; 7603(a), 102 Stat. 4508 (1988).   It restores mail fraud convictions to their pre-McNally status by allowing the government to predicate mail fraud prosecutions on deprivations of the intangible right of honest services.  United States v. Bryan, 58 F.3d 933, 940 n. 1 (4th Cir.1995);  Waymer, 55 F.3d at 568 n. 3;  see 135 Cong.Rec. S1063 (daily ed. February 2, 1989) (statement of Sen.  Biden).  An offense under section 1346 is established when the evidence demonstrates that the use of the mail system played a role in executing the deprivation of the honest services of government.  Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 710, 109 S. Ct. 1443, 1447-48, 103 L. Ed. 2d 734 (1989) (citing Kann v. United States, 323 U.S. 88, 95, 65 S. Ct. 148, 151, 89 L. Ed. 88 (1944));  see United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 890, 892 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Dray, 901 F.2d 1132, 1137 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 895, 111 S. Ct. 245, 112 L. Ed. 2d 204 (1990).\\n    \\n    \\n      53\\n      Section 1346 includes cases in which the mail system plays an integral role in the scheme to defraud citizenry of the honest services of government, as well as schemes in which use of the mail system is only incidental to the larger plan.  Id. at 710-11, 109 S.Ct. at 1447-48;  see United States v. Morrow, 39 F.3d 1228, 1236-37 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S. Ct. 1421, 131 L. Ed. 2d 304 (1995) (mail fraud generally includes incidental use of the mails in furtherance of a scheme to defraud).   The Eleventh Circuit recently affirmed a defendant\\'s conviction on twenty-two counts of mail fraud even though the defendant only used the mail system to receive payments from his partner in a money laundering the scheme.   In Waymer, supra, the court rejected claims that section 1346 is vague and overbroad and reiterated the Supreme Court\\'s conclusion in Schmuck, supra, that \"[i]t is sufficient for the mailing to be \\'incident to an essential part of the scheme\\' or \\'a step in the plot.\\' \"  55 F.3d at 569;  see also Badders v. United States, 240 U.S. 391, 393-94, 36 S. Ct. 367, 367-68, 60 L. Ed. 706 (1916).   In Waymer, the defendant was an elected member of the Atlanta Board of Education who failed to fully disclose his relationship with the contractor who provided pest control services to Atlanta\\'s public schools.   Unbeknownst to the other school board members, the defendant received fifteen percent of all the proceeds from the contractor\\'s contracts with the school system.\\n    \\n    \\n      54\\n      Courts have read section 1346 to include efforts by public officials and employees to conceal their fraudulent acts from the public \"by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, promises, or other deceptive conduct.\"   See McEvoy Travel, 904 F.2d at 791.   For example, the Fourth Circuit recently upheld the conviction of a public official on such grounds in United States v. Bryan, 58 F.3d 933 (4th Cir.1995).   In that case, the Director of the West Virginia Lottery orchestrated a scheme whereby he secretly ensured that lottery contracts and contract bids were awarded to companies with whom he had a personal relationship.   The Fourth Circuit held that section 1346 applied to the defendant\\'s conduct.  58 F.3d at 939-41.   Similarly, United States v. Alkins, 925 F.2d 541 (2d Cir.1991), a Second Circuit case, upheld the section 1346-based convictions of six Department of Motor Vehicles employees because they failed to disclose their fraudulent activities to department officials.  925 F.2d at 549.   The defendants in that case secretly processed improperly documented applications for driver\\'s licenses, identification cards, and vehicle registrations in return for monetary disbursements.\\n    \\n    \\n      55\\n      We hold that the conduct to which Grandmaison pled guilty falls within the range of conduct Congress intended 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1346 to encompass and, concomitantly, rests squarely within the heartland of section 2C1.7.   Grandmaison continued to lobby Board members on behalf of Eckman Construction after his recusal from the SSCC and JSSBC.   He secretly delivered gratuities to Magee, Ackerman, and Kuchinski to secure favorable votes on Eckman Construction\\'s bid.   He distributed informational materials about Eckman Construction to Magee and Ackerman without disclosing his actions to other Board members.   And he caused the Elm Street Project contract to be sent to Eckman Construction via the mail system.   Though there is no evidence that Grandmaison received direct monetary benefit from his actions, there can be little doubt that under cases such as Waymer, Bryan, and Alkins he deprived the citizens of Nashua of the honest services of their government under section 1346.   This is not an unusual case.\\n    \\n    \\n      56\\n      Defendant maintains that he is mainly guilty of not revealing a conflict of interest.   To be sure, his conduct involved some element of such a violation.   It does not follow from this, however, that he should not be sentenced pursuant to section 2C1.7, the guideline corresponding to the mail fraud statute to which he pled guilty.   First, we are convinced that 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1346 encompasses crimes of the sort committed by defendant.   Second, even if the applicability of section 1346 were suspect, we are not at all certain that downward departure to the sentence prescribed by section 2C1.3 would be appropriate.   This is principally because section 2C1.3 linguistically does not apply to defendant or his conduct;  that guideline only addresses conflicts of interests by present or former federal officers and employees and, therefore, does not reach state or local officials such as defendant.   In the final analysis, defendant has managed to persuade us of only one thing:  that had he been a federal employee or official, the government might have been able to charge him with violating other statutes as well.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2C1.3 (listing statutory provisions corresponding to that guideline).   Because this argument clearly does not merit the application of a lower sentencing range defendant seeks, we affirm the district court\\'s refusal to depart downward by analogy to section 2C1.3.\\n    \\n    V. CONCLUSION\\n    \\n      57\\n      For the foregoing reasons, we vacate Grandmaison\\'s sentence and remand for resentencing under the aberrant behavior standard formulated in this opinion.   Defendant\\'s appeal for downward departure on the basis of his extraordinary offender characteristics is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.   And we affirm the district court\\'s refusal to depart downward by analogy to section 2C1.3 of the Guidelines.\\n    \\n    \\n      58\\n      It is so ordered.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        *\\n         Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 196611}]"},{"id":2668487,"date_filed":"2009-03-09","judges":"Judge Reggie B.

This matter is now before the Court on the\\n\\ndefendant\\'s motion for summary judgment, Defendant\\'s Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.\\'s\\n\\nMot.\"), which the plaintiff opposes, Opposition of Plaintiff Melvin C. Porter to Defendant\\'s\\n\\nMotion for Summary Judgment (\"Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n\"). 1 For the following reasons, the Court must\\n\\naward summary judgment to the Agency.\\n\\n\\n1\\n        The defendant filed a reply to the plaintiff\\'s opposition, Reply to Plaintiff\\'s Opposition to\\nDefendant\\'s Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.\\'s Reply\"), which the Court has also considered in\\nresolving this motion.\\n\\x0c                                       I. BACKGROUND\\n\\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the facts underlying this\\n\\nlawsuit are the following.\\n\\n       The plaintiff, an African-American male, was employed in the Agency\\'s Office of Human\\n\\nResources from 1985 to 1995, until being transferred to the Agency\\'s Bureau of Policy and\\n\\nProgram Coordination where he was assigned when this case was filed. Second Amended\\n\\nComplaint (\"Second Am. Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. The plaintiff joined the Agency in 1985 as a GS-13\\n\\ngrade level employee, and was elevated to the GS-14 grade level after two years; however, since\\n\\n1987, his pay grade level has not been increased. Id. \u00b6 8.\\n\\n       Since 1988, the plaintiff alleges that the Agency\\'s acts of discrimination and retaliation\\n\\nhave stymied his advancement. And, between 1988 and 1991, the plaintiff filed four EEO\\n\\ncomplaints alleging that the Agency committed various discriminatory and retaliatory acts\\n\\nagainst him based upon his race and gender, and in response to his complaints against the\\n\\nAgency. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. The Agency settled the plaintiff\\'s first round of complaints in 1992,\\n\\nawarding him monetary damages, a retroactive temporary promotion, training, and attorneys\\'\\n\\nfees. Id. \u00b6 10. Following the settlement, the plaintiff filed three additional EEO complaints over\\n\\nthe next several years against the Agency, again alleging discrimination and retaliation. Id. \u00b6 11.\\n\\nIn 1995, the Agency settled the plaintiff\\'s second round of complaints, agreeing to transfer him\\n\\nfrom the Office of Human Resources to the Bureau for Policy and Program Coordination, as well\\n\\nas awarding him additional \"compensatory damages, a revised performance appraisal, a\\n\\nretroactive merit increase and performance award, and attorneys\\' fees.\" Id.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 2\\n\\x0c       In 2000, the plaintiff, frustrated that he still had not been promoted to the GS-15 level,\\n\\nsought additional relief in this Court. Id. \u00b6 13; see generally Complaint (\"Compl.\"), Porter v.\\n\\nU.S. Agency for Int\\'l Dev. (\"Porter I\"), Civ. No. 00-1954 (D.D.C. Aug. 11, 2000); First\\n\\nAmended Complaint (\"Am. Compl.\"), Porter I (D.D.C. May 2, 2001). On June 5, 2002, a jury in\\n\\nthat case found for the plaintiff on two of the six counts of his amended complaint, specifically\\n\\nfinding that the defendant had engaged in \"retaliation in connection with the [d]efendant\\'s\\n\\ndecision[s] not to select [the plaintiff]\" for two positions for which he applied in 1998. Jury\\n\\nVerdict at 2, Porter I (D.D.C. June 5, 2002). The plaintiff requested and the Court entered a\\n\\njudgment in his favor, which, among other things, forbid the Agency from engaging in any\\n\\nfurther retaliation against the plaintiff. Judgment at 2, Porter I (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2003);\\n\\nMemorandum & Order at 1-2, Porter I (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2003).\\n\\n       After receiving the partially favorable jury verdict in Porter I and the issuances of an\\n\\naccompanying order from the Court which forbid the Agency from retaliating against him, on\\n\\nJune 24, 2003, in post-trial proceedings, the plaintiff filed a motion requesting that the Agency\\n\\nshow cause why it should not be found in violation of the Court\\'s 2003 order enjoining the\\n\\nAgency from retaliating against him based on what the plaintiff characterized as \"two adverse\\n\\nemployment actions.\" Plaintiff\u2019s Memorandum in Support of His Motion for an Order to Show\\n\\nCause Why Defendant Should Not be Held in Contempt and Authorizing Plaintiff to Take\\n\\nDiscovery (\"Pl.\\'s Show Cause Mem.\") at 2, Porter I (D.D.C. June 24, 2003). Namely, that the\\n\\nplaintiff claimed that the Agency\\'s decision not to grant him a 2001 performance bonus and his\\n\\nreceipt of a \"Needs Improvement\" assessment for his 2002 performance amounted to retaliation.\\n\\nId. While the Court granted the motion to the extent that it compelled the Agency to respond,\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  3\\n\\x0cOrder, Porter I (D.D.C. June 27, 2003), after reviewing the evidentiary support offered by both\\n\\nparties, the Court discharged the show cause order on the merits and denied the plaintiff\\'s request\\n\\nto conduct discovery with regards to the two purported adverse employment actions, Order \u00b6 2,\\n\\nPorter I (D.D.C. Nov. 25, 2003); see also Order at 1, Porter I (D.D.C. May 25, 2005).\\n\\n       Meanwhile, throughout the pendency of Porter I, the plaintiff continued to apply for GS-\\n\\n15 grade level positions for which he was not selected by the Agency. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\\n\\n15-22. He now challenges those actions of the Agency alleging that he was denied the\\n\\npromotions for discriminatory and retaliatory reasons. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that\\n\\nseveral days after he initiated Porter I, he applied for a Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist\\n\\nposition at the GS-15 grade level. Id. \u00b6 15. And in 2001, while Porter I was still pending, the\\n\\nplaintiff also applied for an Administrative Officer position at the GS-15 grade level, id. \u00b6 18, as\\n\\nwell as a Deputy Chief position in the Personnel Operations Division at the GS-15 grade level,\\n\\nid. \u00b6 21. In each case, the Agency did not select the plaintiff for the positions. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 15-22.\\n\\n       On August 24, 2004, the plaintiff instituted this action under Title VII alleging that, with\\n\\nrespect to these non-selections, as well as other employment actions, the Agency engaged in\\n\\ndiscriminatory employment practices because of the plaintiff\\'s race and gender, and retaliatory\\n\\nemployment practices due to the plaintiff\\'s participation in a protected activity, i.e., his 2001\\n\\nlawsuit against the defendant and related EEO complaints. See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-30; see also\\n\\nSecond Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-63. In addition, the plaintiff asserts the following claims arising from\\n\\nfour additional incidents of alleged discrimination and retaliation: (1) the denial of a performance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  4\\n\\x0cbonus award for the work he performed in 2001, despite his overall rating of \"Excellent,\" 2 id. \u00b6\\n\\n24; (2) his supervisor\\'s \"Needs Improvement\" evaluation in February 2003, with respect to his\\n\\n2002 job performance, id. \u00b6 25; (3) the mid-year \"borderline unacceptable\" oral assessment he\\n\\nreceived with respect to his 2003 job performance, id. \u00b6 27; and (4) his receipt of an interim\\n\\n\"Unacceptable\" assessment in September 2004, with respect to his 2004 job performance, id. \u00b6\\n\\n28.\\n\\n        On July 21, 2006, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to\\n\\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 stating that there are no genuine issues of material facts in\\n\\nthis case, and the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Def.\\'s Mot. at 1.\\n\\nSpecifically, the defendant contends: (1) as to Counts I-VI of the second amended complaint, 3\\n\\nwhich challenge the Agency\\'s promotion decisions, each claim should be dismissed because the\\n\\nindividuals selected were more qualified for the positions than was the plaintiff, Memorandum of\\n\\nPoints and Authorities in Support of Defendant\\'s Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.\\'s\\n\\nMem.\") at 2; (2) Counts III, IV, VII, IX, and X should be dismissed because the plaintiff failed to\\n\\nexhaust his administrative remedies as to these claims, id. at 2, 4, 7-9, 22-24; (3) Counts VII-\\n\\nXIV, which challenge the Agency\\'s \"denial of a bonus award and certain performance\\n\\nappraisals,\" should be dismissed because they are \"unmeritorious,\" and allege \"nothing more\\n2\\n        The ratings scale ranks performances from one through five, with one representing\\n\"Unacceptable,\" two representing \"Need Improvement,\" three representing \"Effective,\" four representing\\n\"Excellent,\" and five representing \"Exceptional.\" Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28.\\n3\\n        The defendant contends that Counts I-VII of the plaintiff\\'s Second Amended Complaint pertain to\\nthe Agency\\'s promotion decisions and the remaining claims, Counts VIII-XIV, pertain to the Agency\\'s\\n\"alleged denial of a bonus award and certain performance appraisals.\" Memorandum of Points and\\nAuthorities in Support of Defendant\\'s Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.\\'s Mem.\") at 1-2. It appears,\\nhowever, that Count VII asserts a Title VII claim against the Agency for allegedly \"denying [the plaintiff]\\na performance bonus award,\" Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 45, and should be grouped with the latter category of\\nclaims, not the former.\\n\\n\\n                                                    5\\n\\x0cthan personality disputes, complaints about management style or the normal trials and\\n\\ntribulations of any workplace,\" id. at 2; and (4) Counts VII-XIV are barred by res judicata, id. at\\n\\n3-4.\\n\\n        In response, the plaintiff contends that summary judgment is improper because: (1) as to\\n\\neach claim he has made out a prima facie case that the defendant\\'s actions amounted to unlawful\\n\\ndiscrimination or retaliation based on his race or gender, or in response to his prior protected\\n\\nactivity, and any non-discriminatory or non-retaliatory reasons offered by the Agency for its\\n\\ndecisions not to select him are merely pretextual, Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 14, 16, 22, 26, 33, 54; (2) the\\n\\nexistence of genuine issues of material fact regarding whether his performance rating was an\\n\\nadverse employment action precludes summary judgment, id. at 31; (3) the acts alleged in his\\n\\nCounts VII-XIV relate to events that occurred after the verdict in Porter I was rendered and\\n\\ntherefore are not barred by res judicata as they \"were not pled, litigated or adjudicated\" in Porter\\n\\nI, id. at 14; and (4) he has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to Counts III, IV,\\n\\nand X, 4 id. at 52, 68.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n         The plaintiff does not contest the defendant\\'s motion for summary judgment as to Counts VII, IX,\\nXI, and XIII, and the portion of Count V which alleges racial discrimination. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 2. As the\\nbasis for why judgment is proper on these counts, the defendant argues that the plaintiff has failed to\\nexhaust his administrative remedies as to these claims. Def.\\'s Mem. at 7-9, 22-24. Accordingly, the\\nCourt will dismiss these claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) as failing to state claims\\nupon which relief can be granted. See Fox v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 389 F.3d 1291, 1294-95 (D.C. Cir.\\n2004) (holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by applying a \"straightforward\"\\napplication of Local Rule 7(b) in granting as conceded the defendant\\'s motion to dismiss when the\\nplaintiffs failed to oppose it); Bancoult v. McNamara, 227 F. Supp. 2d 144, 149 (D.D.C. 2002) (\"[I]f the\\nopposing party files a responsive memorandum, but fails to address certain arguments made by the\\nmoving party, the court may treat those arguments as conceded, even when the result is dismissal of the\\nentire case.\").\\n\\n\\n                                                    6\\n\\x0c                                   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n        To grant a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56(c), this Court must find that \"the\\n\\npleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no\\n\\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\\n\\nlaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court must\\n\\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Bayer v. U.S. Dep\\'t of\\n\\nTreasury, 956 F.2d 330, 333 (D.C. Cir.1992). However, the non-moving party cannot rely on\\n\\n\"\\'mere allegations or denials . . . , but . . . must set forth specific facts showing that there [are]\\n\\ngenuine issue[s] for trial.\\'\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986) (citation\\n\\nomitted) (some alterations in original). Under Rule 56(c), if a party fails to \"establish the\\n\\nexistence of an element essential to that party\\'s case, and on which that party will bear the burden\\n\\nof proof at trial,\" summary judgment is warranted. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322\\n\\n(1986). However, the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of establishing the\\n\\nabsence of evidence that supports the non-moving party\\'s case. Id. at 325.\\n\\n                                      III. LEGAL ANALYSIS\\n\\nA.      Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\\n\\n        A plaintiff who fails to exhaust the administrative remedies available to him in pursing a\\n\\nclaim of discrimination or retaliation, and who is not otherwise excused from doing so, may not\\n\\nseek relief from a United States district court on those claims under Title VII.

The plaintiff counters that he has exhausted his\\n\\nadministrative remedies, and all of his claims are therefore properly before the Court.

Def.\\'s Mem. at 9. In support of its argument, the defendant contends\\n\\nthat the forty-five day period commenced on April 25, 2001. Id. The plaintiff\\'s second amended\\n\\ncomplaint, however, states that the alleged discrimination asserted in Counts III and IV occurred\\n\\nin \"May 2001,\" Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 18, and the plaintiff\\'s statement of undisputed material\\n\\nfacts clarifies that it was specifically on May 28, 2001, when the Agency selected another\\n\\ncandidate for the Administrative Officer position, Plaintiff\\'s Rule 7.1(h) Statement in Response\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n         Based on the plaintiff\\'s concession to the grant of summary judgment on Counts VII, IX, XI, and\\nXIII, as well as the portion of Count V, which alleges racial discrimination, note 4, supra, the Court will\\nnot address the defendant\\'s arguments regarding the plaintiff\\'s alleged failure to exhaust his administrative\\nremedies with respect to any of these Counts.\\n\\n\\n                                                     8\\n\\x0cto Defendant\\'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Pl.\\'s Facts Statement\") \u00b6 186. Thus, the\\n\\nplaintiff contends that his administrative claim was filed timely.\\n\\n       The question, therefore, is whether April 25, 2001, or May 28, 2001, was the date when\\n\\nthe 45-day time period began to run. The plaintiff argues that although the Administrative\\n\\nOfficer position at issue was classified as GS-15 on April 25, 2001, Pl.\\'s Facts Statement \u00b6 185, it\\n\\nwas the awarding of that position to another candidate, and thus the denial of the position to the\\n\\nplaintiff on May 28, 2001, that amounted to discrimination and retaliation about which he is\\n\\ncomplaining, Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35, 38. Because the Court must consider the facts in the\\n\\nlight most favorable to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff contends that May 28, 2001, is the operative\\n\\ndate when the forty-five day time period commenced, the Court finds that the plaintiff\\'s June 13,\\n\\n2001 administrative complaint was filed within the required time frame, and that the plaintiff has\\n\\ntherefore exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to Counts III and IV.\\n\\n       As to Count X, which concerns the plaintiff\\'s challenge to his 2002 \"Needs\\n\\nImprovement\" performance assessment, the defendant contends that while the plaintiff initially\\n\\nsuspected that he was the subject of retaliation in early 2002, he did not file an administrative\\n\\ncomplaint until October 4, 2002. Def.\\'s Mem. at 23. The plaintiff seemingly contends that \"[o]n\\n\\nFebruary 21, 2003, the Agency discriminated against [him]\" when it provided him with the 2002\\n\\n\"Needs Improvement\" performance evaluation. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 25. This evaluation was\\n\\nrendered after the plaintiff filed his November 2002 EEO complaint against the Agency based on\\n\\nhis supervisor\\'s refusal to award him a bonus. Pl.\\'s Facts Statement \u00b6 70. Therefore, while that\\n\\nEEO complaint did not contest his 2002 \"Needs Improvement\" performance rating, Pl.\\'s Facts\\n\\nStatement, Exhibit (\"Ex.\") 32 (Individual Complaint Form for Employment Discrimination) at 2,\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 9\\n\\x0cthe plaintiff maintains that \"in early March 2003, [he] contacted an EEO counselor regarding\\n\\n[his] claim [concerning his 2002 \\'Needs Improvement\\' performance rating]\" and sought to amend\\n\\nthe November 2002 complaint to include that allegation, Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 52; Pl.\\'s Facts Statement,\\n\\nEx. 49 (E-mail from Melvin Porter to David Grim (Mar. 10, 2003)). Specifically, the plaintiff\\n\\nstates that \"[o]n March 10, 2003, [he] e-mailed an EEO Counselor, asking that his challenge to\\n\\nthe 2002 Needs Improvement Assessment be added to his challenge of the bonus denial, which\\n\\nhad been pending since October 2002 [sic].\" Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 52. In addition, the plaintiff\\n\\nmaintains that the questionnaire provided to the plaintiff\\'s supervisor regarding the plaintiff\\'s\\n\\nNovember 22, 2002 administrative complaint included questions concerning his 2002 Needs\\n\\nImprovement Assessment. Pl.\\'s Facts Statement, Ex. 50 (Affidavit of Barbara Turner) at 1.\\n\\nTherefore, in reading the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the Court must find that\\n\\nthe plaintiff has not failed to exhaust his remedies with respect to his 2002 Needs Improvement\\n\\nassessment, as alleged in Count X of his second amended complaint, because he constructively\\n\\namended his November 2002 EEO complaint to include a claim with respect to the 2002\\n\\nassessment. 6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n          In addition, based on the Agency\\'s investigation of the plaintiff\\'s complaints, Pl.\\'s Facts\\nStatement, Ex. 50 (Affidavit of Barbara Turner) at 1, and in the absence of any evidence in the record\\nthat, in response to the plaintiff\\'s seeking to amend his November 2002 EEO complaint with the new\\ninformation, the Agency rejected the plaintiff\\'s amendment or informed him that the would need to file a\\nnew complaint, see Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 52; Pl.\\'s Facts Statement, Ex. 49 (E-mail from Melvin Porter to David\\nGrim (Mar. 10, 2003)), the Court cannot find that the Agency can now credibly argue that the plaintiff\\'s\\nfailure to file a formal administrative complaint precludes him from litigating these matters. See Brown\\nv. Marsh, 777 F.2d 8, 16 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (finding the doctrine of equitable estoppel prevented the\\ndefendant from arguing that the plaintiff\\'s \"failure to timely consult an EEO counselor\" barred the\\nplaintiff\\'s Title VII suit because \"[t]he Army . . . led [the plaintiff] to believe that it was considering and\\ninvestigating his complaints from the outset of this matter\").\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                      10\\n\\x0cB.

The defendant\\n\\nmaintains that the member of this Court who presided over Porter I rendered a final judgment on\\n\\nthose matters in post-judgment proceedings. Id. The plaintiff responds that Porter I \"did not\\n\\nencompass any of the claims asserted in this case,\" and because the allegations of retaliation that\\n\\nhe makes here \"were not pled, litigated, or adjudicated by judge or jury in the earlier case,\" res\\n\\njudicata does not bar him from bringing them in this action. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 15. The Court agrees\\n\\nwith the defendant as to Counts VIII and X, but disagrees that res judicata bars Counts XII and\\n\\nXIV.\\n\\n        Two preliminary matters are beyond dispute: the parties in this lawsuit are identical to\\n\\nthose in Porter I, and this Court, a court of competent jurisdiction, presided in that litigation,\\n\\nwhich was resolved by a final judgment on the merits. See, e.g., Porter I, 293 F. Supp. 2d 152,\\n\\n158 (D.D.C. 2003) (awarding attorneys\\' fees). Therefore, the only issue that remains as to\\n\\nwhether the claims being challenged on res judicata grounds are barred from consideration in this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n         The Court takes judicial notice of the court record in Porter I, as well as those excerpts extracted\\nfrom the parties\\' filings in that case. See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)-(c) (\"A court may take judicial notice,\\nwhether requested or not\" of any fact that is \"not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1)\\ngenerally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready\\ndetermination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\"); see, e.g., Coleman\\nv. Burnett, 477 F.2d 1187, 1198 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (wherein the Circuit Court \"[e]xercis[ed] [its] power to\\njudicially notice proceedings in related cases\").\\n\\n\\n                                                     12\\n\\x0ccase is whether the claims that the plaintiff now advances were among those claims on which the\\n\\nCourt in Porter I rendered a final judgment upon the merits.\\n\\n       Without running afoul of the doctrine of res judicata, there is no question that the plaintiff\\n\\nmay advance any retaliation claims which arose from events subsequent to the Court\\'s judgment\\n\\nin Porter I, so long as those claims were not covered by the factual allegations upon which the\\n\\njudgment was based. See Joshi v. Prof\\'l Health Servs., Inc., 817 F.2d 877, 880-81 (D.C. Cir.\\n\\n1987). But that is not what the plaintiff attempts to do here. Rather, the plaintiff now contends\\n\\nthat the Agency committed acts of discrimination and retaliation against him during the\\n\\npendency of Porter I, which include the same acts which served as the basis for the plaintiff\\'s\\n\\npost-judgment motion in Porter I alleging that the Agency violated the Court\\'s order enjoining it\\n\\nfrom further retaliation against the plaintiff. Pl.\\'s Show Cause Mem. at 1-2, Porter I (D.D.C.\\n\\nJune 24, 2003). In those post-judgment proceedings the parties briefed for the Court and\\n\\nlitigated whether the Agency\\'s acts of (1) denying the plaintiff a 2001 bonus and (2) providing\\n\\nhim with a 2002 \"Needs Improvement\" assessment constituted retaliation. Compare id. at 2,\\n\\nwith Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-53. The question therefore becomes whether the Court\\'s post-\\n\\njudgment orders amounted to a final judgment on these issues.\\n\\n       Part of the relief that the plaintiff sought in Porter I included injunctive relief forbidding\\n\\nthe Agency from retaliating against him. Judgment at 2, Porter I (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2003);\\n\\nMemorandum at 1-2, Porter I (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2003). The Court awarded the plaintiff this relief\\n\\nfollowing a favorable jury verdict on two counts of his complaint. Judgment at 2, Porter I\\n\\n(D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2003). Seeking to enforce this injunctive relief, the plaintiff fully briefed and\\n\\noffered documentary evidence to support his allegations that the Agency retaliated against him\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 13\\n\\x0cwhen it denied him a 2001 performance bonus and gave him a \"Needs Improvement\"\\n\\nperformance rating for 2002. Pl.\\'s Show Cause Mem. at 1-2, Porter I (D.D.C. June 24, 2003).\\n\\nThe Agency opposed the motion and offered voluminous evidentiary support of its own position.\\n\\nSee Defendant\\'s Response to Order to Show Cause at 1, Porter I (D.D.C. Sept. 5, 2003). Upon\\n\\nconsidering both parties\\' evidence, the Court discharged the plaintiff\\'s show cause motion on the\\n\\ngrounds that his allegations did not meet the legal standard necessary to establish a retaliation\\n\\nclaim. Memorandum & Order \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, Porter I (D.D.C. Nov. 25, 2003); see also Order at 1-2,\\n\\nPorter I (D.D.C. May 25, 2005). The Court also denied the plaintiff\\'s request to conduct\\n\\nadditional discovery concerning the alleged retaliation. Id. Specifically, that member of this\\n\\nCourt stated:\\n\\n                I find no evidence of contempt in the record before me. [The\\n                plaintiff] was not entitled to a performance award for 2001 when\\n                only 35% of those eligible were given such awards (and when 17\\n                of 25 employees who had received \"excellent\" performance ratings\\n                did not receive awards). Nor was he entitled to an \"excellent\"\\n                performance rating in 2002, from a new supervisor, working in a\\n                changed organization, especially when he \"actively and\\n                deliberatively avoided supervisory feedback.\"\\n\\nMemorandum & Order \u00b6 2, Porter I (D.D.C. Nov. 25, 2003). In a second order, which addressed\\n\\nthe plaintiff\\'s request for permission to conduct discovery regarding the alleged retaliation, the\\n\\nsame member of this Court reiterated:\\n\\n                The most startling assertion of the motion \u2013 that \"Barbara Turner\\n                has brazenly approached Agency employees in an attempt to\\n                obtain information that Ms. Turner could \u2013 as described in her own\\n                words \u2013 \\'use against\\' Mr. Porter,\" . . . turns out to be supported\\n                only by Mr. Porter\\'s declaration about something said to him about\\n                something Ms. Turner allegedly said nearly two years ago. What\\n                Mr. Porter calls \"fresh evidence of the Agency\\'s retaliatory\\n                motivations and actions,\" . . . is also uncorroborated hearsay . . .\\n                The injunction [prohibiting the Agency from retaliating against the\\n                plaintiff] does not make [the plaintiff\\'s] position a sinecure, or\\n\\n                                                 14\\n\\x0c                 guarantee that he will receive superior performance evaluations or\\n                 promotions, or forbid anyone to say anything negative about him.\\n\\nOrder at 1-2, Porter I (D.D.C. May 25, 2005).\\n\\n        Therefore, after having reviewed the record and the docket entries of the previous lawsuit\\n\\nbrought by this plaintiff, this Court is convinced that the plaintiff received the equivalent of a\\n\\nfinal judgment on the merits of his retaliation claims concerning the 2001 bonus and his 2002\\n\\nperformance review. The record in Porter I reflects that the parties fully briefed and provided\\n\\nevidentiary support on the issue of whether those acts constituted retaliation, and a member of\\n\\nthis Court weighed the factual evidence proffered and rendered a judgment on the merits of those\\n\\nmatters. The plaintiff having been afforded the opportunity to litigate his retaliations claims as to\\n\\nthe 2001 bonus and 2002 performance evaluation on the merits in his 2000 lawsuit against the\\n\\ndefendant, and having received the equivalent of a final judgment on the merits rendered by a\\n\\ncourt of competent jurisdiction on these same claims he seeks to pursue in this case, the Court\\n\\nfinds that Counts VIII and X are barred by the doctrine of res judicata. 8 However, because the\\n\\nplaintiff has not yet had the opportunity to pursue his claims of retaliation as to the later\\n\\nperformance assessments \u2013 his 2003 mid-year performance assessment as alleged in Count XII,\\n\\nand his 2004 interim performance assessment as alleged in Count XIV \u2013 the Court cannot find\\n\\nthat those claims are barred by res judicata.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n         The plaintiff had his one bite of the apple as to these claims. The plaintiff\\'s only avenue for relief\\nas to the Court\\'s discharge of his show cause motion was to appeal, just as the plaintiff appealed other\\npost-judgment orders in his earlier case. See Notice of Appeal, Porter I (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 2004). The\\nplaintiff does not get to re-assert his claims in a second lawsuit simply because he disagrees with the\\nCourt\\'s finding that those acts did not amount to retaliation.\\n\\n\\n                                                      15\\n\\x0cC.     Discrimination Based on Race and Gender\\n\\n       Title VII provides that \u201cpersonnel actions affecting employees . . . in executive agencies\\n\\n. . . shall be made free from any discrimination based on race . . . [or] sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\\n\\n16(a). It also provides:\\n\\n               It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to\\n               discriminate against any of his employees . . . because [the\\n               employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful\\n               employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a\\n               charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an\\n               investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\\n\\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).\\n\\n       Title VII is not absolute, however. The Supreme Court has stated:\\n\\n               Congress did not intend by Title VII, however, to guarantee a job\\n               to every person regardless of qualifications. In short, the Act does\\n               not command that any person be hired simply because he was\\n               formerly the subject of discrimination, or because he is a member\\n               of a minority group. Discriminatory preference for any group,\\n               minority or majority, is precisely and only what Congress has\\n               proscribed.\\n\\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

However, where the plaintiff, as here, claims that his federal employer failed to promote him,\\n\\nthe McDonnell Douglas test has been modified to require that\\n\\n               to make out a prima facie case the plaintiff must show that [he]\\n               belongs to a protected group, that [he] was qualified for and\\n               applied for a promotion, that [he] was considered for and denied\\n               the promotion, and that other employees of similar qualifications\\n               who were not members of the protected group were indeed\\n               promoted at the time the plaintiff\\'s request for promotion was\\n               denied.\\n\\nBundy v. Jackson, 641 F.2d 934, 951 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (citation omitted).\\n\\n       \"If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the\\n\\ndefendant employer to produce evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or someone else was\\n\\npreferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.\" Jackson v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 703, 707\\n\\n(D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Reeves, 530 U.S. at 142 (internal quotation marks omitted)). Once\\n\\n\"the employer offers a non-discriminatory justification for its actions, the McDonnell Douglas\\n\\nframework falls away,\" Vickers v. Powell, 493 F.3d 186, 195 (D.C. Cir. 2007), and the burden\\n\\nshifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer\\'s proffered reason is merely \"pretextual,\"\\n\\nand designed to \"shield[] discriminatory motives,\" Jackson, 496 F.3d at 707 (citing Murray v.\\n\\nGilmore, 406 F.3d 708, 713 (D.C.

Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 259 (1981). Thus, \"[i]n order to justify an\\n\\ninference of discrimination, the qualifications gap [between the candidates] must be great enough\\n\\nto be inherently indicative of discrimination,\" i.e., there must be \"a \\'wide and inexplicable gulf\\'\\n\\nbetween candidates.\" Holcomb, 433 F.3d at 897 (quoting Lathram v.

So, when the qualifications are close, the Court must give the Agency the\\n\\nbenefit of the doubt as to its choice among similarly qualified candidates. Id. (\"\\'In a close case, a\\n\\nreasonable juror would usually assume that the employer is more capable of assessing the\\n\\nsignificance of small differences in the qualifications of the candidates, or that the employer\\n\\nsimply made a judgment call.\\'\") (quoting Aka v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1294 (D.C.\\n\\nCir. 1998) (en banc)).\\n\\n        Here, the plaintiff, an African-American male, alleges that the defendant committed three\\n\\nacts of discrimination: (1) \"by denying him a promotion on the basis of his race to the position of\\n\\nGS-15 Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist,\" Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 30 (Count I); (2) \"by\\n\\ndenying him a promotion on the basis of his race to the position of GS-15 Administrative Officer\\n\\nwithin the Agency\\'s Global Bureau,\" id. \u00b6 35 (Count III); and (3) \"by denying him a promotion\\n\\non the basis of his gender . . . to the position of GS-15 Deputy Chief within the Agency\\'s\\n\\nPersonnel Operations Division,\" id. \u00b6 40 (Count V, as amended by the plaintiff\\'s consent to\\n\\npartial summary judgment, see Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 2). The Court will address each non-selection in\\n\\nturn.\\n\\n        1.     The Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist Position\\n\\n        In Count I of his second amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges several days after he\\n\\ninitiated Porter I, he applied for a GS-15 grade level Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist\\n\\nposition. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 15. The plaintiff was not interviewed for the position, and he\\n\\nmaintains that the Agency discriminated against him when it filled the position with another\\n\\ncandidate, a Caucasian male, who the plaintiff alleges was not as qualified as he was for the\\n\\nposition. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. The plaintiff maintains that when the selection decision was made he had\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 19\\n\\x0cmore \"management experience,\" \"extensive supervisory training,\" and more experience working\\n\\nwithin the Agency than did the successful candidate. Id. \u00b6 17.\\n\\n       The defendant contends that the plaintiff cannot maintain a Title VII discrimination claim\\n\\nas to the Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist position because he cannot demonstrate that he\\n\\nwas better qualified for the position that required \"[k]nowledge of the laws, regulations, theories,\\n\\nprinciples, practices, and techniques of employee and labor relations,\" \"discussions and\\n\\nnegotiations with unions,\" and \"represent[ation of] the Agency in negotiations and before\\n\\nadministrative tribunals and to draft legal documents,\" skills possessed by the attorney who was\\n\\nultimately selected. Def.\\'s Mem. at 14-15 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Pl.\\'s Facts\\n\\nStatement, Ex. 61 (U.S. Agency for International Development Vacancy Announcement\\n\\n(\"Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist Vacancy Announcement\")) at 1. The defendant\\n\\ntherefore maintains that the successful candidate was \"significantly better qualified than [the\\n\\nplaintiff]\" because the plaintiff, while experienced within the Agency and possessing supervisory\\n\\nexperience, \"was involved with negotiating only one contract or agreement during his career,\"\\n\\n\"wrote only one appeal, . . . ha[d] never written a final agency decision during his career\" or \"an\\n\\nagency-level Foreign Service decision,\" and had never \"appeared before the Foreign Service\\n\\nGrievance Board,\" all which were relevant qualifications for the position and expected tasks of\\n\\nthe person selected for the position. Def.\\'s Mem. at 15-16.\\n\\n       As to his claim of racial discrimination related to the Supervisory Labor Relations\\n\\nSpecialist position, the plaintiff has established \"that [he] belongs to a protected group, [a racial\\n\\nminority,] that [he] . . . applied for a promotion, . . . and that [another] employee[] of similar\\n\\nqualifications who w[as] not [a] member[] of the protected group w[as] indeed promoted at the\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  20\\n\\x0ctime the plaintiff\\'s request for promotion was denied.\" Bundy, 641 F.2d at 951 (citation\\n\\nomitted). The remaining factors that the plaintiff must also establish to make out a prima facie\\n\\ncase are \"that []he was qualified for . . . [and] considered for . . . the promotion.\" Id.\\n\\n        It is questionable whether the plaintiff has shown that he was qualified for the position.\\n\\nWhile the plaintiff has an extensive professional background, including supervisory experience\\n\\nand educational training in business administration, Pl.\\'s Facts Statement, Ex. 2 (Resume of\\n\\nMelvin C. Porter), which are some of the qualifications that the Agency desired for the\\n\\nSupervisory Labor Relations Specialist position, and while the position did not require that the\\n\\ncandidate have a law degree, Pl.\\'s Facts Statement, Ex. 61 (Supervisory Labor Relations\\n\\nSpecialist Vacancy Announcement), many of the job functions of the position identified in the\\n\\nvacancy announcement involve law related tasks, skills which the plaintiff had little or no\\n\\nexperience performing, id. However, despite the fact that the job description sought a candidate\\n\\nwith some skills the plaintiff did not possess, the Court is sensitive to the minimal threshold a\\n\\nplaintiff must satisfy to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, and will therefore assume\\n\\nthat the plaintiff has met that threshold. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253 (\u201cThe burden of establishing a\\n\\nprima facie case of disparate treatment is not onerous.\u201d).\\n\\n        The plaintiff having established his prima facie case, the Court must consider next the\\n\\nAgency\\'s proffered reason why it hired a Caucasian candidate rather than the plaintiff. The\\n\\nAgency asserts that it made its selection because the selectee was an attorney who \"had practiced\\n\\nlaw for approximately ten years prior to his selection for the [position],\" held a law degree from\\n\\na prestigious law school, Def.\\'s Mem. at 15, and had experience performing legally related\\n\\nfunctions required of the position, see Pl.\\'s Facts Statement, Ex. 61 (Supervisory Labor Relations\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  21\\n\\x0cSpecialist Vacancy Announcement). As to why the Agency did not select the plaintiff, it asserts\\n\\nthat the plaintiff did not have a legal degree, had drafted only one appeal, never prepared a final\\n\\nagency decision during his career or wrote an agency-level Foreign Service decision, and had\\n\\nnever represented the Agency before the Foreign Service Grievance Board, all tasks which he\\n\\nwould be required to do if he had been selected for the position. Def.\\'s Mem. at 15-16. In short,\\n\\nthe Agency represents that it hired the other candidate because he had more experience doing the\\n\\ntype of work called for by the position. Id. The Court finds this explanation qualifies as a\\n\\nlawful, nondiscriminatory rationale for the Agency\\'s decision not to select the plaintiff.\\n\\n        The burden therefore shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the Agency\\'s\\n\\nrationale for its decision was a mere pretext, concealing a true discriminatory motive, Jackson,\\n\\n496 F.3d at 707, which the plaintiff has not satisfied. In his attempt to meet this burden, the\\n\\nplaintiff contends that the vacancy announcement was drafted in a manner that deliberately\\n\\n\"disadvantage[d]\" him, because before it was revised, a previous version of the announcement\\n\\nhad a greater focus on supervisory skill, 10 and the Agency \"selected a candidate with little to no\\n\\nsupervisory experience for a supervisory position.\" Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 54. The evidence in the record\\n\\nsimply does not demonstrate that the plaintiff\\'s experience rendered him better qualified than the\\n\\ncandidate hired by the Agency, or that the Agency\\'s vacancy announcement for the position\\n\\nmisrepresented the skills actually required of the position. The position required that the selectee\\n\\n\\n10\\n        The plaintiff makes a great deal about the title of the position, including the descriptive term\\n\"Supervisory,\" which in the plaintiff\\'s view indicates greater need for supervisory skills over other skills.\\nPl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 56. But, as the description for the position explains, the Agency was also looking for more\\nthan just a supervisor in filling the position, see Pl.\\'s Facts Statement, Ex. 61 (Supervisory Labor\\nRelations Specialist Vacancy Announcement), as it was looking for someone to manage labor relations;\\nthe same rationale it gave for selecting the candidate it choose. Def.\\'s Mem. at 15-16. The Court\\ntherefore cannot find that the position\\'s title was determinative of the type of skills that the Agency\\nneeded and gives rise to an inference of impropriety as the plaintiff urges.\\n\\n                                                     22\\n\\x0cpossess the \u201c[a]bility to effectively communicate orally and interact with coworkers,\u201d\\n\\n\u201ceffectively communicate in writing,\u201d \u201ceffectively meet and deal with others,\u201d \u201c[have]\\n\\n[k]nowledge of the laws, regulations, theories, principles, practices, and techniques of employee\\n\\nand labor relations,\u201d and \u201cnegotiate within the collective bargaining process.\u201d Def.\\'s Mem., Ex.\\n\\n6 (Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist Vacancy Notice) at 2; see also Def.\\'s Mem., Ex. 29\\n\\n(Supervisory Recertification). These skills were required because the selectee would serve as an\\n\\nadvisor in regards to the Agency\\'s labor management obligation, \"[c]onduct[] discussions and\\n\\nnegotiations with unions representing Agency employees and prepare[] agreements, . . .\\n\\n[r]epresent[] the Agency before the Federal Labor Relations Authority [and] the Foreign Service\\n\\nLabor Relations Board, . . . [and] [r]ender final Agency decisions.\" Def.\\'s Mem., Ex. 6\\n\\n(Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist Vacancy Notice) at 1; see also Def.\\'s Mem., Ex. 29\\n\\n(Supervisory Recertification). It is no wonder then that the Agency hired someone with more\\n\\nlabor relations and legal experience than the plaintiff, who is not an attorney and had little to no\\n\\nexperience in these areas. See Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 59. In essence, there was no \"\\'wide and inexplicable\\n\\ngulf\\' between [the] candidates\" favoring the plaintiff. See Holcomb, 433 F.3d at 897 (citation\\n\\nomitted). The Court therefore has no basis to infer that the Agency\\'s reasoning for the plaintiff\\'s\\n\\nnon-selection was a pretext for an improper discriminatory motive.\\n\\n       The plaintiff also argues that the Agency\\'s selecting official, Marilyn Marton, \"exercised\\n\\nher unlawful animus towards\" him through his non-selection. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 54-55. Yet, the\\n\\nplaintiff offers no evidence from which the Court can find that his claim can survive summary\\n\\njudgment on that basis. Specifically, the plaintiff has not shown how it can be inferred that his\\n\\nrace played any role in the Agency\\'s decision. Simply, the plaintiff has shown nothing more than\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 23\\n\\x0cwhen the Agency made its selection for the Supervisory Labor Relations position that it\\n\\nexercised its \"discretion to choose among [presumably] equally qualified candidates,\" which it is\\n\\nlawfully permitted to do. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 259. Therefore, having failed to meet his burden\\n\\nof demonstrating that the Agency\\'s selection of another candidate for the Supervisory Labor\\n\\nRelations Specialist position was discriminatory based on his race, the Court will award\\n\\nsummary judgment to the Agency on Count I of the plaintiff\\'s second amended complaint.\\n\\n        2.      The Administrative Officer Position\\n\\n        In Count III of his second amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges that in 2001, while\\n\\nPorter I was still pending, the Agency laterally transferred a Caucasian into the role of a GS-15\\n\\ngrade level Administrative Officer, a position for which the plaintiff alleges that he was more\\n\\nqualified. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. The Agency did not open the position to competition,\\n\\nid. \u00b6 19, and the plaintiff contends that because he never \"ha[d] [the] opportunity to express his\\n\\ninterest in [that] position\" or compete for it, although he was qualified, that the lateral transfer\\n\\nwas \"illicit\" and amounted to racial discrimination against him. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 63.\\n\\n        The Agency maintains that it made the transfer because the individual who was\\n\\nreassigned was \"\\'absolutely outstanding\\'\" based on \"\\'the quality of his thinking, how articulate he\\n\\nwas, how broad based [he was] in his thinking, . . . [as a] teacher and mentor . . . to the staff,\\'\"\\n\\nand he had a \"long and distinguished career in the personnel field,\" including his publications\\n\\nand \"college-level teaching experience,\" qualifications which the plaintiff did not possess. Def.\\'s\\n\\nMem. at 13-14 (citation omitted).\\n\\n        As to proving his prima facie claim of racial discrimination with respect to the\\n\\nAdministrative Officer position, the plaintiff has established that he is a member of a racial\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  24\\n\\x0cminority, a protected group, who desired a job that the Agency filled through the lateral transfer\\n\\nof another individual without utilizing the competitive process, which would have allowed him\\n\\nto compete for the position. While there is a question whether this position amounted to a\\n\\n\"promotion\" for the candidate selected for the position, see Bundy, 641 F.2d at 951 (requiring\\n\\nthat the plaintiff show \"that other employees of similar qualifications who were not members of\\n\\nthe protected group were indeed promoted at the time the plaintiff\\'s request for promotion was\\n\\ndenied\" (emphasis added) (citation omitted)), the Court will presume that the plaintiff has\\n\\nshouldered his burden of establishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination as to the\\n\\nAdministrative Officer position. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.\\n\\n        The Court must next examine the Agency\\'s proffered rationale for why it made the\\n\\nselection decision it did. As noted, the Agency maintains that its transfer decision was based on\\n\\nthe selectee\\'s \"\\'absolutely outstanding\\'\" credentials, including a \"long and distinguished career in\\n\\nthe personnel field,\" his publications, and \"college-level teaching experience.\" Def.\\'s Mem. at\\n\\n13-14. The Agency also points to the fact that the transferee was already a grade level higher\\n\\nthan the plaintiff when the transfer into the Administrative Officer position was made, making it\\n\\na lateral transfer. Id. at 13. In essence, the Agency argues that no one was denied a promotion.\\n\\nThe Court finds that the Agency\\'s explanation amounts to a legitimate, non-discriminatory\\n\\nrationale for its decision.\\n\\n        In response, the plaintiff represents he was better qualified for the position than the\\n\\ntransferred candidate based on his \"six (6) years of experience as an Administrative Officer at the\\n\\nGS-14 grade level,\" Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 20, and \"the GS-15 Administrative Officer position\\n\\nwas a natural progression for a veteran GS-14 Administrative Officer such as [he was],\" Pl.\\'s\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 25\\n\\x0cOpp\\'n at 65. These unsupported self-serving allegations alone are insufficient to carry the\\n\\nplaintiff\\'s burden of showing that the Agency\\'s decision was a pretext for racial discrimination.\\n\\nThe transferred candidate had served at GS-15 grade level for longer than the plaintiff had even\\n\\nbeen assigned to the Global Bureau. Def.\\'s Mem. at 13 (citing Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 20). The\\n\\nplaintiff\\'s greater experience serving as an Administrative Officer at a lower grade level than the\\n\\ntransferred candidate is inadequate to demonstrate that the Agency concealed its true motive of\\n\\nmaking its decision not to open the position up to a competitive selection process based on the\\n\\nracial animus against him. The Agency was permitted to laterally transfer an employee pursuant\\n\\nto its internal policy 11 and the plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence to disturb the apparent\\n\\npropriety of that decision.\\n\\n       Accordingly, because the plaintiff has not rebutted the Agency\\'s proffered legitimate,\\n\\nnon-discriminatory reason for its decision based on the evidence in the record, the Court must\\n\\naward summary judgment to the defendant on Count III of the amended complaint.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n        The Agency policy is called the Automated Directives System (\"ADS\"). Def.\\'s Mem. at 10 n.3.\\nIn 2001, the ADS provided in pertinent part:\\n\\n               Competition under the Merit Promotion procedures is not required for\\n               the following actions:\\n                                                    ...\\n               g) Promotion, reassignment, demotion, transfer, reinstatement, or detail\\n               to a position having promotion potential no greater than the potential of a\\n               position an employee currently holds or previously held on a permanent\\n               basis in the competitive service (or in another merit system with which\\n               OPM has an approved interchange agreement and which the employee\\n               did not lose because of performance or conduct reasons . . . .\\n\\nDef.\u2019s Mem., Ex. 19 (ADS \u00a7 418.5.8(g) (2001)).\\n\\n\\n                                                   26\\n\\x0c        3.      The Deputy Chief Position\\n\\n        In the remaining portion of the plaintiff\\'s second amended complaint, which addresses a\\n\\nposition for which the plaintiff was not selected (Count V), 12 he alleges that in 2001, while\\n\\nPorter I was still pending, he was an unsuccessful candidate for a GS-15 grade level Deputy\\n\\nChief position in the Personnel Operations Division. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 21. Here, the\\n\\nplaintiff contends that he was not selected because the Agency discriminated against him based\\n\\non his gender and chose an allegedly unqualified African-American female instead. Id. The\\n\\nplaintiff alleges that not only was he more qualified than the selectee, but that the individual\\n\\nselected did not possess the minimum qualifications for the position, i.e., a bachelor\\'s degree.\\n\\nPl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 61. He alleges that his supervisor, who did not select him earlier for the\\n\\nSupervisory Labor Relations Specialist position and had demonstrated \"unlawful animus\" against\\n\\nhim, id. at 55, \"influenced\" the selection decision for the Deputy Chief position, id. at 60.\\n\\n        The Agency contends that the plaintiff cannot maintain a Title VII discrimination claim\\n\\nas to the Deputy Chief position because the candidate hired was better qualified due to her\\n\\n\"knowledge, skills, . . . abilities,\" and \"leadership abilities.\" Def.\\'s Mem. at 17-19. The Agency\\n\\nmaintains that the candidate who was selected for the position had \"over 34 years of experience\\n\\nin human resource management,\" had been \"acting in a position very similar to the [Deputy\\n\\nChief] position at issue,\" supervised three-to-four times the number of employees that the\\n\\nplaintiff supervised at any given time, was the plaintiff\\'s supervisor for up to two years, and\\n\\n\"\\'demonstrated broader knowledge in both civil service and foreign service personnel operations\\n\\nand related rules, regulations and procedures which is critical to the functioning of the position\\'\"\\n\\n12\\n       As the Court has already noted, the plaintiff does not contest the defendant\\'s motion for summary\\njudgment as it relates to the portion of Count V, which alleges racial discrimination. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 2.\\n\\n\\n                                                   27\\n\\x0cthan did the plaintiff during the interviews for the position. Id. at 18-19 (citation omitted). The\\n\\nAgency further contends that because \"[it] applied the same standards to each applicant, using\\n\\nthe same interview panel and questions,\" it was \"unlikely\" than any discrimination occurred. Id.\\n\\nat 19.\\n\\n         As to this gender discrimination claim, the plaintiff again has the initial burden of\\n\\nproving by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. Concerning\\n\\nthis burden, the plaintiff has established that he applied for a promotion for which he was not\\n\\nselected. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 60. Yet, in this case, more is required. Where a male plaintiff claims\\n\\ngender discrimination, the traditional McDonnell Douglas test is applied differently because\\n\\n\"\\'there is nothing inherently suspicious\\'\" about an employer\\'s decision to promote a qualified\\n\\nminority applicant, in this case, a woman. Mastro v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., 447 F.3d 843,\\n\\n851 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Harding v. Gray, 9 F.3d 150, 153 (D.C. Cir. 1993)); see also\\n\\nHamilton v. Paulson, 542 F. Supp. 2d 37, 43 n.6 (D.D.C. 2008) (stating that \"reverse\\n\\ndiscrimination\" analysis applies where a male claims a violation of Title VII\\'s protection against\\n\\ngender discrimination). Thus, \"a majority-group plaintiff alleging Title VII discrimination must\\n\\nshow \\'additional background circumstances that support the suspicion that the defendant is that\\n\\nunusual employer who discriminates against the majority.\\'\" Mastro, 447 F.3d at 851 (quoting\\n\\nParker v.

Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973))). The plaintiff simply has offered\\n\\nno evidence that the Agency is the type of employer who traditionally discriminates against men.\\n\\nAnd, even assuming the plaintiff could meet his burden to establish institutional male\\n\\ndiscrimination, i.e. his burden of proving a prima facie case, he also has not put forth enough\\n\\nevidence to rebut the Agency\\'s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory rationale for selecting the\\n\\ncandidate who was chosen for the position. And here, the Agency has articulated a legitimate,\\n\\nnon-discriminatory explanation for its decision, having stated that the female selected had \"over\\n\\n34 years of experience in human resource management,\" had been serving in a similar position to\\n\\nthat of Deputy Chief, and had far more supervisory experience than that of the plaintiff, even\\n\\nhaving supervised the plaintiff for some time. Def.\\'s Mem. at 18-19.\\n\\n       Regarding the plaintiff\\'s attempt to rebut the Agency\\'s explanation for its selection\\n\\ndecision, the only aspects of the plaintiff\\'s candidacy that he identifies as exceeding those of the\\n\\nselectee include his educational credentials and two years of \"classification experience.\" Pl.\\'s\\n\\nOpp\\'n at 61. Indeed, the plaintiff makes a great fuss over the fact that the selectee does not have\\n\\na college degree, whereas he holds three degrees. Id. The plaintiff points out, and it is\\n\\nuncontested, that the job description for the Deputy Chief position states, under the category of\\n\\neducation, that a \"B.A.\/B.S. in personnel management, business administration or international\\n\\nbusiness management is required[,] [and a] M.A.\/M.S. is desired.\" Def.\\'s Mem., Ex. 32\\n\\n(Position Description) at 6; see Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 61. The plaintiff glosses over the fact that, by the\\n\\nplain text of the description, neither he nor the hired candidate fulfills this criterion. While the\\n\\nplaintiff holds two \"desired\" master\\'s degrees, his bachelor\\'s degree was in political science, Pl.\\'s\\n\\nFacts Statement, Ex. 2 (Resume of Melvin C. Porter) at 1 (emphasis added), not \"personnel\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  29\\n\\x0cmanagement, business administration or international business management,\" Def.\\'s Mem., Ex.\\n\\n32. Therefore, the Court finds that the plaintiff merely exceeded the hired candidate in an area\\n\\nwhere neither candidate satisfied one of the actual designated qualification factors. And, in the\\n\\nabsence of any suggestion that the Agency rendered its selection decision based on\\n\\nimpermissible discrimination and \"given the dynamic nature of the hiring process,\" this Court\\n\\nwill not \"second-guess how an employer weighs particular factors in the hiring decision.\"\\n\\nJackson, 496 F.3d at 709; see id. (\"\\'employers are not rigidly bound by the language in a job\\n\\ndescription\\'; employer\\'s \\'decision to weigh administrative\/managerial experience more heavily\\n\\nthan the job description suggested [was] simply not sufficient to demonstrate\\' falsity of\\n\\nemployer\\'s qualifications-based explanation\" (quoting Browning v. Dep\\'t of Army, 436 F.3d 692,\\n\\n696-97 (6th Cir. 2006))); see also Lee v. GTE Fla., Inc., 226 F.3d 1249, 1255 n.2 (11th Cir.\\n\\n2000), quoted in Jackson, 496 F.3d at 709 (\"evidence that employer \\'changed the importance of\\n\\nthe criteria he used in the selection process\\' did not tend to show that employer\\'s asserted\\n\\nnondiscriminatory explanation was false.\"). Similarly, the Court cannot find that the plaintiff\\'s\\n\\ntwo years of classification experience are determinative of him being the significantly more\\n\\nqualified candidate because that experience occurred fifteen years earlier during his tenure with\\n\\nanother agency. See Pl.\\'s Facts Statement, Ex. 2 (Resume of Melvin C. Porter) at 3.\\n\\n       Here, where the Agency insists that the criterion of education and classification\\n\\nexperience alone were not determinative of its ultimate selection decision, but rather it weighed\\n\\nthe \"relative qualifications of the candidates, \\'[this Court] must assume that a reasonable juror\\n\\nwho might disagree with the employer\\'s decision[s], but would find the question close, would not\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 30\\n\\x0cusually infer discrimination on the basis of a comparison of qualifications alone.\\'\" Jackson, 496\\n\\nF.3d at 707 (quoting Aka v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1294 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc)).\\n\\n        Despite the plaintiff\\'s argument to the contrary, the question of the two candidates\\'\\n\\nqualifications is close. Therefore, it does not appear that the plaintiff was \"significantly better\\n\\nqualified for the job\" than was the successful candidate, see id. at 707, or even actually better\\n\\nqualified. The plaintiff has not countered the Agency\\'s identification of numerous weaknesses in\\n\\nhis own credentials, or cast doubt upon the proffered strengths of the successful candidate\\'s\\n\\ncredentials. The Agency maintains that the African-American female who was selected \"had, as\\n\\nof July 3, 2001, over 34 years of experience in human resource management regarding the civil\\n\\nservice rules and regulations,\" Def.\\'s Mem. at 18, while the plaintiff had roughly half that level\\n\\nof experience, Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 8. The Agency also maintains that the successful candidate\\n\\nhad been with the Agency longer than the plaintiff, had experience \"acting in a position very\\n\\nsimilar to the . . . deputy position at issue in this case\" for over a decade, had supervised up to\\n\\ntwenty-five employees as compared to the plaintiff\\'s supervision of nine employees, and, in fact,\\n\\nhad been the plaintiff\\'s supervisor for almost two years. Def.\\'s Mem. at 18-19. Moreover, the\\n\\nAgency represents that \"[during the successful candidate\\'s] tenure at [the Agency], [her] various\\n\\npositions . . . included [four years as] Chief of the Staffing Branch . . . and [three years as a]\\n\\nSenior Policy Analyst.\" Id. at 18. In comparison, during his tenure with the Agency, and prior\\n\\nto his current Administrative Officer position, the plaintiff had been a Supervisory Personnel\\n\\nManagement Specialist for three years, a non-consecutive tenure of approximately two years as\\n\\nthe Deputy Chief of the Recruitment Division, and Acting Chief of the Recruitment Division for\\n\\nten months. Pl.\\'s Facts Statement, Ex. 2 (Resume of Melvin C. Porter) at 2. On this record, the\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  31\\n\\x0cplaintiff has not demonstrated a marked difference between his and the successful candidate\\'s\\n\\nsupervisory and management experience.\\n\\n       Further, the Agency states that the successful candidate had \"developed personnel-related\\n\\npolicies\" in several areas, and \"performed better in the interview than [the plaintiff] because her\\n\\nresponses to questions \\'demonstrated broader knowledge in both civil service and foreign service\\n\\npersonnel operations and related rules, regulations and procedures which is critical to the\\n\\nfunction of the position [for which she was ultimately selected].\\'\" Def.\\'s Mem. at 18 (citation\\n\\nomitted). The Agency adds, and the plaintiff has not shown otherwise, that all the candidates for\\n\\nthe Deputy Chief position were held to \"the same standards . . . using the same interview panel\\n\\nand questions,\" and the candidate ultimately selected was chosen based on \"her skills and\\n\\nabilities, her outstanding performance, her unparalleled institutional knowledge, and because,\\n\\nunlike [the plaintiff], she had held a similar position before and more recently had been acting in\\n\\nthe position on a temporary basis.\" Id. at 19. Indeed, the sum total of the evidence that the\\n\\nplaintiff has offered in his attempt to rebut the Agency\\'s representations concerning why he was\\n\\nnot selected are the three degrees he has acquired, whereas the successful candidate had no\\n\\ndegree, and his two \"years of position classification experience, [while the person selected had\\n\\nnone,] . . . [noting that he had] served as Chief of the Classification Branch for [another\\n\\ngovernment agency,] the Small Business Administration[,]\" roughly fifteen years earlier. Pl.\\'s\\n\\nOpp\\'n at 61; Pl.\\'s Facts Statement, Ex. 2 (Resume of Melvin C. Porter) at 3. The Court must\\n\\ndecline to second-guess the Agency\\'s business decisions upon a record such as the one before it,\\n\\nsee, e.g., Stewart v. Ashcroft, 352 F.3d 422, 429-30 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (rejecting the plaintiff\\'s\\n\\nargument that he was \"discernibly better\" qualified for a supervisory position because he had\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 32\\n\\x0cmany more years of litigation experience as an attorney than the successful candidate), and\\n\\ntherefore cannot conclude that the two factors advanced by the plaintiff made him significantly\\n\\nbetter qualified than the successful candidate.\\n\\n       Similarly, the Court cannot find that the Agency\\'s rationale for its selection decision was\\n\\na mere pretext for its true motive of gender discrimination. The plaintiff\\'s conclusory allegations\\n\\nto the contrary are alone simply too tenuous to raise a genuine issue of material fact that must be\\n\\npresented to a jury. Accordingly, the Court must award summary judgment to the Agency on the\\n\\ngender discrimination aspect of Count V of the plaintiff\\'s second amended complaint.\\n\\nD.     Retaliation\\n\\n       Just as with claims for illegal discrimination, the Court must employ the McDonnell\\n\\nDouglas burden-shifting test to the plaintiff\\'s claims for retaliation. Vickers, 493 F.3d at 194.\\n\\n\"To make out a prima facie case of illegal retaliation, [the plaintiff] must show that \\'(1) []he\\n\\nengaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) h[is] employer took an adverse personnel action\\n\\nagainst h[im]; and (3) a causal connection exists between the two\\'\" events. Id. at 195 (quoting\\n\\nCarney v. Am. Univ., 151 F.3d 1090, 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1998)). Because a causal connection is\\n\\noften hard to establish in the absence of any direct evidence of causation, to establish this\\n\\nelement of a retaliation claim a plaintiff may submit indirect evidence, including, for example,\\n\\nevidence of \"\\'very close\\'\" temporal proximity between the alleged act of retaliation and the\\n\\npurported protected activity. Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273-74 (2001)\\n\\n(citing various cases which conclude that a period of three-months or more, by itself, is\\n\\ninsufficient to establish the nexus).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  33\\n\\x0c        Further, for an act of alleged retaliation to be actionable, it must be an act that would\\n\\n\"\\'dissuade[] a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\\'\"\\n\\nBurlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006) (citation omitted). This\\n\\nreasonable person standard has been employed because \"[t]he anti-retaliation provision seeks to\\n\\nprevent employer interference with \\'unfettered access\\' to Title VII\\'s remedial mechanisms . . . .\\n\\n[a]nd normally petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners will not create\\n\\nsuch deterrence.\" Id. (citation omitted). In other words, only a plaintiff\\'s claims that relate to\\n\\nAgency\\'s actions which are of the type \"likely \\'to deter victims of discrimination from\\n\\ncomplaining to the EEOC,\\' the courts, and their employers\" can survive summary judgment. Id.\\n\\n(citation omitted).\\n\\n        Just as with the application of the McDonnell Douglas test to discrimination claims based\\n\\non race and gender, once the plaintiff has made this prima facie showing of prohibited\\n\\nretaliation, the Agency must then proffer \"some legitimate, nondiscriminatory [i.e., non-\\n\\nretaliatory] reason\\' for its actions.\" Vickers, 493 F.3d at 195 (quoting McDonnell Douglas, 411\\n\\nU.S. at 802). Upon such a proffer from the Agency, the plaintiff must establish that the Agency\\'s\\n\\nreason \"is [a] mere pretext and thus a \\'coverup\\'\" for its true retaliatory motive. Id. (citing\\n\\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 805). \"In order to prove [that] the [Agency\\'s] explanations for\\n\\nalleged acts of . . . retaliation are pretextual, [the plaintiff] must show \\'both that the reason [the\\n\\nAgency provided] was false, and that . . . [retaliation] was the real reason [for the Agency\\'s\\n\\ndecision].\\'\" Weber v. Battista, 494 F.3d 179, 186 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                   34\\n\\x0c        The plaintiff has asserted five counts of retaliation that remain unresolved. 13 These\\n\\nclaims include his assertions that the defendant unlawfully retaliated against him (1) by \"denying\\n\\n[him a] promotion to the position of GS-15 Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist,\" Second Am.\\n\\nCompl. \u00b6 33 (Count II); (2) by \"denying [him a] promotion to the position of GS-15\\n\\nAdministrative Officer within the Agency\\'s Global Bureau,\" id. \u00b6 38 (Count IV); (3) by \"denying\\n\\n[him a] promotion to the position of GS-15 Deputy Chief within the Agency\\'s Personnel\\n\\nOperations Division,\" id. \u00b6 43 (Count VI); (4) by \"issuing [him] an adverse [mid-year]\\n\\nperformance assessment in July 2003,\" id. \u00b6 58 (Count XII); and (5) by \"issuing [him] an adverse\\n\\ninterim performance assessment in September 2004,\" id. \u00b6 63 (Count XIV). The plaintiff alleges\\n\\nthat the statutorily protected activity that preceded his retaliation claims was his first Title VII\\n\\nlawsuit, Porter I, Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 4-5, as well as his \"numerous administrative grievances and EEO\\n\\nclaims against the Agency\" that preceded the filing of that lawsuit, Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32,\\n\\n37, 42, 57, 62, and his EEO complaint filed after the resolution of his lawsuit in November 2002,\\n\\nPl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 32.\\n\\n        1.      The Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist Position\\n\\n        In Count II of his second amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges that on August 29,\\n\\n2000, the Agency retaliated against him because of his prior protected activity, the initiation of\\n\\nPorter I earlier that month, when it laterally transferred a Caucasian into the position of\\n\\nSupervisory Labor Relations Specialist. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 11. The plaintiff contends that the\\n\\n\"temporal proximity\" of his non-selection with the initiation of his lawsuit, both within the same\\n\\n13\\n         As explained above, the principle of res judicata prohibits the plaintiff from relitigating any\\nallegations of retaliation based on the defendant\\'s denial of a performance award to the plaintiff in 2001\\n(Count VIII), and the defendant\\'s issuance of an allegedly adverse performance assessment with respect to\\nthe plaintiff\\'s job performance for 2002 (Count X).\\n\\n\\n                                                   35\\n\\x0cmonth, raises a genuine issue of material fact as to this retaliation claim, precluding summary\\n\\njudgment for the defendant. Id. at 55-56.\\n\\n        The Agency responds that the plaintiff cannot maintain this claim for retaliation because\\n\\nits selection decision was made for a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason \u2013 because the successful\\n\\ncandidate\\'s skills were more commensurate with the position than were the plaintiff\\'s. Def.\\'s\\n\\nMem. at 14-15. In addition, the Agency maintains that because it held all candidates to the same\\n\\nstandards, any retaliation in the selection process was \"unlikely,\" as all candidates were impacted\\n\\nby the weight it attributed to the various skills in the same manner. Id. at 16. The Agency also\\n\\npoints to the fact that it revisited the vacancy announcement prior to the plaintiff having\\n\\nexpressed any interest in that position, so its revision of that announcement is immaterial and\\n\\ndoes not warrant any inference that the Agency acted with any specific animus toward the\\n\\nplaintiff. Id. at 17.\\n\\n        The plaintiff rejoins that the Agency\\'s actions demonstrate its pretexual motives because\\n\\n\"[he] was markedly better qualified than [the successful candidate] for the Supervisory Labor\\n\\nRelations position,\" Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 58, and \"the Agency violated established policies and\\n\\nprocedures[] to the benefit of [that candidate] and the detriment of [the plaintiff]\" by\\n\\ndeemphasizing supervisory skills when it revised the vacancy announcement, id. at 56.\\n\\nSpecifically, the plaintiff contends that the Agency deliberately revised the job description for\\n\\nthe position to exclude someone with his qualifications, and that \"[a] factfinder could conclude\\n\\nthat supervisory experience was not reflected\" in the job description \"to the detriment of [the\\n\\nplaintiff] who had vast supervisory experience.\"14 Id. at 56-58. The plaintiff also maintains that\\n\\n\\n14\\n        The plaintiff attempts to buttress his argument for why the successful candidate was less qualified\\nby quoting union representatives not employed by the Agency who had views on the successful\\n                                                                                          (continued . . . )\\n                                                    36\\n\\x0cthe Agency \"deliberately sought only non-status employees in order to avoid selecting [the\\n\\nplaintiff].\" Id. at 58.\\n\\n        Mindful of the fact that the prima facie showing of retaliation is not meant to be an\\n\\n\"onerous\" one, Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, the Court finds that the plaintiff\\'s allegations that he\\n\\napplied for but did not receive the Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist position within the\\n\\nsame month after he initiated Porter I satisfies the required showing of his participation in a\\n\\n\"statutorily protected activity,\" that he was the victim of \"an adverse personnel action,\" and that\\n\\n\"a causal connection\" exists between these two events, Vickers, 493 F.3d at 195 (internal\\n\\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Further, as with the plaintiff\\'s other non-selection\\n\\nretaliation claims (Counts IV and VI), this claim refers to alleged conduct, non-selection for a\\n\\nposition with a higher pay grade, which objectively is the type of action that would deter a\\n\\nreasonable employee from making a future discrimination claim. See Burlington, 548 U.S. at 68.\\n\\n        In addressing the plaintiff\\'s discrimination claim with respect to this position, the Court\\n\\nhas already set forth what it deems to be the Agency\\'s legitimate, non-retaliatory rationale for its\\n\\nselection of the successful Caucasian candidate for this position \u2013 the successful candidate had\\n\\nbetter tailored qualifications for the position. See Def.\\'s Mem. at 15-16. Specifically, the\\n\\nAgency states that it made its selection because the successful candidate was an attorney who\\n\\n\"had practiced law for approximately ten years prior to his selection for the [position],\" held a\\n\\nlaw degree from a prestigious law school, id. at 15, and had experience performing the legally\\n\\nrelated functions that comprise the duties of the position, see Pl.\\'s Facts Statement, Ex. 61\\n\\ncandidate\\'s qualifications. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 59-60. This proffer is highly irrelevant, as the plaintiff has not\\nexplained how their post hoc opinions are in any way germane to this lawsuit. Moreover, the plaintiff\\ndoes not explain how the bulk of what these individuals indicate would be admissible under the Federal\\nRules of Evidence.\\n\\n\\n                                                      37\\n\\x0c(Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist Vacancy Notice) at 1. On the other hand, the Agency\\n\\nmaintains that the plaintiff did not have a legal degree, had drafted only one appeal, never\\n\\nprepared a final agency decision during his career or drafted an agency-level Foreign Service\\n\\ndecision, and had never represented the Agency before the Foreign Service Grievance Board, all\\n\\ntasks which he would be required to perform if he had been selected for the position. Def.\\'s\\n\\nMem. at 15-16. Although the successful candidate may have had less supervisory experience\\n\\nand tenure at the Agency than the plaintiff, the Agency deemed those factors to be less\\n\\nimportant. Id. Based on the Agency\\'s proffered reason for the plaintiff\\'s non-selection, the\\n\\nburden shifts back to the plaintiff to show why the that reason was false and amounted to an\\n\\nattempt by the Agency to conceal its true retaliatory motivation. Weber, 494 F.3d at 186.\\n\\n       The plaintiff has failed to meet this burden, having neglected to show how the Agency\\'s\\n\\nproffered reason for its decision was falsely offered, and that it was designed to cloak its true\\n\\nretaliatory motive. Temporal proximity of the Agency\\'s selection decision and the plaintiff\\'s\\n\\nearlier lawsuit, while it supports the finding of a prima facie case, is not, without more, proof\\n\\nenough to show that the Agency acted with retaliatory intent. See Patterson v. Johnson, 505 F.3d\\n\\n1296, 1299-1301 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (finding that while temporal proximity \"could support a jury\\'s\\n\\nfinding of a causal link\" to support a prima facie case, the plaintiff ultimately failed to show that\\n\\nhis employer\\'s transfer decision was retaliatory). And, although the position\\'s description was\\n\\nrevised after it was initially issued, the evidence indicates that it was not the only position\\n\\ndescription revised at that time, Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 57; Ex. 62 (Undated E-mail from Michelle Walker\\n\\nto Diana Lopez and Robert Ward) (stating that the descriptions for \"both of the . . . jobs . . .\\n\\nneed[ed] [to be] adjusted\"), and the plaintiff acknowledges that he never expressed to the\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  38\\n\\x0cselecting official any interest in applying for the position prior to the revision, Def.\\'s Mem. at 17.\\n\\nAt bottom, the plaintiff has failed to supply the necessary evidence to permit the Court to make\\n\\nthe inferential leap between these revisions and his speculation that the Agency revised the\\n\\nSupervisory Labor Relations Specialist position description for the purpose of specifically\\n\\nretaliating against him.\\n\\n       The plaintiff has also put forth no evidence to cause the Court to question the Agency\\'s\\n\\ncontention that all candidates for the position were considered on the same basis as the plaintiff,\\n\\nsee Def.\\'s Mem. at 16, or that the explanation about the revised position description is designed\\n\\nto somehow conceal the true responsibilities of that position, which the plaintiff contends were\\n\\nprimarily supervisory, Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 56-57. Finally, as already discussed above in addressing the\\n\\nplaintiff\\'s discrimination claim as to the selection decision for the position, the plaintiff has\\n\\noffered insufficient evidence to demonstrate that he was significantly more qualified than the\\n\\nsuccessful candidate. Therefore, because the plaintiff has ultimately failed to create a reasonable\\n\\ninference that the Agency\\'s rationale that the successful candidate was better qualified for the job\\n\\nmasked its ulterior and nefarious retaliatory motive against the plaintiff, the Court must award\\n\\nsummary judgment to the Agency on Count II of the second amended complaint.\\n\\n       2.      The Administrative Officer Position\\n\\n       In Count IV of his second amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges that in May 2001, the\\n\\nAgency retaliated against him due to his participation in protected activity, again the litigation of\\n\\nPorter I, when it laterally transferred a Caucasian employee into the position of Administrative\\n\\nOfficer. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 11. The plaintiff alleges that the hiring official demonstrated \"unlawful\\n\\nanimus towards [him]\" by laterally transferring the other employee who was already in a GS-15\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  39\\n\\x0cgrade level position, instead of opening the position to the competitive process for a position that\\n\\nwas \"a natural progression for a veteran GS-14 Administrative Officer such as [himself].\" Pl.\\'s\\n\\nOpp\\'n at 62, 65.\\n\\n       The Agency contends that the plaintiff has not established his prima facie case and\\n\\ntherefore cannot maintain a Title VII retaliation claim as to his non-selection for the\\n\\nAdministrative Officer position because: (1) he cannot show that he was the victim of any\\n\\nadverse action considering that the Agency \"had discretion to laterally transfer [the Caucasian\\n\\nemployee] into any open position at the same grade level,\" Def.\\'s Mem. at 10-11 & n.3, Ex. 19\\n\\n(ADS \u00a7 418.5.8(g) (2001)); (2) the plaintiff \"was not eligible for that position as a lateral\\n\\nreassignment,\" and, in fact, the Agency official who made the reassignment \"did not consider\\n\\nany GS-14 employees[, the plaintiff\\'s grade level at that time,] for the position,\" Def.\\'s Mem. at\\n\\n9; (3) the plaintiff \"never expressed any interest in the position\" when the lateral transfer was\\n\\nmade, id.; (4) the plaintiff\\'s argument that he would have been a competitive candidate for the\\n\\nposition because his \"qualifications do not make him so starkly better qualified than [the\\n\\ntransferred candidate]\" is based on nothing other than mere speculation, id. at 13; and (5) the\\n\\nplaintiff has not established causation because he challenges an employment decision that\\n\\noccurred prior to the Agency official\\'s awareness of the plaintiff\\'s prior protected activity \u2013 the\\n\\nPorter I litigation, id. at 31-32; Reply to Plaintiff\\'s Opposition to Defendant\\'s Motion for\\n\\nSummary Judgment (\"Def.\\'s Reply\") at 5-6. The Agency further contends that even if the\\n\\nplaintiff has established a prima facie case, it laterally transferred the individual selected because\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 40\\n\\x0che was better suited for the Administrator Officer position, Def.\\'s Mem. at 13-14, and therefore\\n\\nthe plaintiff cannot maintain this retaliation claim. 15\\n\\n        It is beyond dispute that the plaintiff\\'s EEO activity and previous lawsuit alleging Title\\n\\nVII violations amount to statutorily protected activities, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (prohibiting\\n\\ndiscrimination against an employee because he \u201copposed any practice made an unlawful\\n\\nemployment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\\n\\nparticipated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter\u201d),\\n\\nand therefore the defendant challenges the plaintiff\\'s ability to establish the remaining two\\n\\nelements of his prima facie case \u2013 that there was an adverse personnel action and causation.\\n\\nDef.\\'s Mem. at 9-11, 31-32. Because the Court is satisfied that causation is not the element that\\n\\nposes a barrier to the plaintiff\\'s prima facie case, it will dispose first of that issue before\\n\\ndiscussing whether the Agency\\'s lateral transfer of another employee caused him to sustain an\\n\\nadverse personnel action.\\n\\n        In assessing whether the causation component of the plaintiff\\'s prima facie case has been\\n\\nsatisfied, evidence of the temporal proximity between purported protected activity and the\\n\\nchallenged personnel action, as well as the Agency\\'s awareness of the plaintiff\\'s protected\\n\\nactivity, are relevant factors that should be considered by the Court. See Clark County Sch.\\n\\nDist., 532 U.S. at 273-74 (requiring \"very close\" temporal proximity between the time of \"an\\n\\n15\\n         While the Agency urges that because the transferred candidate also had engaged in \"prior EEO\\nactivity,\" it is \"highly unlikely\" that the Agency would have singled out the plaintiff to retaliate against\\nhim for the plaintiff\\'s participation in statutorily protected activity, Def.\\'s Mem. at 14, the transferred\\ncandidate\\'s activity appears to have been in the nature of an administrative\/investigative participant in an\\nEEO matter, not as a complainant who had filed a grievance, see Def.\\'s Mem., Ex. 33 (Aug. 26, 2001\\nAffidavit of Tim Winchell). Considering that an administrative or investigative role in an EEO\\nproceeding is in no way comparable to the filing of an EEO complaint and a subsequent lawsuit, the\\nlogical connection between the two situations is unclear, and the Court will not address the matter further.\\n\\n\\n                                                    41\\n\\x0cemployer\\'s knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action\" (citation\\n\\nomitted)). At first blush, the temporal proximity between the date that the plaintiff filed his\\n\\ncomplaint in Porter I, August 11, 2000, see Compl., Porter I, Civ. No. 00-1954 (D.D.C. Aug. 11,\\n\\n2000), and the date of the lateral transfer, May 28, 2001, Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 62, seems too great to\\n\\nmake any inferential link between the two events. However, because the plaintiff has alleged\\n\\nthat the statutorily protected activity in which he was engaged included his \"filing [of] numerous\\n\\nadministrative grievances and EEO claims against the Agency and [his act of] filing and\\n\\nsuccessfully litigating the 2000 Lawsuit against the Agency,\" First Amended Complaint (\"Am.\\n\\nCompl.\") \u00b6 32 (emphasis added), the Court is satisfied the plaintiff has satisfactorily pled\\n\\ncausation as part of his prima facie case. This is because a plaintiff\\'s \"participation\" in a\\n\\nstatutorily protected activity can support a retaliation claim if the plaintiff is discriminated\\n\\nagainst for exercising that right. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (prohibiting discrimination against\\n\\nan employee because he \u201copposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this\\n\\nsubchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in\\n\\nan investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter\u201d). And during the time when the\\n\\nplaintiff continued to pursue his protected activity, he was protected from being retaliated against\\n\\nbased on his pursuit of that activity. See, e.g., Casole v. Johanns, 577 F. Supp. 2d 138, 140-41\\n\\n(D.D.C. 2008) (finding that the plaintiff\\'s continuing participation in EEO-protected activity\\n\\nprecluded dismissal of the claim based on lack of causation); See also Deravin v. Kerik, 335 F.3d\\n\\n195, 204 (2d Cir. 2003) (\"defending oneself against charges of discrimination \u2013 to the extent that\\n\\nsuch defense involves actual participation in a Title VII proceeding or investigation \u2013 is\\n\\n\\'protected activity\\' within the scope of \u00a7 704(a) [i.e., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a)] based on a plain\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  42\\n\\x0creading of the statute\\'s text.\"). Here, for example, the plaintiff contends that although he initiated\\n\\nhis lawsuit in August of 2000, he was still actively engaged in that litigation, demonstrated by\\n\\nthe fact that he deposed an Agency witnesses in September of 2001, only four months after the\\n\\nselection for the Administrative Officer position was made, Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 66, which the Court\\n\\nfinds clearly establishes the Agency\u2019s knowledge of the plaintiff\\'s continued active participation\\n\\nin protected activity. The Court therefore finds that a sufficient temporal nexus between the\\n\\nplaintiff\\'s participation in Porter I and his non-selection for the administrative officer position\\n\\nexists to permit the inference of a causal relation between the two events.\\n\\n        It is with the adverse employment action element of the plaintiff\\'s prima facie case that\\n\\ndifficulty for the plaintiff arises. First, the Agency\\'s decision not to utilize the competition\\n\\nprocess was authorized by the Agency\\'s internal policy. 16 See Def.\\'s Mem., Ex. 19 (ADS \u00a7\\n\\n418.5.8(g) (2001)). However, although authorized, such a decision could be actionable as an\\n\\nadverse employment action if it was \"tantamount to refusing to promote [the plaintiff].\" Cones\\n\\nv. Shalala, 199 F.3d 512, 521 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (\"\\'no particular type of personnel action [is]\\n\\nautomatically excluded from serving as the basis of a cause of action\\' under Title VII, as long as\\n\\nthe plaintiff is \\'aggrieved\\' by the action\" (citation omitted)). While this first potential\\n\\nimpediment to the viability of this claim raises concerns, other problems actually doom the\\n\\nplaintiff\u2019s ability to maintain it.\\n\\n        A second problem for the plaintiff is the requirement that to maintain this claim, the\\n\\nplaintiff must show that he did what he could to express interest in the position at the time the\\n\\nposition was available. Id. at 518 (citing EEOC v. Metal Serv. Co., 892 F.2d 341, 348 (3d Cir.\\n\\n\\n16\\n        See note 11, supra.\\n\\n\\n                                                  43\\n\\x0c1990), for the principle that \"[c]ourts have generally held that the failure to formally apply for a\\n\\njob opening will not bar a Title VII plaintiff from establishing a prima facie case of\\n\\ndiscriminatory hiring, as long as the plaintiff made every reasonable attempt to convey his\\n\\ninterest in the job to the employer\"); see, e.g., Hussain v. Principi, 344 F. Supp. 2d 86, 97\\n\\n(D.D.C. 2004) (\"Though [the] plaintiff now contends he did want to be Chief of Radiology . . .\\n\\nhe does not produce evidence that he conveyed this interest to his superiors.\" (citation omitted)).\\n\\nThe plaintiff contends that he is relieved from this requirement because he \"ha[d] no opportunity\\n\\nto express his interest in [the Administrative Officer] position,\" and that \"[]he would have\\n\\napplied\" had the position been advertised. 17 Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 63 (citation omitted). While the\\n\\nplaintiff raises a question of fact concerning whether he had an opportunity to apply for the\\n\\nposition, 18 he has not raised a question of fact that is material based on the following deficiency\\n\\nthat dooms this retaliation claim.\\n\\n17\\n         The plaintiff goes so far as to suggest that knowledge of his interest in advancement to the\\nAdministrative Officer position should be constructively imposed on the Agency because the selecting\\nofficial should have known that he was interested in advancing beyond his pay grade level to any GS-15\\nposition. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 64-65. The plaintiff\\'s position finds no support in existing precedent, nor should it\\nbe afforded legal significance. Acceptance of his position would logically lend itself to the proposition\\nthat the plaintiff had or will in the future have constructively expressed an interest in acquiring any GS-15\\nposition filed by the Agency during his tenure as a GS-14 level employee merely because of his\\ncontinuing advancement aspirations. Cf. Morgan v. Fed. Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 172 F. Supp. 2d\\n98, 109 (D.D.C. 2001) (stating that \"there must be an available position\" which a plaintiff expresses an\\ninterest in acquiring before a claim for discrimination can be pursued). More is needed, and the absence\\nfrom the record of any actual expression by the plaintiff of his interest in a particular position that he later\\ncomplains he was not selected casts doubt on the sincerity of the claim and whether it is the mere\\nmanufacture of hindsight and creativity.\\n18\\n         The plaintiff testified in his deposition that \"he recalled \u2013 from reading the Agency\u2019s Report of\\nInvestigation \u2013 an e-mail in which an[other] employee had expressed interest in either a GS-14 or GS-15\\nAdministrative Officer position,\" and even knew that that person served in that role on a temporary basis,\\nprior to the Agency\\'s decision to fill the position permanently through the lateral transfer at issue. Pl.\\'s\\nOpp\\'n at 64. The plaintiff now maintains, however, that because there is no evidence that \"any other\\nemployee expressed interest in the permanent GS-15 Administrative Officer position,\" as opposed to the\\ntemporary position, that his claim should not be defeated by the fact that he did not express interest in the\\nposition when it was available. Id. (emphasis added). Absent evidence that the plaintiff expressed any\\n                                                                                              (continued . . . )\\n                                                      44\\n\\x0c        Even assuming that the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, he still falls short of\\n\\nadequately rebutting the Agency\\'s legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its lateral transfer\\n\\ndecision. The Agency has explained that it non-competitively transferred an existing GS-15\\n\\ngrade level employee into the position based on its assessment of his \"exceptional credentials\\n\\nand demonstrated excellence in his previous positions.\" Def.\\'s Mem. at 14. For the reasons\\n\\nalready articulated in the Court\\'s analysis of why the plaintiff cannot maintain a claim of racial\\n\\ndiscrimination with respect to his non-selection for this position, the plaintiff has similarly not\\n\\nestablished that the Agency\\'s transfer process was an improper pretext for retaliation. The\\n\\nplaintiff\\'s contention that his six years experience in a similar position at the GS-14 grade level,\\n\\nwhich was a lower grade level than the level held by the transferred candidate, and that a\\n\\npromotion would have been \"a natural progression\" for his career, Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 65, rendered him\\n\\nmore qualified than the person who was transferred, are inadequate for the Court to infer that the\\n\\nAgency\\'s implementation of an authorized lateral transfer was utilized for the purpose of\\n\\nretaliating against the plaintiff. Accordingly, the Court must grant summary judgment to the\\n\\nAgency on Count IV of the plaintiff\\'s second amended complaint.\\n\\n3.      The Deputy Chief Position\\n\\n        In Count VI of his second amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges that in October 2001,\\n\\nthe Agency retaliated against him for his participation in prior protected activity, again the\\n\\nlitigation of Porter I, when it selected an African-American female for the position of Deputy\\n\\ninterest in the position, the Court is hesitant to construe the Agency\\'s decision to laterally staff the\\nposition as grounds to relieve the plaintiff of his burden to demonstrate that he expressed an interest in\\nacquiring the position. And the plaintiff never expressed an interest in the position until after the position\\nwas filled on a permanent basis, see Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 62-64, even though either the temporary staffing of the\\nposition alone, or the e-mail in which another employee expressed an interest in filling the position,\\nshould have put the plaintiff on notice that the Agency might permanently fill the position.\\n\\n\\n                                                     45\\n\\x0cChief during the pendency of the Porter I litigation. 19 Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 11. The plaintiff asserts that\\n\\nthe defendant\\'s explanation for its selection decision is pretextual because the successful\\n\\ncandidate was not qualified for the position since she did not have a college degree, an expressed\\n\\nqualification for the position, id. at 61, while he held three degrees when the selection was made,\\n\\nPl.\\'s Facts Statement, Ex. 2 (Resume of Melvin C. Porter). The Agency proffers that it selected\\n\\nthe successful candidate based on her credentials, supervisory experience, and her \"long and\\n\\ndistinguished career at the [A]gency\" and not for a retaliatory reason. Def.\\'s Mem. at 18. The\\n\\nAgency contends that \"there is little or no evidence that the decision makers focused on, or even\\n\\nrecognized th[e] fact\" that the successful candidate did not have a college degree. Def.\\'s Reply at\\n\\n10.\\n\\n        As a starting point for the Court\\'s analysis of the sustainability of this claim, it reiterates\\n\\nthe finding made concerning the plaintiff\\'s gender discrimination claim regarding this same\\n\\nposition and likewise concludes that the plaintiff has satisfied his burden to establish a prima\\n\\nfacie case of retaliation as to the Deputy Chief position. Namely, that the Agency hired a female\\n\\nfor the position instead of the plaintiff, which was an adverse employment action, during the\\n\\npendency of Porter I, which is a statutorily protected activity, one month after his supervisor was\\n\\ndeposed in Porter I, which is sufficiently close in time to reasonably infer a causal connection\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n         The plaintiff also asserts that because the Agency filled the Deputy Chief position twenty days\\nafter his supervisor was deposed in Porter I, and that same supervisor supervised the actual hiring official\\nand concurred with that official\\'s decision, that material questions of fact exist as to the supervisor\\'s\\ninfluence over the selection decision that precludes summary judgment on this claim. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 60.\\nTo the contrary, absent any evidence proffered by the plaintiff that the supervisor exerted undue or\\nimproper influence over the decision, and did not merely just concur with the hiring official\\'s decision,\\nimproper pressure based upon a retaliatory motive would require speculation and cannot reasonably be\\ninferred from the evidence in the record.\\n\\n\\n                                                     46\\n\\x0cbetween the two events. Vickers, 493 F.3d at 194. Therefore, the plaintiff has established his\\n\\nprima facie case of retaliation.\\n\\n       Yet, as the Court explained with respect to the plaintiff\\'s gender discrimination claim\\n\\nconcerning the selection decision for the Deputy Chief position, neither the successful candidate\\n\\nnor the plaintiff met the express requirements outlined in the education section of the vacancy\\n\\nannouncement for the position. See Def.\\'s Mem., Ex. 32 (Position Description). Moreover, the\\n\\nevidence does not establish that the Agency considered the candidates\\' educational deficiencies\\n\\nin the final analysis, but rather focused on the nature of their experience and the quality of their\\n\\nperformance while employed by the Agency as the factors that formed the basis for its selection\\n\\ndecision. Def.\\'s Reply at 10-11. Thus, the legitimate, non-retaliatory explanation the Agency\\n\\nprovided for its selection of the successful candidate was that she was better suited for the\\n\\nposition. Id. In the absence of more persuasive evidence of retaliation in the record, the Court\\n\\nwill not question the weight the Agency allocated to the various factors it considered or read an\\n\\nimpermissible retaliatory motive into that decision. Jackson, 496 F.3d at 707 (\"Particularly\\n\\ngiven the dynamic nature of the hiring process, . . . we have also stated that we will not second-\\n\\nguess how an employer weighs particular factors in the hiring decision.\"); see also Barnette v.\\n\\nChertoff, 453 F.3d 513, 517 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\"[C]ourts must defer to the employer\\'s decision as\\n\\nto which qualities required by the job . . . it weighs more heavily.\"). It is uncontested that the\\n\\nfemale selected for the position did not have a formal educational background that rivaled the\\n\\nplaintiff\\'s. However, her supervisory experience \u2013 including her supervision of the plaintiff and\\n\\ntemporary occupation of the Deputy Chief position \u2013 coupled with the quality of her\\n\\nperformance as a supervisor were the Agency\\'s proffered reasons for her selection. Further, the\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 47\\n\\x0cCourt\\'s comparison of the candidates\\' employment histories, as already set forth above, does not\\n\\ndemonstrate that the plaintiff was significantly better qualified. See discussion at 29-31, supra.\\n\\nAccordingly, the Court will not second-guess the Agency\\'s business decision nor find that its\\n\\nexplanation for the selection decision is merely a pretext for unlawful retaliation against the\\n\\nplaintiff. The Court must therefore award summary judgment to the Agency on Count VI of the\\n\\nsecond amended complaint.\\n\\n        4.       The Plaintiff\\'s 2003 Mid-Year Performance and 2004 Interim Performance\\n\\nAssessments 20\\n\\n        In Counts XII and XIV of the plaintiff\\'s second amended complaint, he challenges his\\n\\n2003 mid-year performance assessment and his 2004 interim performance assessment\\n\\nrespectively. Specifically, in Count XII, he alleges that the Agency retaliated against him by\\n\\ngiving him a mid-year assessment in July 2003 of \"borderline unacceptable\" performance due to\\n\\nhis prior protected activity, the Porter I litigation and his EEO activity. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 9-10. The\\n\\nplaintiff contends that his supervisor\\'s rationale for this negative assessment of his performance\\n\\nwas based on her false representation that the plaintiff \"fail[ed] to complete work in a timely\\n\\nfashion.\" Id. at 9-10, 48-50. The plaintiff alleges that the supervisor knew about the Porter I\\n\\nlitigation, as well as his November 2002 EEO complaint, evidenced by the fact she submitted an\\n\\naffidavit and an addendum to this submission only several days prior to rendering her negative\\n\\nperformance assessment. Id. at 32-33. In addition, the plaintiff alleges that the oral assessment\\n\\nwas delivered to him in the presence of a senior manager, although the meeting should have\\n\\nincluded only the plaintiff and one supervisor. Id. at 10, 30.\\n\\n20\\n         The Court will consider these two claims collectively based on their inherent similarities and the\\nfact that they suffer from the same defect which forms the basis for the Court\\'s grant of summary\\njudgment to the Agency on both claims.\\n\\n                                                    48\\n\\x0c       Similarly, in Count XIV of his second amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges that in\\n\\nSeptember 2004, the Agency retaliated against him for his participation in the identical prior\\n\\nprotected activity when his supervisor provided him with a \"Notice of Unacceptable\\n\\nPerformance\" (\"Notice\"), id. at 10, without offering, as he opines was also the case for the 2003\\n\\nmid-year performance assessment, \"a single legitimate business reason\" for the evaluation, id. at\\n\\n48. The plaintiff contends that the Notice \"pertained to his \\'Executive Support\\' work objective,\\n\\nand focused specifically on [the supervisor\\'s] allegations that [he] did not complete tasks in a\\n\\ntimely fashion,\" which he contends \"were wholly without basis.\" Id. at 48. The plaintiff also\\n\\ncontends that \"the Notice was accompanied by a Performance Improvement Plan, which entailed\\n\\na concrete threat of demotion, termination, reassignment or withholding of within grade\\n\\nincreases.\" Id. at 11. As with his 2003 mid-year assessment, the plaintiff contends the Agency\\'s\\n\\nrationale for the negative 2004 interim assessment was without merit. Namely, he alleges that\\n\\nthe Notice was \"rife with misstatements of fact,\" including allegations of non-existent \"\\'cost\\n\\noverruns\\'\" and unfounded criticism of his \"role in the Agency award process,\" which were\\n\\n\"placed in [his] personnel file.\" Id. at 10-11. The plaintiff alleges that the Notice \"foreshadowed\\n\\n[his] \\'Needs Improvement\\' final evaluation [he] received . . . followed by a loss of a bonus.\" Id.\\n\\nat 30-31. The plaintiff contends that both of these assessments amounted to adverse employment\\n\\nactions because they \"\\'well might\\' dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a\\n\\ncharge of discrimination,\" \"render[ed] [him] significantly more vulnerable to an involuntary\\n\\ndemotion or separation from the Agency,\" and resulted in him being \"denied eligibility for a\\n\\nbonus and for a promotion.\" Id. at 29-30.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 49\\n\\x0c       The Agency responds that the plaintiff cannot maintain claims of retaliation based on his\\n\\n2003 mid-year and 2004 interim assessments because \"poor performance evaluations are\\n\\ngenerally not adverse employment actions for purposes of establishing a prima facie case of\\n\\ndiscrimination or retaliation where, as here, the rating[s] do[] not affect an employee\\'s grade or\\n\\nsalary or have other materially adverse consequences.\" Def.\\'s Mem. at 26-27 (citing Russell v.\\n\\nPrincipi, 257 F.3d 815, 818 (D.C. Cir. 2001); Brown v. Brody, 199 F.3d 446, 458 (D.C. Cir.\\n\\n1999); Carter v. George Washington Univ., 180 F. Supp. 2d 97, 108-109 (D.D.C. 2001); Mack v.\\n\\nStrauss, 134 F.

The Agency asserts that these assessments resulted in \"no\\n\\n\\'tangible harm\\' or \\'materially adverse consequence\\'\" because they were \"provisional and non-\\n\\nfinal reviews or assessments.\" Id. at 28. The Court agrees.\\n\\n       As to the issue of causation, the plaintiff initiated Porter I in August 2000. Compl.,\\n\\nPorter I (D.D.C. Aug. 11, 2000). After a trial on the merits and some post-trial proceedings that\\n\\nwere resolved adversely to the plaintiff, the District of Columbia Circuit rendered its decision on\\n\\nthe plaintiff\\'s appeal in Porter I on July 1, 2005, affirming the District Court judgment.\\n\\nJudgment, Porter I (D.C. Cir. July 1, 2005). As the Court discussed earlier in its analysis of\\n\\nwhether the plaintiff could maintain his retaliation claim based on his non-selection for the\\n\\nAdministrative Officer position, because the litigation in Porter I was still in progress when the\\n\\nplaintiff received the two mid-year and interim job performance assessments complained of here,\\n\\nthe Court finds that the temporal proximity element of the plaintiff\\'s prima facie case is satisfied.\\n\\nSee, e.g., Casole, 577 F. Supp. 2d at 140-41 (finding that the plaintiff\\'s protected activity, which\\n\\nwas ongoing when the alleged retaliation occurred, precluded dismissal based on lack of\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 50\\n\\x0ccausation); see also Deravin, 335 F.3d at 204 (\"[D]efending oneself against charges of\\n\\ndiscrimination \u2013 to the extent that such defense involves actual participation in a Title VII\\n\\nproceeding or investigation \u2013 is \\'protected activity\\' within the scope of \u00a7 704(a)[,] [i.e., 42 U.S.C.\\n\\n\u00a7 2000e-3(a),] based on a plain reading of the statute\\'s text.\").\\n\\n         However, neither the plaintiff\\'s 2003 mid-year nor his 2004 interim assessment is the\\n\\ntype of personnel action that would objectively deter a reasonable employee from making a\\n\\nclaim of discrimination, Burlington, 548 U.S. at 68, and neither \"\\'affect[ed] the [plaintiff\\'s] grade\\n\\nor salary,\\'\" or occasioned any other \"\\'significant change in [his] employment status,\\'\" Taylor v.\\n\\nSmall, 350 F.3d 1286, 1293 (D.C.

Indeed, the 2003 mid-year assessment was delivered orally and\\n\\ndocumented in his file \"only by the fact of the meeting and not by any particular rating.\" Def.\\'s\\n\\nMem. at 28. This is hardly the type of personnel action that can form the basis for a Title VII\\n\\nclaim.\\n\\n         On the other hand, the 2004 interim assessment was written and, according to the\\n\\nplaintiff, placed in his personnel file. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 11. The plaintiff also contends that both his\\n\\nmid-year 2003 and interim 2004 assessments contributed to subsequent year-end assessments\\n\\nand further negative consequences. Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 10 (\"[T]his [July 2003] rating, which is usually\\n\\naccompanied by a Performance Improvement Plan, laid the foundation for an annual \\'Needs\\n\\nImprovement\\' rating . . . at the end of 2003.\" (emphasis added)); id. at 11 (\"As foreshadowed by\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  51\\n\\x0cthis [September 2004] Notice of Unacceptable Performance, Mr. Porter received a \\'Needs\\n\\nImprovement\\' final evaluation in 2004, followed by a loss of a bonus and continued ineligibility\\n\\nfor a promotion.\" (emphasis added)). Moreover, unlike his 2003 mid-year oral assessment, the\\n\\nplaintiff claims his 2004 \"Notice of Unacceptable Performance\" coincided with \"a Performance\\n\\nImprovement Plan, which entailed a concrete threat of demotion, termination, reassignment or\\n\\nwithholding of within grade increases.\" Pl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 11. Yet, as the Agency points out, \"[t]he\\n\\n2004 performance plan is not a part of the claims in this case,\" Def.\\'s Reply at 14, and indeed, it\\n\\nis the actual assessment that the plaintiff now contests. And, assessments that contain \"job-\\n\\nrelated constructive criticism, which \\'can prompt an employee to improve [the employee\\'s]\\n\\nperformance\\'\" are not actionable as adverse actions unless a plaintiff can show that they are\\n\\nlinked \"to financial harms;\" meaning that the assessment \"could affect [the employee\\'s] position,\\n\\ngrade level, salary, or promotion opportunities.\" Baloch v. Kempthorne, 550 F.3d 1191, 1199\\n\\n(D.C. Cir. 2008) (finding that letter of counseling, letter of reprimand, and unsatisfactory\\n\\nperformance review were not the type of evaluations that resulted in actionable financial harms);\\n\\nWeber, 494 F.3d at 185-86 (stating that negative performance evaluations \"do qualify as adverse\\n\\nactions insofar as they resulted in [the employee] losing a financial award or an award of leave,\\n\\nbecause a reasonable jury could conclude that such a loss \\'could well dissuade a reasonable\\n\\nworker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination\\'\" (citation omitted)). The plaintiff\\n\\nhas made no such showing here.\\n\\n       Specifically, the plaintiff has not shown how the mid-year and interim performance\\n\\nassessments could not have been remedied by improved performance that presumably would\\n\\nhave averted any financial harm or other negative employment consequences prior to his year-\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 52\\n\\x0cend evaluations.

While it\\n\\nis understandable why the plaintiff is unhappy with the two negative assessments, \"not\\n\\neverything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse action.\" Russell, 257 F.3d\\n\\nat 818 (stating performance evaluations are unlikely to be actionable as adverse actions). Both\\n\\nassessments appear to be among \"those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at\\n\\nwork and that all employees experience.\" Burlington, 548 U.S. at 69; accord Page v. Bolger, 645\\n\\nF.2d 227, 233 (4th Cir. 1981) (holding that \"steps in a process for making such obvious end-\\n\\ndecisions as those to hire, to promote, etc.\" are among those \"many interlocutory or mediate\\n\\ndecisions having no immediate effect upon employment conditions which were not intended to\\n\\nfall within the direct proscriptions of . . . Title VII\"). Such is the case with the interim and mid-\\n\\nyear assessments of the plaintiff\\'s performance, because alone, neither caused the plaintiff any\\n\\nactionable harm. As the Agency points out, \"a \\'mid-cycle review\\' is not even a rating or\\n\\nevaluation under [the Agency\\'s] rules,\" and \"unless the employee requests otherwise, \\'interim\\n\\nevaluations are retained in the operating unit and not submitted to the Office of Human\\n\\nResources for filing in an employee\u2019s Official Evaluation File.\\'\" Def.\\'s Mem. at 29. Although\\n\\nthe plaintiff maintains that the Agency put his 2004 interim assessment in his personnel folder,\\n\\nPl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 11, since his grade or salary went unaffected until he received his final 2004\\n\\nassessment, it is difficult to discern how the plaintiff could maintain that the 2004 interim\\n\\nassessment, and not his 2004 final assessment, is the event that \"\\'affect[ed] [his] grade or salary.\\'\"\\n\\nTaylor, 350 F.3d at 1293 (citation omitted). An employment decision which merely \"la[ys] the\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  53\\n\\x0cfoundation\" for another employment decision which has grade or salary consequences, Pl.\\'s\\n\\nOpp\\'n at 10, is not actionable because it had \"no immediate effect upon [the plaintiff\\'s]\\n\\nemployment conditions,\" Page, 645 F.2d at 233. The two interim performance assessments were\\n\\nessentially nothing more than warnings that future negative final assessments could be\\n\\nforthcoming if the plaintiff did not improve his performance, as compared to actions with \"direct,\\n\\nmeasurable, and immediate effect[s].\" Russell, 257 F.3d at 819.\\n\\n       The plaintiff also alleges that the presence of a second superior when his 2003 mid-year\\n\\nassessment was provided to him was improper and amounted to an adverse employment action.\\n\\nPl.\\'s Opp\\'n at 10. However, the record is devoid of any internal \"Agency policy,\" id., or other\\n\\nsuch authority from which the Court could find that the presence of more than one of the\\n\\nplaintiff\\'s superiors at a meeting to discuss his job performance was improper. And the Court\\n\\nfails to see how the simple presence of two supervisors, instead of one, somehow rendered the\\n\\nmeeting anything other than \"private.\" Id. In any event, the presence of the additional\\n\\nsupervisor did not amount to an adverse employment action. Thus, the Court must award\\n\\nsummary judgment to the Agency on Counts XII and XIV of the plaintiff\\'s second amended\\n\\ncomplaint.\\n\\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\\n\\n       For all of the reasons set forth above, Counts VII, IX, XI, and XIII, as well as on the race\\n\\ndiscrimination claim asserted in Count V are dismissed with the plaintiff\\'s consent.

Cunningham on October 1, 2002 (Doc. # 19); and the Upsilon Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity at Auburn University on January 31, 2003 (Doc. #38). These motions have been fully briefed. No oral argument was held. After careful consideration of the relevant law and the record as a whole, the Court concludes that the motions to dismiss are due to be DENIED ir. part, and GRANED in part.\\nAndrew Jackson\\'s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.\\nPaul D. Cunningham\\'s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.\\nThe Motion to Dismiss of the Upsilon Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity at Auburn University is GRANTED with respect to dismissing Plaintiff\\'s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) claim (i.e., Count 3) against the Chapter, and with respect to dismissing any claims against any Defendant arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982 (Count 2), arising under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, or arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq.\\nIn all other respects, the Upsilon Chapter\\'s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.\\n\\nI. PROCEDURE HISTORY\\n\\nThe Plaintiff filed his Complaint (Doc. #1) on July 15, 2002. Originally the Complaint brought causes of action against Jackson, Cunningham, and the Pi Kappa Alpha Club of Auburn. In response to information produced by Defendants in their initial pleadings, memoranda, and other filings, Plaintiff amended his Complaint (Doc. # 27) and substituted the Upsilon Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity at Auburn University (hereinafter \"Upsilon Chapter\") for the Pi Kappa Alpha Club of Auburn, Alabama. This substitution was approved by the Court (Doc. # 31). Originally the Complaint brought three federal and four state causes of action. The causes of action based upon federal law alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (Count 1); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982 (Count 2); and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) (Count 3).[1] Each of the three federal counts also *1141 alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. And, each federal cause of action was brought against each Defendant.[2] The causes of action based upon state law included assault and battery (Count 4); tort of outrage (Count 5); willfulness, wantonness and\/or negligence (Count 6); and negligent supervision and control (Count 7). Counts 4 and 5 are brought exclusively against the individual Defendants, Jackson and Cunningham. Count 6 is brought against all Defendants under a theory that the Upsilon Chapter is vicariously liable for the actions of the individual Defendants. Count 7 is brought exclusively against the Upsilon Chapter. Count 2 and any cause of action arising from Title VII were voluntarily abandoned by the Plaintiff\\x97albeit without any formal amendment of his Complaint. The only federal claims that remain are 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (Count 1) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) (Count 3). See infra note 1.\\nEach Defendant has moved for dismissal of the Complaint (Docs. # 10, #19, and # 38).[3] Each Defendant has brought a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) taking the position that the Plaintiff has failed to state a claim with regard to both of the two remaining federal causes of action (Counts 1 and 3). See infra note 4. And, concomitantly, Defendants have argued that because a viable federal cause of action is lacking, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the remaining causes of action grounded in Alabama law.\\n\\nII. MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARDS\\n\\nAs stated above, each Defendant has made a 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a federal claim for which relief can be granted.[4] Such a motion tests the Complaint\\'s legal sufficiency. \"In appraising the sufficiency of the complaint we follow, of course, the accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\" Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957) (Black, J.); see also Wright v. Newsome, 795 F.2d 964, 967 (11th Cir. 1986) (per curiam) (same). \"In reviewing the complaint, we accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and construe the facts in the light most favorable to the *1142 plaintiff.\" Maggio v. Sipple, 211 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2000) (Hull, J.); Romero v. City of Clanton, 220 F.Supp.2d 1313, 1315 (M.D.Ala.2002) (Albritton, C.J.) (same). Thus, \"[t]he threshold of sufficiency that a complaint must meet to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is ... `exceedingly low.\\'\" Ancata v. Prison Health Services, Inc., 769 F.2d 700, 703 (11th Cir.1985) (Clark, J.) (quoting Quality Foods de Centro America, S.A v. Latin American Agribusiness Development Corp., S.A., 711 F.2d 989, 995 (11th Cir.1983) (Hill, J.)).\\n\\nIII. FACTS BASED UPON MATERIALS PRESENTED BY THE PARTIES\\n\\nThe following is a brief summary of the relevant facts, accepting Belfast\\'s wellpleaded factual allegations as true and construing them in a light most favorable to him.\\nAccording to the Plaintiffs Complaint, the Upsilon Chapter is a non-profit corporation organized under the laws of Alabama. The corporate status of the Chapter is disputed by the Chapter. The exact status of the Chapter can be determined in a later stage of this litigation. And in any event, nothing in this opinion turns on the corporate status of the Chapter. The individual Defendants, Cunningham and Jackson, are both Caucasian[5] male citizens of the United States, both reside in Alabama, both are over the age of nineteen, and both are members of the Upsilon Chapter.\\nMark Belfast is an African-American male residing in Alabama. He is over nineteen years old. Belfast was employed by Papa John\\'s Pizza. Papa John\\'s provided service to the campus of Auburn University. On April 6, 2001, Belfast was making a delivery of Papa John\\'s food to the Upsilon Chapter. Upon arrival, Jackson poured beer on Belfast\\'s car. Thereafter the individual Defendants cooperated with one another in physically attacking Belfast. In consequence of this attack, Belfast suffered substantial physical injuries (some of which are permanent and\/or disfiguring), endured pain and suffering (including emotional and mental distress), incurred medical (and legal) bills, lost past and future wages\\x97including future diminished earning capacity. Prior to this incident, Cunningham had already verbally assaulted Belfast on another occasion ostensibly for delivering pizza to the wrong address and that both incidents were a result of racial animus. The Upsilon Chapter knew of (or should have known of) both the prior incident and it knew of (or should have known of) other similar incidents.\\n\\nIV. DISCUSSION\\n\\nPlaintiff has brought causes of action grounded in federal and state law. Defendants have moved to dismiss the federal claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Defendants have also, correctly, argued that in the absence of a viable federal claim, this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the state law claims. The Court will examine each one of these contentions in turn.\\n\\n1. Federal Claims\\nPlaintiff brings a cause of action alleging that Defendants violated his rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(a) (2003):\\n\\n*1143 All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.\\nThe current statute is devolved from the Civil Rights Act of April 9, 1866, c. 31, 14 Stat. 27 (1866). And, it has remained substantially unchanged\\x97at least until the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (Nov. 21, 1991). In interpreting the statutory language, supra, the Supreme Court has held:\\nBy its plain terms, the relevant provision in \u00a7 1981 protects two rights: \"the same right ... to make ... contracts\" and \"the same right ... to ... enforce contracts.\" The first of these protections extends only to the formation of a contract, but not to problems that may arise later from the conditions of continuing employment.... [P]ostformation conduct does not involve the right to make a contract, but rather implicates the performance of established contract obligations and the conditions of continuing employment, matters more naturally governed by state contract law and Title VII.\\n.....\\nThe second of these guarantees, \"the same right ... to ... enforce contracts... as is enjoyed by white citizens,\" embraces protection of a legal process, and of a right of access to legal process, that will address and resolve contractlaw claims without regard to race. In this respect, it prohibits discrimination that infects the legal process in ways that prevent one from enforcing contract rights, by reason of his or her race, and this is so whether this discrimination is attributed to a statute or simply to existing practices.\\nPatterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 176-77, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989) (Kennedy, J.) (emphasis added).\\nIn the instant case, Plaintiff has not argued that his access to the legal process or his right to enforce a contract to which he is a party has been denied on account of race. Instead, Plaintiff has alleged in his Complaint that the assault and battery allegedly committed by the Defendants: (i) interfered with his right to make a contract of sale with a Papa John\\'s customer to whom he was making a yet uncompleted delivery; and (ii) interfered with his meeting his contractual obligations and duties owed his employer.[6] Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 18.[7]\\n*1144 Defendants dispute Plaintiffs factual contention and instead argue that Plaintiffs Complaint indicates that the food delivery was actually made and completed so that no contract for the sale of food was interfered with. (Doc. # 40 at \u00b6 18; Doc. #41 at \u00b6 B; Doc. #42 at \u00b6 A; Doc. #47 at \u00b6 A.) Moreover, Defendants argue that any alleged interference with Plaintiffs completing this particular sale wholly relates to postformation employment contract conditions or performance, and therefore, as a matter of law, is not actionable. See, e.g., Doc. #42 at \u00b6 A; Patterson at 176-77,109 S.Ct. 2363.\\nWith regard to the allegedly uncompleted contract for the sale of food, Plaintiff would not have been a party to that contract. The parties to that contract would have been Papa Johns (Plaintiffs employer) and the would-be customer. Whether or not an agent of a party to a contract can be said \"to make\" a contract as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 presents an interesting question of law. But it is not a question the Court must resolve because the Court is persuaded that Plaintiffs Complaint can be sustained with respect to the second contract, the employment contract. As explained above, Patterson, a decision of the United States Supreme Court, held that postformation contract conditions or performance is, or rather was, not actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. Patterson was decided in 1989. As explained above, in 1991 Congress amended 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 by adding new language expanding the reach of the statute. Civil Rights Act of 1991 \u00a7 3, Pub.L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (Nov. 21, 1991) (\"The purpose[] of this Act [is] to respond to recent decisions of the Supreme Court by expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.\") (emphasis added). The statute now includes the following language:\\nFor purposes of this section, the term \"make and enforce contracts\" includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(b) (2003) (emphasis added).\\nIn short, Patterson is no longer controlling law because it has been superseded by a more recent statute. See Jones v. Firestone Tire and Rubber, Co., Inc., 977 F.2d 527, 534 n. 8 (11th Cir.1992) (Tjoflat, C.J.). Moreover, just as Patterson is no longer controlling law, the bulk of the case law put forward by the parties in their briefing is not persuasive because those cases predate the 1991 amendments. See, e.g., Croy v. Skinner, 410 F.Supp. 117, 125 (N.D.Ga.1976). Plaintiff\\'s employment contract is a contract for the purposes of this statute. Plaintiffs postformation performance under the employment contract is protected under the statute as amended. See Rogers v. Elliott, 135 F.Supp.2d 1312, 1314 (N.D.Ga.2001) (Pannell, J.) (including \"performance\" as protected activity). Moreover in a \u00a7 1981 case, Plaintiff is free to seek his remedy against the counterparty to the contract or against a thirdparty interferer. See, e.g., Faraca v. Clements, 506 F.2d 956, 959 (5th Cir.1975) (Clark, J.) (\"a third party\\'s interference with those rights guaranteed under Section[] 1981 ... will subject such a person to personal liability\"); see also Vakharia v. Swedish Covenant Hosp., 765 F.Supp. 461, 471 (N.D.Ill.1991) (\"relationship between the plaintiff and the third party-interferer is irrelevant\") (decided prior to Civil Rights Act of 1991).\\nPlaintiff alleges that the attack was motivated by racial animus. Compl. \u00b6 15. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs federal claims are insufficiently supported with factual allegations supporting racial *1145 animus as a motive and further contend that the bare bones statements in the Complaint alleging racial animus as the motive for the alleged attack are facially insufficient as a matter of law. (Doc. # 47 at 3-4.) Defendants\\' position is not well taken.[8] Not every attacker motivated by racial animus expresses the reason for his attack at the time of the battery. But cf. Walker v. Shepard, 107 F.Supp.2d 183 (N.D.N.Y.2000). Thus the absence of detailed factual allegations with regard to the confrontation is not conclusive that race was not a motivating fact. Plaintiff must have an opportunity to develop supporting facts through discovery. Nor do we expect plaintiffs to engage in extensive background checks of defendants prior to discovery in order to uncover material facts that might better support the allegations in their complaint. Such evidentiary development comes after the first round of dispositive motions, not before. In short, if a member of a minority group is attacked, without provocation, and the attackers cooperate, it is reasonable to infer and a plaintiff can properly allege\\x97without any other supporting proof\\x97that the attack was racially motivated. At a later stage of this litigation, Defendants are, of course, free to establish by affidavit or other competent evidence that: (i) there was no attack; or (ii) that the \"attack\" was provoked; or (iii) that the attackers did not act cooperatively or on the basis of some prior agreement; or (iv) that even if Defendants engaged in an unprovoked attack in conformity with some prior agreement, the attack itself was animated by nonracial motives. But at this stage, particularly because factual information relating to motive and purpose is peculiarly in the hands (and minds) of the Defendants, Plaintiff cannot be expected to do more than allege racial motivation or bias.\\nDefendants further argue that the allegation of racial bias is contradicted by *1146 other factual allegations in the Complaint. (Doc. # 47 at 3-4.) Defendants note that the alleged assault occurred after a prior incident at least in part caused by Plaintiffs misdelivery of some pizza. Specifically, Defendant Upsilon Chapter argues that the verbal confrontation between Defendant Cunningham and the Plaintiff in the prior incident fully explains the alleged attack that is the subject matter of this litigation without recourse to any theory of racial bias. Id. Defendant\\'s position is not well taken. It is not contradictory to assert that the disputed incident can have more than one motive\\x97which is precisely what Plaintiff alleges in his Complaint. Compl. \u00b6 12 (prior incident caused by misdelivery of pizza and racial bias). Contrary to Defendant\\'s statement, the claim of \"mis-delivered pizza [does not] negate[ ] racial animus as a reason.\" (Doc. # 47 at 4.)\\nIn addition to Plaintiffs 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 claim, Plaintiff has also brought a claim against all Defendants for violating his rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3).[9] This statute makes it illegal to participate in a conspiracy to deny a third-party his or her civil rights. Defendants have to all intents and purposes made identical arguments with respect to both Plaintiffs \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1985(3) causes of action. As explained above, Defendants have argued that Plaintiffs general allegation of racial animus based upon an alleged attack is insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. The Court has already rejected Defendants\\' argument with regard to Plaintiffs \u00a7 1981 claim. For the same reasons, this Court also rejects Defendants\\' argument with regard to Plaintiffs \u00a7 1985(3) claim. Under the circumstances of this case and at this stage of the litigation, Plaintiffs having made a good faith allegation of racial animus will withstand a motion to dismiss.\\nAdditionally, the Upsilon Chapter has argued that Plaintiffs \u00a7 1985(3) claim must fail because \"there is no allegation of racial animus or a conspiracy based on racial animus with regards to the Chapter.\" (Doc. # 41 at 4) (emphasis added). Defendant\\'s point is well taken. The Complaint alleges the existence of a conspiracy, but it does not allege that the Chapter was a member of that conspiracy. It does not allege a meeting of the minds between the Chapter (or its officers and agents) and any other individual Defendant, nor does it allege that the Chapter acted in concert with any other individual Defendant.\\nUnder the first \u00a7 1985(3) element, a plaintiff must show \"an agreement *1147 between the members of the alleged conspiracy.\" Godby v. Montgomery County Bd. of Educ, 996 F.Supp. 1390, 1412 (M.D.Ala.1998) [ (Albritton, C.J.) ]. As explained in Godby, \"[although the existence of a conspiracy may be supported by circumstantial evidence, there must be some indication that the individuals were acting, in some sense, in concert.\" Id. \"Where there is no indication of an agreement to act against the ... rights of an individual there is no cause of action under \u00a7 1985.\" Id. Campbell v. Civil Air Patrol, 131 F.Supp.2d 1303, 1315 (M.D.Ala.2001) (DeMent, J.). In the instant litigation, there is nothing for Plaintiff to show with regard to the Chapter\\'s participating in the conspiracy because its participation in the conspiracy has not even been alleged in the Complaint. This shortcoming is fatal to Plaintiffs \u00a7 1985(3) claim against the Chapter.[10] At most, the Complaint alleges that the Chapter had knowledge of the propensities and actions of the individual Defendants.[11] And knowledge is not sufficient. Id. at 1316 (\"Furthermore, assuming for the sake of argument that Parkhurst had knowledge of the `no talk\\' directive and the firing decisions, such knowledge or even acquiescence is not tantamount to an agreement.\").\\nThe Upsilon Chapter stated in it Motion to Dismiss that venue was improper. (Doc. # 38) However no argument was forthcoming in its brief on this point of law. Therefore the Court will not address the issue of venue. (Doc. # 41) Additionally the Chapter has argued that Plaintiffs claims arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982 (Count 2), arising under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, and arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. are without merit. Plaintiff has expressly abandoned these claims. See supra note 1. It will be so ordered.\\n\\n2. State Claims\\nDefendants have argued that this Court lacks supplemental jurisdiction over the counts grounded in Alabama law because the Court lacks jurisdiction over any viable federal claim. The Court has already rejected Defendants\\' position with regard to the viability (at this stage) of Plaintiffs federal claims. Furthermore, the Defendants in their motions to dismiss have made no free-standing arguments against the facial sufficiency of the state law claims. The Upsilon Chapter in a reply brief did discuss Alabama state case law, but this discussion was wholly in the context of addressing the sufficiency of Plaintiffs \u00a7 1985(3) claims. (Doc. # 47 at 3-6.) Nowhere have the Defendants asked this Court to apply those arguments (or any other arguments) to test the legal sufficiency of the state law claims. Moreover, the Court will not address arguments made for the first time in a reply brief. See, e.g., Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center v. Bowen, 815 F.2d 1435, *1148 1446 n. 16 (11th Cir.1987) (Clark, J.) (\"It is well settled that a party cannot argue an issue in its reply brief that was not preserved in its initial brief.\") (citing United States v. Oakley, 744 F.2d 1553, 1556 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam)).\\nBecause Plaintiff\\'s federal claims survive Defendants\\' motions to dismiss, the Court has supplemental jurisdiction to hear each and every state law cause of action. (Counts 4-7) In summary judgment motions following discovery, Defendants may bring up such arguments as they think proper to test the legal sufficiency of the state law claims\\x97if such arguments have not already been waived.\\n\\nV. CONCLUSION\\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED as follows:\\nAndrew Jackson\\'s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.\\nPaul D. Cunningham\\'s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.\\nThe Motion to Dismiss of the Upsilon Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity at Auburn University is GRANTED with respect to dismissing Plaintiffs 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) claim (i.e., Count 3) against the Chapter, and with respect to dismissing any claims against any Defendant arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982 (Count 2), arising under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, or arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq.\\nIn all other respects, the Upsilon Chapter\\'s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED. A separate Order will be entered in accordance with this Memorandum Opinion.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Within Counts 1,2, and 3, Plaintiff Belfast also asserted that Defendants\\' actions violated Plaintiff\\'s rights under the Equal Protection Clause. It is unclear if Plaintiff meant, even at that time, to support a cause of action directly arising under the Equal Protection Clause. In any event, in a subsequent memorandum, Plaintiff has rejected any such position. See Mark A. Belfast\\'s Memorandum Brief in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss filed by Upsilon Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity at Auburn University at 3 (Plaintiff has \"abandoned all federal law-based causes of action except for claims predicated on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.\") (bold omitted) (Doc. # 43).\\n[2]  The Plaintiff argues that this Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343(1)(4). The Court agrees.\\n[3]  Defendants briefs in support of their motions to dismiss can be found at: Doc. # 11 (Jackson); Doc. #16 (Jackson) (supplemental); Doc. # 14 (Pi Kappa Alpha Club of Auburn, Alabama) (brief of a Defendant dismissed from case); Doc. # 42 (Cunningham); Doc. #41 (Upsilon Chapter); Doc. #47 (Upsilon Chapter) (reply brief).\\n[4]  Fed.RXiv.P. 12(b)(6) is specifically referenced by Defendants Jackson and Cunningham\\'s motions to dismiss (Docs. # 10 and # 19). However, the Upsilon Chapter\\'s motion to dismiss (Doc. # 38) is brought generically under Rule 12(b). The Court assumes that the Upsilon Chapter\\'s position is consistent with its co-defendants. The Defendants\\' briefs sometimes indicate that the individual motions are brought both under 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1) (lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter), but no arguments were presented with specific reference to 12(b)(1).\\n[5]  Oddly, the (apparent) fact that both individual Defendants are Caucasian does not appear in Plaintiff\\'s Complaint. But see Pi Kappa Alpha Club of Auburn, Alabama\\'s Brief in Support of its Motion to Dismiss at 4 (\"the individual defendants are Caucasian\") (Doc. # 14); Upsilon Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity at Auburn University\\'s Brief in Support of its Motion to Dismiss at 4 (Doc. #41) (same). However, nothing in this opinion hinges on determining the race of the individual Defendants.\\n[6]  Plaintiff\\'s contractual obligations to his employer would have been implicated had he failed to complete the sale of food. Alternatively, even if Plaintiff was injured after completing the sale, had Plaintiff\\'s injuries rendered him unable to return to work to perform other duties, including making further deliveries, then his contractual obligations to his employer would have been equally implicated. In either event, whether the sale of food was completed or not, the Complaint expressly asserts allegations that Plaintiff\\'s injuries left him unable to perform some of his duties owed to his employer under the employment contract. Compl. \u00b6 18.\\n[7]  Although Plaintiff\\'s Complaint was not a model of clarity, Plaintiff\\'s Complaint put Defendants on sufficient notice that the Defendants\\' alleged assault interfered with two contracts: (i) a contract for the delivery and sale of food between Papa John\\'s and some unnamed customer; and (ii) an employment contract between Papa John\\'s and the Plaintiff. Compl. \u00b6 18; cf. also Mark A. Belfast\\'s Memorandum Brief in Response to the Recently Filed Brief in Support of Motion to Dismiss by Defendant Paul D. Cunningham at 2-3 (\"The underlying assault allegedly occurred while Mark Belfast was in the process of completing a commercial transaction .... [Defendants interfered with Mark Belfast\\'s ability to perform a contractual obligation.\").\\n[8]  Defendants note that the district court in Walker v. Shepard, 107 F.Supp.2d 183 (N.D.N.Y.2000), upheld the plaintiff\\'s \u00a7 1985(3) claim. Nevertheless Defendants seek to rely on this case by distinguishing it from the instant litigation. Defendants argue that Walker is distinguishable from the instant litigation because the Walker plaintiff produced \"substantial evidence\" of a conspiracy motivated by race. The Defendants are partly correct. Walker is distinguishable from the instant litigation because it was a decision on a motion for summary judgment; a case in such a posture imposes a burden on the plaintiff to produce facts supporting every element of his claim. In this litigation, at the motion to dismiss stage, no such burden falls on the Plaintiff; Plaintiffs well-pleaded allegations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. Another decision cited by the Chapter, Jackson v. County of JJOS Angeles, 29 Fed.Appx. 430, 2001 WL 1667801 (9th Cir.2001) (unpublished disposition), was an appeal following a full trial below\\x97procedurally well passed both the summary judgment and motion to dismiss stages. Again, Gray v. City of Eufaula, 31 F.Supp.2d 957 (M.D.Ala. 1998) (De-Ment, J.), cited by Defendants, is not on-point because it was a decision on a motion for summary judgment. The same can be said for countless other cases cited by Defendants, including: Brown v. Masonry Prods., Inc., 874 F.2d 1476 (11th Cir.1989); Cartwright v. Tacala, Inc., Civ. A. No. 99-00663, 2000 WL 33287445 (M.D.Ala., Nov. 1, 2000) (Walker, M.J.); etc. Thus the Plaintiff has the right to avail himself of an opportunity to produce evidence after discovery supporting his yet unproven allegations of racial animus. See also Harry v. Marchant, 237 F.3d 1315 (11th Cir.) (\"Indeed, the amended complaint alleges that (1) Normil was a member of a racial minority, (2) Appellees intended to discriminate based on Normil\\'s race, and (3) the discrimination concerned an alleged contractual obligation. Therefore, we reverse the district court\\'s ruling dismissing this claim.\") (emphasis added), vacated en banc, 259 F.3d 1310 (11th Cir.2001), reinstated en banc, 291 F.3d 767 (11th Cir.2002); Hughes v. Ranger, 467 F.2d 6, 10 (4th Cir. 1972) (granting motion to dismiss in a \u00a7 1985(3) action where \"the plaintiffs make no allegations [in their complaint] of any class-based motivation on the part of the defendants\").\\n[9]  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) (2003) provides: \"[i]f two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another, for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; or for the purpose of preventing or hindering the constituted authorities of any State or Territory from giving or securing to all persons within such State or Territory the equal protection of the laws; or if two or more persons conspire to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for President or Vice President, or as a Member of Congress of the United States; or to injure any citizen in person or property on account of such support or advocacy; in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages; occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators.\"\\n[10]  Defendant Jackson has not incorporated by reference the arguments or briefs put forward by the Upsilon Chapter. But Defendant Cunningham has. The Complaint, however, alleged that the individual Defendants cooperated during the alleged unprovoked attack on the Plaintiff. Compl. \u00b6 10. And the Complaint alleged that this conduct was in furtherance of a conspiracy. Id. at \u00b6 25. This puts the individual Defendants on sufficient notice that Plaintiff has alleged that they were members of the alleged conspiracy.\\n[11]  Similarly Plaintiff\\'s Memorandum Brief in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss Filed by Upsilon Chapter nowhere specifically alleges that the Chapter conspired with any individual Defendant or Defendants to deprive Plaintiff of any right. Moreover, in discussing a state law claim, albeit not the \u00a7 1985(3) claim discussed here. Plaintiff took the position that the Chapter merely \"authorized or encouraged\" the actions of the individual Defendants. (Doc. # 43 at 15.) No agreement was alleged.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 2574364}]"},{"id":58803,"date_filed":"2008-01-07","judges":"Carnes, Edmondson, Fay","case_name_full":"Wendell BROWN, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.

Brown, who had been working for MARTA for almost\\n\\ntwenty years, alleges that MARTA terminated his employment due to racial\\n\\ndiscrimination and retaliation based on evidence that MARTA had a practice of\\n\\nretaining and promoting white employees while attempting to get rid of African\\n\\nAmerican employees. After complaining about these practices, Brown was placed\\n\\non the list for termination and was not rehired, despite being told by MARTA\\n\\nmanagement employees and department heads that he was qualified and had an\\n\\nexcellent chance of being rehired. After diligent review of the record, as well as\\n\\ncareful consideration of the briefs and oral argument, we conclude that Brown\\n\\nproduced direct evidence of racial discrimination and a prima facie case for racial\\n\\nretaliation, and reverse and remand the matter for further proceedings.\\n\\n                               Factual Background\\n\\n\\n      Brown, a black male, began to work with MARTA in January 1984. In\\n\\nAugust 2001, Brown received his annual performance review from his then\\n\\nsupervisor, and was rated as \u201cabove standards.\u201d In January 2002, Brown\\n\\ntransferred to the Quality Assurance (\u201cQA\u201d) department and became a QA\\n\\n                                         2\\n\\x0cEngineer. One month later, Brown\u2019s former co-worker, Earl Dendle (\u201cDendle\u201d)\\n\\nbecame his direct supervisor as Acting Manager and a Lead QA Engineer.1\\n\\nDuring Dendle\u2019s eight month tenure as Acting Manager, he hired four people into\\n\\nthe Unit, all white. (Brown Aff. at \u00b6 13; Berry Dep. at 303). Dendle pre-selected\\n\\nthem because, in his words, he wanted things back to \u201cthe good old days,\u201d\\n\\nreferring to the staff that was in place before Ms. Marion Clements took over as\\n\\ndirector.2 (Berry Dep. at 296). This bias is further evidenced by Berry\u2019s testimony\\n\\nthat Dendle assisted at least two of the QA engineers that he wanted to hire by\\n\\ngoing over the questions with them and providing reference materials for them to\\n\\nread before the interview, information which was not available to other candidates.\\n\\n(Berry Dep. at 299-303). In August 2002, Brown received his first annual\\n\\nperformance review from Dendle as a QA Engineer. Brown\u2019s overall rating was\\n\\n\\n\\n       1\\n          In 1992 Brown had worked with Dendle and contends that Dendle developed a dislike\\nfor him at that time, which continued after Dendle became his supervisor. (Brown Aff. at\\n\u00b6\u00b62,7,11). Brown alleges that Dendle\u2019s hostility toward him was racially motivated. (Brown\\nAff. at \u00b611). As Acting Manager, Dendle assigned more projects and reports to Brown than to\\nany other QA employee (Berry Dep. at 50; Brown Aff. at \u00b69), he refused to distribute Brown\u2019s\\nreports in a timely manner which reflected negatively towards Brown (Berry Dep. at 265-266;\\nBrown Aff. at \u00b610) and he was overly critical of the reports submitted by Brown. After Brown\u2019s\\ntermination, Dendle was responsible for these reports, but did not know how to complete them,\\ndid not submit them in a timely manner, and sometimes did not submit them at all. (Berry Dep.\\nat 185-187, 189, 221, 275).\\n       2\\n         Elayne Berry, Manager of the QA department, knew that the candidates were pre-\\nselected because the date of their offer letter was before other candidates were interviewed.\\n(Berry Dep. at 303).\\n\\n                                                 3\\n\\x0c\u201cmeets standards.\u201d3 Brown expressed concern to Udeozo Ogbue (\u201cOgbue\u201d), who\\n\\nwas Dendle\u2019s boss and Executive Director of QA and Safety. (Brown Aff. at \u00b611;\\n\\nWilson Dep. Ex. 5 at 423; Ogbue Dep. at 42). In October 2002, Elayne Berry\\n\\n(\u201cBerry\u201d) became Manager of the QA department, taking over Dendle\u2019s position.\\n\\nShe received complaints from Brown and other QA Engineers that Dendle\u2019s\\n\\nevaluations had been unfair and racially biased, and thus she concluded that it was\\n\\nbetter for her to do all future yearly evaluations of the QA Engineers instead of the\\n\\nsupervisors. (Berry Dep. at 54-56, 59-60). Berry then requested that MARTA\\n\\ninvestigate the allegations against Dendle further, but when this was not done, she\\n\\nremoved Brown from Dendle\u2019s supervision, and transferred him to work under\\n\\nanother Lead Quality Engineer. (Berry Dep. at 54-56). In August 2003, Berry\\n\\nrated Brown as \u201cmeets standard.\u201d (Berry Dep. at Ex. 4-Performance Evaluation).\\n\\n       In the fall of 2003, MARTA developed the Reduction in Force Committee\\n\\n(\u201cRFC\u201d) to implement a reduction in workforce (\u201cRIF\u201d). The first step for a\\n\\ndepartment head to take in determining which employees would be laid off was to\\n\\ndevelop a departmental proposed RIF plan. (Wright Dep., Ex. 11 at MARTA\\n\\n1000). Ralph Eugene Wilson, the head of the Department of Police and Safety\\n\\n\\n\\n       3\\n        According to Brown, this was the average of the \u201cabove standards\u201d evaluation from his\\nprevious supervisor six months earlier and the \u201cbelow standards\u201d evaluation from Dendle.\\n\\n                                              4\\n\\x0cand Quality Assurance (\u201cthe Department\u201d) of which QA was a subset, delegated\\n\\nauthority to Ogbue and Berry to develop this plan. (Wilson Dep. at 17, 25, 31-32).\\n\\nBerry had day-to-day responsibility for the RIF process. (Id. at 47-48, 60-61;\\n\\nOgbue Dep. at 122). Ogbue and Berry proposed the two Lead QA Engineer\\n\\npositions (Grade 20) as the positions to be eliminated from QA. (Wilson Dep. at\\n\\n36, 59, 69; Berry Dep. at 133-134). The two Grade 20 employees holding the\\n\\nLead QA Engineer positions were Dendle and Ray Kassinger, both white. (Berry\\n\\nDep. at 134). Berry submitted these recommendations to the MARTA RIF\\n\\nCommittee. (Berry Dep. at 133-134; Wilson Dep. at 35).\\n\\n      The RIF Committee has the duty: (1) to review RIF plans for compliance\\n\\nwith MARTA policy\/procedure and any applicable laws and regulations, and (2)\\n\\nto concur with the proposed RIF plans from the Departments and route them to the\\n\\nGeneral Manager for approval, or, if the RIF Committee does not recommend\\n\\napproval, to return it to the Department for revision and resubmission. (Wright\\n\\nDep. at 153, Ex. 11 at MARTA 1000). According to Berry, David Wright,\\n\\n(\u201cWright\u201d), chair of the RIF Committee for MARTA, told her in response to her\\n\\nproposed RIF recommendations that it had been expressed in the RIF Committee\\n\\nthat it would \u201cnot be good\u201d to layoff two white employees from a Unit headed by\\n\\nan African American woman. (Berry Dep. at 146,148-149). Wright testified that\\n\\n                                         5\\n\\x0che could not recall such. (Wright Dep. at 199-200). However, Berry was certain.\\n\\n      After reviewing the Department\u2019s proposed RIF plan, the Committee\\n\\nconcluded that the Grade 20 Lead QA Engineer positions would be grouped into a\\n\\ncomparative analysis with the Grade 19 QA Engineer positions. (Wright Dep. at\\n\\n105-106). When she was advised of this plan, Berry informed the RIF Committee\\n\\nthat the Grade 19 and 20 job functions were not similar and thus should not be\\n\\ngrouped together. The RIF Committee overrode her concerns.4 (Berry Dep. at\\n\\n257, 157-158; Wilson Dep. Ex. 3 at MARTA 530-531; Wright Dep. at 113-114.)\\n\\nThe RIF Committee then directed the Department to do a comparative analysis of\\n\\nthe Grade 19 and 20 Engineers pursuant to the procedure outlined in the RIF\\n\\nPolicy. (Berry Dep. at 157-158). Before performing the comparative analysis,\\n\\nBerry informed the RIF Committee that Dendle had not objectively evaluated\\n\\nBrown on his 2002 yearly evaluation and suggested that all of the 2002\\n\\nevaluations completed by Dendle should be disregarded for RIF purposes. The\\n\\nCommittee refused. (Berry Dep. at 157-158, 79-80). Following the analysis, the\\n\\nDepartment recommended Ray Kassinger (white) and William Montgomery\\n\\n(black) for layoff. (Berry Dep. at 158). Brown was still not recommended for\\n\\n\\n      4\\n         MARTA does not recall why the Committee disregarded this information and MARTA\\nhas no documentation to evidence why MARTA decided to lump the Grade 19 and 20 engineers\\ntogether. (Wright Dep. at 192-193).\\n\\n                                            6\\n\\x0clayoff.\\n\\n      During this time, Brown had heard about lunch meetings where MARTA\\n\\nemployees, including Adele Clements, a manager within Brown\u2019s department,\\n\\ndiscussed getting rid of African American employees. (Berry Dep. at 177; Dendle\\n\\nDep. at 98-100). In December 2003, Brown discussed this with Michael Sloan,\\n\\n(\u201cSloan\u201d), MARTA\u2019s Chief Legal Officer and Assistant General Manager.\\n\\n(Brown Aff. at \u00b6 15; see also Dendle Dep. at 103 (testifying that he could not\\n\\nremember one way or the other whether such racial discussions occurred during\\n\\nthe lunch meetings)). Shortly, after this conversation, Sloan instructed the RIF\\n\\nCommittee that Brown could be added to the list for possible layoff. (Berry Dep.\\n\\nat 165, 256). Without any further consultation with the Department, the RIF\\n\\nCommittee engaged in an abridged RIF analysis and concluded that two African\\n\\nAmerican employees would be laid off, including Brown. (MARTA Letter to\\n\\nBrown at 1-2; Wilson Dep. Ex. 3 at MARTA 531; Brown Aff. at \u00b6 16).\\n\\n      Immediately after Brown\u2019s termination, both Wilson and Berry told Brown\\n\\nthat they believed he would be rehired by MARTA and that he was the front\\n\\nrunner for a contract position with MARTA through its general contractor,\\n\\nRegional Transportation Partners (\u201cRTP\u201d). (Brown Aff. at \u00b6\u00b616, 17; Brown Dep.\\n\\nat 33-35). On January 9, 2004, Berry and Ogbue signed Brown\u2019s termination\\n\\n                                         7\\n\\x0crecord specifying that he was terminated due to \u201cStaff reduction\/Lay off,\u201d but his\\n\\n\u201cOverall Job Performance\u201d was satisfactory5, and that they would recommend him\\n\\nfor rehire by the Department and by MARTA. (Berry Dep. at 169; Wilson Dep. at\\n\\nEx. 7). On January 13, 2004, Brown met with Sloan for a second time where he\\n\\ndiscussed again, among other things, his concerns about the lunch meetings.\\n\\n(Brown Aff. at \u00b6 16). The day after this meeting, Ogbue changed Brown\u2019s\\n\\ntermination record from indicating Brown was \u201celigible for rehire\u201d to indicating\\n\\nhe was \u201cnot eligible for rehire.\u201d (Berry Dep. at 170-171). In addition, he changed\\n\\nBrown\u2019s termination record from stating that Brown\u2019s performance was\\n\\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d to stating it was \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d (Id; Wilson Dep. at Exs. 7,8).\\n\\nThen sometime prior to discovery in this case, Brown\u2019s termination record was\\n\\nchanged again to reflect that he was \u201celigible for rehire,\u201d but continued to reflect\\n\\nthat his job performance was unsatisfactory.6 (Wilson Dep. at Ex. 9). In addition,\\n\\neven though MARTA had requested RTP to hire Brown for one of its positions,\\n\\nBerry testified that Mr. Ogbue went to RTP directly and asked that they not fill\\n\\n\\n\\n       5\\n        For purposes of the summary judgment, MARTA does not dispute that Brown\u2019s\\nperformance was satisfactory. (MARTA\u2019s pleading showing authorities for summary judgment,\\npg. 9).\\n       6\\n          Wilson, Ogbue, and Berry, the MARTA employees responsible for filling out the form,\\ntestified that they had never seen this third version before they were deposed. (Berry Dep. at\\n173; Wilson Dep. at 121; Ogbue Dep. at 159-160).\\n\\n                                               8\\n\\x0cthat request. (Berry Dep. at 103-105).\\n\\n      After his termination, Brown applied for eight positions with MARTA, two\\n\\nbefore filing his EEOC charge. As to these first two positions, Brown received\\n\\nnotice from MARTA that he was qualified for one (Director of Wayside\\n\\nMaintenance), but not the other (Superintendent-Rail Line). (Berry Dep. at 194).\\n\\nWith regards to the six other positions Brown applied for after filing the EEOC\\n\\ncharge, Brown received notice that he was qualified for two positions, Contract\\n\\nProfessional\u2013Safety & Quality Assurance and Contract Employee\u2013 Safety\\n\\nCertification Engineer. (Brown Aff. at \u00b625). On March 4, 2005, Brown filed an\\n\\nemployment discrimination action against MARTA claiming racial discrimination\\n\\nand retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42\\n\\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e, et seq, 42 U.S.C. \u00a71981 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, respectively, as\\n\\nwell as a state law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against\\n\\nMARTA. The district court granted MARTA\u2019s motion for summary judgment\\n\\nbecause Brown failed to establish a prima facie case for either racial\\n\\ndiscrimination or retaliation. This appeal followed.\\n\\n                                     Discussion\\n\\n      \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary\\n\\njudgment de novo, viewing the record and drawing all reasonable inferences in the\\n\\n                                          9\\n\\x0clight most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d Patton v. Triad Guar. Ins. Corp.,\\n\\n277 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir. 2002).\\n\\n                            A. The Discrimination Claim\\n\\n\\n      If \u201ca plaintiff produces direct evidence of a discriminatory motive, and the\\n\\ntrier of facts accepts this testimony the ultimate issue of discrimination is proven.\u201d\\n\\nEvans v. McClain of Georgia, Inc., 131 F.3d 957, 962 (11th Cir. 1997); Trotter v.\\n\\nBoard of Trustees of Univ. Of Ala., 91 F.3d 1449, 1453 (11th Cir. 1996) (\u201cWhen\\n\\nthere is direct evidence that discrimination was a motivating factor in the\\n\\nchallenged employment decision, the appropriate analysis is different from that\\n\\nemployed in a case where only circumstantial evidence is available.\u201d). \u201c[I]n cases\\n\\nof discrimination proved by direct evidence, it is incorrect to rely on the\\n\\nMcDonnell Douglas test because, while circumstantial evidence is used to create\\n\\nan inference of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas, no such inference is\\n\\nrequired in the case of direct evidence.\u201d Bass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, 256 F.3d\\n\\n1095, 1104 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Taylor v. Runyon, 175 F.3d 861, 867 n.2\\n\\n(11th Cir. 1999).\\n\\n      Brown\u2019s Department RIF Committee recommended two unit employees\\n\\nwho should be laid off. They were both white. Thereafter, Wright, the chairman\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          10\\n\\x0cof the RIF Committee for MARTA, told Berry, the co-chair of the RIF Committee\\n\\nfor the Department of Police and Safety and Quality Assurance that during a\\n\\nmeeting of the RIF Committee it had been expressed that it would \u201cnot be good\u201d\\n\\nto layoff two white employees from a Unit headed by an African American\\n\\nwoman. (Berry Dep. at 146, 148-149).7 Only then did the RIF Committee\\n\\ndetermine that two African American employees, including Brown would be laid\\n\\noff instead of the two whites previously recommended. (Berry Dep. at 146, 148-\\n\\n149). This is strong direct evidence that racial bias was involved in MARTA\u2019s\\n\\ndecision to terminate Brown\u2019s employment. This is a discussion held between\\n\\nsenior employees of MARTA directly involved in the decision making process.\\n\\nSee Bass, 256 F.3d at 1105; Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., 196\\n\\nF.3d 1354, 1358 (11th Cir. 1999) (\u201c[O]nly the most blatant remarks, whose intent\\n\\ncould be nothing other than to discriminate on the basis of [race] . . . constitute\\n\\ndirect evidence of discrimination.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).\\n\\n\\n\\n       7\\n         This statement constitutes an admission by a party opponent because under Fed. R.\\nEvid. 801(d)(2)(D), \u201ca statement by [a] party\u2019s agent or servant concerning a matter within the\\nscope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship, . . . is deemed\\nan admission by a party opponent and is excluded from the definition of hearsay.\u201d See City of\\nTuscaloosa v. Harcros Chemicals, Inc., 158 F.3d 548, 557 (11th Cir. 1998). Furthermore,\\n\u201cbecause Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D) does not define the term [\u2018]agent,[\u2019] we must assume that\\nCongress intended to refer to general common law principles of agency when it used the term.\\nAt common law, senior officers of a corporation normally are agents and servants of the\\ncorporation.\u201d Id. at 558 n.9.\\n\\n                                               11\\n\\x0c      Moreover, even without that direct evidence, clearly, Brown has produced\\n\\nsufficient evidence, which if believed, would establish a prima facie case for\\n\\ndiscrimination pursuant to the McDonnell Douglas factors. \u201cTo state a prima\\n\\nfacie case of racial discrimination [under McDonnell Douglas], a plaintiff must\\n\\nshow (i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified\\n\\nfor a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his\\n\\nqualifications, he was rejected, and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position\\n\\nremained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of\\n\\ncomplainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d Terry v. Cook, 866 F.2d 373, 379 (11th Cir. 1989)\\n\\n(quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817,\\n\\n1824 (1973). \u201cThe burden then . . . shift[s] to the employer to articulate some\\n\\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d McDonnell\\n\\nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802.\\n\\n      The first prong of the test is clearly satisfied because Brown is an African\\n\\nAmerican. The second prong is also satisfied in that upon his termination both\\n\\nBerry and Wilson informed Brown that he had an excellent chance of being\\n\\nrehired by MARTA, and that he was the front runner for a contract position with\\n\\nMARTA through its general contractor. (Brown Aff. at \u00b6\u00b616, 17; Brown Dep. at\\n\\n33-35). In addition, the record evidence shows that MARTA determined Brown\\n\\n                                           12\\n\\x0cwas qualified for a position for which he had applied before filing the EEOC\\n\\ncomplaint\u2013Director of Wayside Maintenance\u2013and two positions for which he had\\n\\napplied after filing the EEOC complaint\u2013Contract Professional\u2013Safety & Quality\\n\\nAssurance and Contract Employee\u2013Safety Certification Engineer. (Brown Aff. at\\n\\n\u00b625; see Escandon Aff.; Harris Aff.).\\n\\n       Likewise, the third prong is satisfied. Brown applied for a total of eight\\n\\npositions after his termination and was never rehired, despite qualifying for at least\\n\\nthree positions. Finally, the fourth prong is satisfied because after rejecting\\n\\nBrown, MARTA continued to seek other applicants and ultimately hired other\\n\\npeople for the positions for which Brown was qualified.\\n\\n       This record includes sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case for\\n\\nracial discrimination and therefore genuine issues of material facts precluding the\\n\\nentry of a summary judgment.\\n\\n                                   B. The Retaliation Claim\\n\\n       To establish a prima facie showing of retaliation under Title VII,8 a plaintiff\\n\\nmust demonstrate: \u201c(1) that [he] engaged in a statutorily protected expression; (2)\\n\\n       8\\n         Title VII considers it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate\\nagainst an employee \u201cbecause he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment\\npractice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\\nany manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\\n2000e-3(a).\\n\\n                                                 13\\n\\x0cthat [he] suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) that there is some causal\\n\\nrelation between the two events.\u201d Cooper v. Southern Co., 390 F.3d 695 (11th Cir.\\n\\n2004).\\n\\n       The first prong of the test is satisfied in this case. In Little v. United\\n\\nTechnologies, this Court held that in order to be a statutorily protected expression,\\n\\n\u201cthe opposition must be directed at an unlawful employment practice of an\\n\\nemployer, not an act of discrimination by a private individual.\u201d 103 F.3d 956, 959\\n\\n(11th Cir. 1997). The district court held that Brown has not made such a showing\\n\\nand, thus, his complaint about the Pizza Hut meetings was not protected activity.\\n\\nWe disagree. In December 2003, Brown discussed with Michael Sloan,\\n\\nMARTA\u2019s Chief Legal Officer and Assistant General Manager, that he had heard\\n\\nabout lunch meetings where MARTA employees discussed getting rid of African\\n\\nAmerican employees. (Brown Aff. at \u00b6 15). This case, unlike Little, opposes the\\n\\nroutine discriminatory practice of management employees, particularly Dendle and\\n\\nClements\u2019, and not action or comments from co-workers to co-workers. This\\n\\nevidence accounts for Brown\u2019s state of mind9 because he was concerned that\\n\\n       9\\n         The evidence that the lunch meetings included discussions of getting rid of black\\nemployees and retaining and promoting whites is Berry\u2019s deposition testimony about what\\nClements and Dendle told her. This is not hearsay because it need not be offered for the truth of\\nthe matter asserted. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c); U.S. v. Schlei, 122 F.3d 944 (11th Cir. 1997)\\n(Evidence regarding witness\u2019 testimony at her deposition was not hearsay where testimony was\\noffered to demonstrate defendant\u2019s state of mind.). Whether or not it is true, it was the reason\\n\\n                                               14\\n\\x0cdiscriminatory practices were going on. (Berry Dep. at 177).\\n\\n       This Court in Little, stated that even if conduct complained about is not\\n\\nunlawful, a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII\\n\\nif he had \u201can objectively reasonable belief that he opposed an unlawful\\n\\nemployment practice.\u201d 103 F.3d at 960. \u201cA plaintiff must not only show that he\\n\\nsubjectively (that is, in good faith) believed that his employer was engaged in\\n\\nunlawful employment practices, but also that his belief was objectively reasonable\\n\\nin light of the facts and record presented.\u201d Id.\\n\\n       There is ample evidence to show that Brown had a reasonable basis for a\\n\\nsubjective good faith belief that he took part in statutorily protected expression.\\n\\nSee Clover v. Total Sys. Serv., Inc., 176 F.3d 1346, 1351 (11th Cir. 1999)\\n\\n(protected expression element satisfied where court had no reason to doubt\\n\\nplaintiff did not have a good faith, reasonable belief he was engaging in statutorily\\n\\nprotected expression). In fact, Brown submitted a supplemental affidavit\\n\\nexplaining that he believed he was opposing an act of unlawful racial\\n\\ndiscrimination. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C), Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b) (district court\\n\\nmay consider additional evidence upon receipt of Magistrate Judge\u2019s\\n\\nrecommendation). After reviewing the facts, Brown\u2019s good faith belief was also\\n\\n\\nBrown went to Sloan to complain.\\n\\n                                          15\\n\\x0cobjectively reasonable because a detached individual could easily have interpreted\\n\\nthis cumulative evidence as an indication of an unlawful employment practice.\\n\\n      The second prong of the test is also satisfied because Brown suffered\\n\\nadverse employment action after his complaint. According to the Supreme Court,\\n\\na \u201cplaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the\\n\\nchallenged action materially adverse[.]\u201d Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v.\\n\\nWhite, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006) (noting that the standard is\\n\\nphrased in \u201cgeneral terms because the significance of any given act of retaliation\\n\\nwill often depend upon the particular circumstances. Context matters.\u201d) (emphasis\\n\\nadded). The Court has stated that \u201cin this context means it well might have\\n\\ndissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of\\n\\ndiscrimination.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Shortly after Brown\u2019s\\n\\ndiscussion with Sloan, MARTA\u2019s Chief Legal Officer and Assistant General\\n\\nManager, Sloan instructed the MARTA RIF Committee that Brown could be\\n\\nadded to the list for possible layoff. Then, a day after Brown\u2019s second meeting\\n\\nwith Sloan, Ogbue changed Brown\u2019s termination record from indicating he was\\n\\n\u201celigible for rehire\u201d to indicating he was \u201cnot eligible for rehire.\u201d Ogbue also\\n\\nchanged Brown\u2019s termination record from stating that Brown\u2019s performance was\\n\\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d to stating it was \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d\\n\\n                                          16\\n\\x0c      Taking this in context, we believe that MARTA\u2019s changes to Brown\u2019s\\n\\nemployment record constituted significant adverse action. Brown was terminated\\n\\nafter almost twenty years of employment with MARTA, and upon his termination\\n\\ntwo MARTA management employees informed him that he had an excellent\\n\\nchance of being rehired by MARTA and even identified a specific position for\\n\\nhim. (Brown Aff. at \u00b6\u00b616, 17; Brown Dep. at 33-35). We believe a jury could\\n\\nconclude that had Brown known that his complaint of discrimination would lead\\n\\nto his employment record being changed to \u201cnot eligible for rehire\u201d and\/or\\n\\n\u201cperformance unsatisfactory\u201d he would have been dissuaded from making such a\\n\\ncomplaint, as would any other reasonable person.\\n\\n      To satisfy the third prong for retaliation, \u201ca plaintiff need only show that the\\n\\nprotected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated.\u201d Brungart v.\\n\\nBellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation\\n\\nmarks omitted). \u201cAt a minimum, a plaintiff must generally establish that the\\n\\nemployer was actually aware of the protected expression at the time it took the\\n\\nadverse employment action.\u201d Clover, 176 F.3d at 1354; Raney v. Vinson Guard\\n\\nServ., 120 F.3d 1192, 1197 (11th Cir. 1997). This awareness may be established\\n\\neither by direct or circumstantial evidence.\u201d Clover, 176 F.3d at 1354; Bass, 256\\n\\nF.3d at 1119 (stating that to establish a causal connection, the decision maker's\\n\\n\\n                                         17\\n\\x0cawareness of the protected activity might be established by circumstantial\\n\\nevidence, such as \u201cclose temporal proximity between the protected activity and the\\n\\nadverse action\u201d); Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir. 2004) (\u201c[I]n\\n\\nthe absence of other evidence tending to show causation\u201d a party might establish\\n\\ncausation by showing a very close temporal proximity between the protected\\n\\nactivity and the adverse action).\\n\\n      Brown has satisfied the third prong. Brown cited record evidence that\\n\\nshortly after his first complaint to Sloan, Sloan instructed the MARTA RIF\\n\\nCommittee that Brown could be added to the list for layoff. (Berry Dep. at 165\\n\\nand 256). Then unfavorable changes to his employment record were made one\\n\\nday after Brown\u2019s second complaint to Sloan. All of this was done after Berry and\\n\\nWilson had indicated to Brown that he was the front runner for a contract position\\n\\nwith MARTA. (Brown Aff. at \u00b6\u00b616, 17; Brown Dep. at 33-35). In addition, there\\n\\nis evidence that after Brown\u2019s conversation with Sloan, MARTA, through Ogbue,\\n\\nconvinced its general contractor to reject Brown for a job. (Berry Dep. at 103-\\n\\n105). Finally, after his termination, Brown applied for a total of eight positions\\n\\nwith MARTA, and was never rehired. We conclude that there is a sufficient basis\\n\\nto find that MARTA\u2019s refusal to rehire Brown was not \u201cwholly unrelated\u201d to his\\n\\ncomplaints of discrimination. Thus, we believe that Brown has established a\\n\\n\\n                                         18\\n\\x0cprima facie case for retaliation as well.\\n\\n                                     Conclusion\\n\\n      Because Brown has established a prima facie case for both racial\\n\\ndiscrimination and retaliation, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s order granting\\n\\nsummary judgment. The summary judgment is VACATED and the matter\\n\\nREMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            19\\n\\x0c\", 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 58803}]"},{"id":333944,"date_filed":"1976-03-04","judges":"Heaney, Matthes, Ross","case_name_full":"12 Fair empl.prac.cas. 397, 11 Empl.

Garrett alleged her employment with Mobil was terminated because of her race (black) and because she asserted her rights under the statute.  The district court denied relief reported at 395 F.Supp. 117 (W.D.Mo.1975).  In this court Garrett has dropped the allegation that she was discharged because of her race, but appeals on the ground that she was fired for protesting racial discrimination which she in good faith believed Mobil was practicing.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      Garrett was hired on August 18, 1969, to work in Mobil's Credit Card Center in Kansas City.  The Center bills and collects credit card accounts throughout the country.  In October, 1969, Garrett transferred to the Center's incoming mail room.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      In early February, Garrett's supervisor, Jerry Eklund, told her that her work was not up to standard and she would have to improve.  She complained about the way the mail room was being run and stated her belief that she was the victim of racial discrimination.  Eklund attempted to explain the promotions of some white women whom Garrett felt should not have been promoted ahead of her.  On February 13, 1970, Eklund discussed an employee appraisal with plaintiff in which he indicated that she barely met the requirements of her job.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      On March 11, 1970, she again spoke with Eklund, questioning the accuracy of her unfavorable work records and asking for better assignments.  Eklund indicated that she would not be assigned to other work until her performance improved.  Shortly thereafter Eklund was promoted to another department.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      On March 18, Garrett discussed her unfavorable February appraisal with her new supervisor, Beverly Lake.  Lake explained to her that her work was still not satisfactory.  After discussing her appraisal with Lake, and without Lake's permission or knowledge, Garrett left her work station at least twice and attempted to see Mr. Fox, the manager of the Center, and the Center Manager of Operations, Mr. Fish.  Mr. Fox was not in, and on both occasions when she attempted to see Fish, Fish's secretary told her that he was in a meeting, and she should contact her supervisor.  Later on the same day, Garrett left her work station a third time without her supervisor's knowledge and went to Mr. Ittel's office.  Ittel was the Center's Employee Relations Manager, and was conferring with Beverly Lake, Garrett's supervisor.  Ittel's secretary told the plaintiff she should return to her work station, to which Garrett replied: 'I'm not removing my ass from this office until I see Mr. Ittel.'  At this point Lake came out of Ittel's office and persuaded Garrett to return to her work area.  The same day Lake informed the plaintiff that the proper procedure to follow if she wished to speak to superiors in the Center was to ask her supervisor to make an appointment.  Garrett said she did not realize that was the correct procedure until Lake explained it.  Garrett told her supervisor that she was fed up with the way the incoming mail room was run, especially the way her supervisors watched her and picked on her.  Lake discussed this complaint, and felt that Garrett was satisfied at the conclusion of their conference.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      On April 22, 1970, Betty Garrett spoke with Sandy Mitchell, Supervisor of Accounting and Office Services, during her coffee break.  This was without her supervisor's knowledge.  Her complaint was again about work assignments and her February evaluation.  Mitchell apparently reported this to Beverly Lake.  Lake met with the plaintiff, again emphasizing that this was not the proper procedure for registering grievances, and told her that she should speak to her supervisor first about any complaints.  Garrett was also told by her supervisor that she was not given other work assignments because of her prior unsatisfactory appraisal, but a new one would soon be prepared.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      April 29, 1970, a new employee appraisal, prepared by Lake, was discussed with the plaintiff.  It indicated she now fully met job requirements, although her 'attendance and punctuality need(ed) some improving;' but the 'factor most needing improvement' was '(t)endency to be untactful.'  At this April 29 conference Garrett inquired about a raise, but was not satisfied by Lake's explanation of the criteria.  At that point Lake made an appointment for the two of them to see the Manager of the Accounting and Office Services Department, who confirmed the supervisor's explanation.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      At the end of April and early in May, plaintiff began to receive other work assignments, which she had sought earlier.  May 4, 1970, a raise to be effective May 25 was approved for her.  She testified at trial that she knew she was up for a raise but was never told it had been approved.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      On June 3, 1970, without her supervisor's knowledge, Garrett and several other black women left the mail room and went to Mr. Ittel's office, where he was meeting with another executive of the company.  Plaintiff and the others demanded to see Mr. Ittel; he came out of his office and asked them to leave.  The other women left when asked but he had to repeat his request before Garrett would leave.  Later that day Ittel met with Garrett and the Manager of the Accounting and Office Services Department, Frank Doan.  Garrett complained that she and other blacks in the mail room were being discriminated against, and was told that this would be investigated.  For the next two days Doan conducted an investigation, during which all of the other mail room employees were interviewed.  As a result of his investigation Mobil concluded there was no racial discrimination in the mail room.  On Monday, June 8, Garrett was not at work due to illness.  After consulting with others, Doan decided to fire her.  He was unable to reach her by telephone, and therefore the following telegram was sent.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      I have been unable to reach you by phone today so I as sending you this telegram.  I have completed my investigation of your charges of alleged (sic) discrimination made last Wednesday, June 3 and find them unfounded.  Your employment with Mobil Oil Corp. has been terminated effective 6--8--70.  The reason for termination is your repeated violation of by-passing your supervisv (sic) in presenting complaints to management and disrupting work. * * *\\n    \\n    F. M. Doan--D.  (sic) H. Lake\\n    \\n      11\\n      At trial the defendant also stated plaintiff was fired because she repeatedly left her work area without permission.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      The case was tried without a jury, and the district judge found the facts to be as related above.  He also found that plaintiff was not discharged because of race or her complaints of racial discrimination,1 but that she was properly discharged for the reasons stated by the defendant: leaving her work area, disobeying regulations in presenting her complaints to management, and disrupting operations.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Garrett now contends the findings in the district court were clearly erroneous and that her conduct was not disruptive as a matter of law.2 She contends that her attempts to see top management were justified because her supervisors had ignored her complaints of racial discrimination and requests to see higher ranking officials.  Garrett also points out that the employee handbook she was given when she began at Mobil states: 'While your immediate supervisor should be the first person you contact to resolve a problem, you may take it to higher levels of supervision if your Supervisor's decision does not satisfy you.'  She denies ever being told by Lake that she would have to go through her supervisor and make an appointment to see higher ranking officials.  Her second argument is that she was not disruptive because she destroyed no property, assaulted no one and broke no law.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      In a Title VII case the plaintiff must initially establish a prima facie case that defendant has violated the Act.  The burden then shifts to defendant to show a valid reason for the action, and plaintiff is then afforded an opportunity to show that defendant's asserted reason is a mere pretext.  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 1825, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, 677, 678 (1973).  We assume for purposes of this opinion that Garrett met her initial burden of establishing a prima facie case; however, the judge's findings--that she was discharged for the reasons stated by Mobil and these reasons were not pretext are supported by substantial evidence and we cannot say they were clearly erroneous.  Gillin v. Federal Paper Board Co., 479 F.2d 97, 101 (2d Cir. 1973); see Green v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 528 F.2d 1102 (8th Cir. 1976); King v. Yellow Freight System, 523 F.2d 879, 882 (8th Cir. 1975); Naraine v. Western Electric Co., Inc., 507 F.2d 590, 593 (8th Cir. 1974); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).  Certainly an employer can fire a worker who refuses to obey reasonable regulations, leaves the work area without permission, and barges in on conferences and meetings of managerial personnel. The testimony of her supervisors contradicted her allegations that her complaints of racial discrimination and requests to see her superiors were ignored, and the district judge believed these witnesses instead of Garrett.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      Garrett's argument that her conduct was not disruptive as a matter of law is not persuasive.  Actions which are neither illegal nor physically damaging to persons and property may be disruptive, and constitute valid reason for discharge.  See, e.g., Smith v. Universal Services, Inc., 454 F.2d 154, 156 (5th Cir. 1972).  We agree that plaintiff's conduct was unnecessarily disruptive to efficient operations of the defendant.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         Garrett no longer contends that her employment was terminated because of race, so we have not closely examined that issue.  We note in passing, however, that the evidence introduced concerning the hiring, salary and promotions of blacks in the mail room compared to whites would seem to negate any inference of discrimination.  See Garrett v. Mobil Oil Corp., 395 F.Supp. 117, 123 (W.D.Mo.1975)\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         Garrett also contends that the case was unduly delayed.  We have previously addressed this issue in Lowry v. Whitaker Cable Corp., 472 F.2d 1210, 1211 (8th Cir. 1973), and we adhere to the views expressed therein.  However, the plaintiff does not show how she may have been injured by this delay, and we do not regard it as a basis for relief\\n      \\n    \\n    \", 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 333944}]"},{"id":347113,"date_filed":"1977-09-02","judges":null,"case_name_full":"15 Fair empl.prac.cas. 671, 14 Empl.

(Greyhound or the Company), International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (the International) and Local Lodge 570, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO (the Local)2 with racial discrimination in Greyhound\\'s St. Petersburg, Florida, facility against blacks in employment, promotion and furlough (lay-off) practices.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      The trial court denied motions to dismiss the amended complaint and other pretrial motions, and held a bench trial on the issues raised by the amended complaint and the amended answers of Greyhound and the Union as merged into and restated by the Pre-trial Stipulation.  The court entered judgments on the merits for each of the defendants, and filed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law which supported the judgments.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Both by appropriate motions and by their amended answers all defendants raised statute of limitation defenses.  All were disallowed by the trial court.  For reasons briefly indicated below, we conclude that both &#167; 1981 claims were barred by the applicable Statute of Limitations.  We further conclude that the court should have dismissed the Title VII claims for failure to prove subject matter jurisdiction, as urged by motions filed by all defendants at the close of the evidence.  We therefore affirm the judgments below without reaching the merits.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      A &#167; 1981 claim was asserted against each defendant, while, under the issues as finally framed for trial, the &#167; 2000e-5 violation was charged against the two Unions only.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      On December 9, 1971, because of a reduction in force, Shaw was furloughed from his mechanic classification with Greyhound.  He had held the classification since 1963, following since 1955 employment as a Cleaner, a lower classification.  A job as mechanic was added by Greyhound in early August 1972, was opened to bids, and was awarded on August 15, 1972, to Max M. Daniel, a former white mechanic employee who had been furloughed on October 4, 1971.  The position of Greyhound and the Unions at trial was that the award to Daniel was required by the collective bargaining agreement between Greyhound and the International, under the terms of which Daniel was the senior bidder.3 The trial court\\'s upholding of this contention was the undergirding for its decision on the merits.\\n    \\n    I. THE &#167; 1981 CLAIMS\\n    \\n      7\\n      The original complaint in this action was filed October 17, 1973, alleging racial discrimination in the August 1972 denial of promotion to Shaw, both under Title VII and under &#167; 1981.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Since Shaw had not filed charges against Greyhound with the EEOC, a jurisdictional prerequisite to an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5, the Title VII claim against Greyhound was properly dismissed by the district court, as conceded here by appellant.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      As &#167; 1981 contains no statute of limitations, we have held that federal courts will follow the most \"closely analogous\" state limitation statute.  Franks v. Bowen Transport, 495 F.2d 398 (5th Cir. 1974).  We held in Johnson v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, 491 F.2d 1364, 1379 (5th Cir. 1974) that Florida Statutes &#167; 95.11(7)(b)\\'s4 one year proscription was the applicable Florida limitation statute in &#167; 1981 employment discrimination cases.  As more than one year elapsed between the denial of promotion to Shaw on August 15, 1972 and the filing of suit on October 17, 1973, the &#167; 1981 claim as to Greyhound was time-barred.5\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      The &#167; 1981 action as to the Unions was likewise brought out of time under Fla.  Statutes &#167; 95.11(7)(b).  The rule prevailing in this circuit, prior to Johnson v. American Railway Express6 was that the timely filing of a Title VII complaint with the EEOC tolled7 the Statute of Limitations as to a corresponding &#167; 1981 claim.  See Guerra v. Manchester Terminal Corp., 498 F.2d 641 (5th Cir. 1974); Boudreaux v. Baton Rouge Marine Contracting Co., 437 F.2d 1011 (5th Cir. 1971).  But in Johnson the Supreme Court held that the statute of limitations applicable to an action under &#167; 1981 is not tolled during the pendency of proceedings before the EEOC, since for purposes of limitation the two types of claim are separate and distinct.  Johnson left unanswered whether its holding was to be applied retroactively.8 The answer for this circuit has been supplied: Johnson does apply retroactively.  See Williams v. Phil Rich Fan Manufacturing Co., Inc., 552 F.2d 596 (5th Cir. 1977), Dupree v. Hutchins Brothers, 521 F.2d 236 (5th Cir. 1975).\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Under retroactive application of Johnson, the one year Florida limitation was a bar to the &#167; 1981 claim against both the International and Local Lodge 570.\\n    \\n    II. THE TITLE VII CLAIMS\\n    \\n      12\\n      The collective bargaining agreement (and prior agreements) under which Daniel was given preference in filling the mechanic position at St. Petersburg in August 1972, was entered into between the International Union and Greyhound Motor Lines-East, a Division of Greyhound Motor Lines, Inc. Local Lodge 1831 was the local union designated to represent Greyhound\\'s employees at its St. Petersburg, Florida maintenance facility, until its membership was merged into Local 570 in June 1973.  Prior to that time, Local 570 was a stranger to Greyhound and to its St. Petersburg operation.  (Findings of Fact of trial court Nos. 8 and 9, App. 251).\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Local Lodge 570, along with the International and Greyhound, was named as a defendant in the court suit below.  Local 1831 was not sued.  Both the original complaint and the amended complaint alleged in Paragraph XII that:\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      \"On January 9, 1973, Plaintiffs filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging violations by the Defendants union of Plaintiffs\\' rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. 2000 (2000e) et seq. On or about July 26, 1973 Plaintiffs were advised that the charges were still pending investigation by the Commission, but that since 180 days had elapsed from the filing of the charges, Plaintiffs were entitled to initiate a civil action in the United States District Court as provided by 42 U.S.C.A. 2000e-5(f) of the Act.\"  (underscoring ours).\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      The Answers of both Local Lodge 570 and the International Union joined issue as to these averments:\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      \"12.  The allegations of Paragraph XII are denied.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      Neither Union defendant receded from this position throughout the course of subsequent pleadings and pretrial statements of position.  The point was reiterated by each on motions for directed verdict at the close of the trial, supported by detailed written memoranda, asserting plaintiff\\'s failure to prove jurisdiction under Title VII by proof of timely filing before the EEOC of the charges of discrimination asserted in the lawsuit.  On this basis each asserts that since the sole proof at trial of filing of the contents of the claimed charges before the EEOC was the \"Right to Sue\" letters introduced in evidence, jurisdiction was never established and the respective motions for directed verdicts were due to be granted by the trial court.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      We agree that the allegations of Paragraph XII were jurisdictional, and that if plaintiff Shaw did not discharge his burden of proving them, the complaint was due to be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      The filing of a charge with the EEOC is one of two conditions precedent or jurisdictional prerequisites to suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq. Beverly v. Lone Star Lead Const. Corp., 437 F.2d 1136, 1139 (5th Cir. 1971); Miller v. International Paper Co., 408 F.2d 283, 291 (5th Cir. 1969).\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      The other jurisdictional prerequisite is proof of receipt of the statutory notice of right to sue.  Beverly v. Lone Star Lead Const. Corp., supra; Miller v. International Paper Co., supra; Carr v. Conoco Plastics, Inc., 423 F.2d 57 (5th Cir. 1970).\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      The only proofs plaintiff offered at trial were the filing of the two \"Right to Sue\" letters, one as to International Association of Machinists, and the other as to Local 1831, not as to Local 570.  Plaintiff did not testify as to filing any charge with EEOC, or when he had filed any charge, or the subject of the discrimination asserted (assuming that charges were filed).\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      Both Union defendants were entitled to directed verdicts or some equivalent relief for failure to establish jurisdiction before the district court.  The district court held as a matter of law that:\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      The failure of defendant (1) International or (2) Local 570 to object to the introduction of a \"right to sue letter\" establishes that the jurisdictional prerequisites to bringing this action under 42 U.S.C. 2000e, et seq., were established as to them.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      Conclusions of Law, 3, App. p. 257.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      This was an acceptance by the district court of the plaintiff-appellant\\'s position below (and before us) that \"a prima facie case of the Court\\'s jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties was made when the Plaintiff introduced into evidence his notice of right to sue letter from EEOC as to both defendants and the business manager testified that Local 570 assumed the responsibility for the business affairs of Local 1831 when it merged with said local.\"  Plaintiff\\'s memorandum filed November 22, 1974, Vol.  I, Appendix 228, 231-32.9 The \"Right to Sue Letters\" were introduced in evidence as Plaintiff\\'s Exhibits 52 (as to the International) and 53 (as to Local 1831). While no objection was made, counsel for the Unions reserved objections as to the materiality of the exhibits.10 The slight difference in the facts as to the two Union defendants11 is of no import.  Jurisdiction over neither defendant under Title 42, U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq. was ever established.  As courts of limited jurisdiction, neither the district court nor this court is empowered to make any assumptions as to the filing or the contents of any complaints with the EEOC.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Our holding means that the judgments below are affirmed, albeit on different grounds than those relied on by the district court.12\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      AFFIRMED.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         Ula Cutliff and Jack Fletcher, whose claims were dismissed with prejudice during the trial.  They have not appealed\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         The complaint also named Max M. Daniel, a white member of the Union and a Greyhound employee, as a defendant.  Daniel\\'s motion for directed verdict was granted at the close of the evidence at trial.  This ruling is not attacked on appeal\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Daniel and another white employee, Johnston, bid for the position.  Shaw did not, but had he done so, he would have been unsuccessful, as the trial judge held, and the parties agree\\n        The contract provided that classification seniority would build only for the time the employee was in the classification.  When Daniel was furloughed in October, 1971, since he had no seniority in any other classification, he worked elsewhere, so that under the contract his seniority as mechanic continued to build.  Both Johnston and Shaw had seniority over Daniel as mechanics when they were furloughed.  However, when laid off each of them \"bumped down\" to a lower position, Johnston as a fueler, Shaw as a bus cleaner, so that their seniority as mechanics remained the same as it was when they were laid off, and thus Daniel was senior to each of them when the new job opened in August 1972.  The trial court found that as of that date Shaw had seniority as a mechanic of 8 years and 9 months, Johnston of 8 years and 8 months, and Daniel of 9 years and one month.\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         Florida Statutes &#167; 95.11(7)(b) as it appeared prior to amendment January 1, 1975 read as follows:\\n        \"95.11 . . . Actions other than those for the recovery of real property can only be commenced as follows:\\n        (7) WITHIN ONE YEAR.\\n        (b) Suits for the recovery of wages, overtime, or damages and penalties accruing under laws respecting the payment of wages and overtime.\"\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         We reject as baseless Shaw\\'s contention that the claimed discrimination was a \"continuing violation\".  The effect of the violation continued, but clearly the violation itself, if it occurred, was on or before the date of the award of the position to Daniel, August 15, 1972.  See Guerra v. Manchester Terminal, 498 F.2d 641 (5th Cir. 1974)\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         Johnson v. American Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975)\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         The question of tolling is important here.  According to Shaw\\'s Amended Complaint, Title VII violation charges were filed before the EEOC on January 9, 1973, against the Union defendants.  This date was within the one year Florida limitation period and within the 180 day time limit for filing charges, &#167; 2000e-5.  Actually, no charges were ever brought by Shaw against Local 570 before the EEOC.  That Local represented no bargaining unit of Greyhound employees, at St. Petersburg or elsewhere until Local 1831 was merged into it in June of 1973, after the events charged in plaintiff Shaw\\'s complaint, but before suit was filed\\n        The charges were pending before the EEOC when suit was instituted October 23, 1973. \"Right to Sue\" letters as to the International and as to Local Lodge 1831 (but not as to Local Lodge 570) issued by EEOC July 26, 1973 were received in evidence at trial without objection under stipulation.  This subject is dealt with more fully in the text, Part II of this opinion, infra.\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         Other than inferentially, by its application of the no tolling rule to the plaintiff-petitioner before the Court, Johnson\\n      \\n      \\n        9\\n         The argument was elaborated as follows:\\n        \"The Defendants argue that the filing of a charge with EEOC is a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing a suit under 42 U.S.C. 2000e.  The Plaintiff agrees with this statement.  However, the question then becomes what proof is necessary to establish a prima facie case that the charges were filed with EEOC.\\n        Under 42 U.S.C. 2000e et. seq., EEOC is given the responsibility to determine whether the charge is timely or that local and state remedies have been exhausted.  Thus the notice of right to sue letter from EEOC is prima facie evidence that a timely charge was filed with EEOC.  If the defendants wish to rebutt this prima facie case they have the responsibility of coming forward with additional evidence.\\n        Furthermore, in this case the defendants with the Courts approval in effect stipulated that the Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case of jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. 2000e when they let the Plaintiff introduce into evidence the notice of right to sue letters without establishing a foundation for their introduction.  To say otherwise would make it impossible for opposing counsel to stipulate to the admission of evidence, if the facts essential to the admissibility of the evidence is not admitted.  In this case, if the letter had been stipulated into evidence, plaintiff would have showed that he filed charges with EEOC and that after 180 days he applied for and received his notice of right to sue letter.\\n        Local 570 further argues that no charges were filed against it with EEOC and it is not liable for the acts of Local 1831.\\n        It is true that no charge was filed against Local 570, but a charge was filed against Local 1831 and pursuant to an agreement between the two Locals they merged, and Local 570 assumed the responsibility for the business affairs of Local 1831.  Thus their argument that they are not liable is of no moment.  If it were otherwise, the courts jurisdiction would be frustrated, if all a defendant had to was merge with another organization.\"\\n        Plaintiff\\'s Memorandum of November 22, 1974, Vol.  I, Appendix 232.\\n      \\n      \\n        10\\n         The following colloquy took place when the right to sue letters were offered in evidence:\\n        \"MR. MILTON: Yes, sir, Plaintiff\\'s Exhibit 49.  And I am adding two new exhibits which are not on my list, Exhibits 52 and 53.\\n        No. 52 is a Notice Of Right To Sue, a letter from the EEOC, as it relates to the International Union.\\n        THE COURT: Yes sir.\\n        MR.

HAMILTON: (Counsel for the Unions) No objection, Your Honor, with reservations as to materiality.\\n        THE COURT: Each is received.\\n        (Thereupon Plaintiff\\'s Exhibits 49, 52, and 53, for identification were received and filed in evidence.)\\n        THE COURT: Certainly Exhibits 52 and 53 are material or relevant.  The Right To Sue\\n        MR. HAMILTON: Your Honor, that may be.  We will have to see.\\n        THE COURT: Well all right.  I have allowed the amendment but we will see what the effect of it is.\"\\n        Vol.  II, Appendix, pages 415-416.\\n      \\n      \\n        11\\n         The International was named in a \"Right to Sue\" letter, while Local 570 was not\\n      \\n      \\n        12\\n         We note but reject as baseless the appellant\\'s earnest contention at oral argument that the appellees are bound by the grounds of decision relied upon by the district court.  A judgment may be defended on any ground consistent with the record, even though rejected by the trial court.  Here, where the trial court found against the appellant on the merits, we conclude that he should not have reached the merits but should have disposed of the claims in favor of the defendants on the issues of limitations and lack of jurisdiction.

We\\nAFFIRM.\\n                                             I.\\n       Williams worked as a waitress at Barnhill\u2019s Buffet, Inc. (\u201cBarnhill\u2019s\u201d) in\\nHattiesburg, Mississippi from June 2004, until January 2005. Williams alleges\\n\\n\\n       *\\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\\nR. 47.5.4.\\n\\x0c                                 No. 08-60136\\n\\nthat her immediate supervisor, Assistant Manager Randy Taylor, made\\nunwelcome sexual comments and advances during her tenure at Barnhill\u2019s. The\\nfirst incident took place in July 2004, when Williams and Taylor were in the\\nback storage room of the restaurant. In Williams\u2019s words, Taylor \u201cgrabbed me\\nby my apron, closed his eyes, and stuck his tongue down my mouth.\u201d Williams\\nstates that she fled the storage room in tears.\\n      A few weeks later, Taylor allegedly grabbed Williams and pulled her head\\ntoward his lap, saying \u201cI can tell by your lips that you do that well.\u201d Williams\\ntold two other servers about the incident, but did not report Taylor\u2019s conduct to\\nany manager or corporate representative of the company.\\n      In August 2004, Williams attended an orientation and sexual harassment\\nworkshop conducted by Barnhill\u2019s corporate representatives. The training\\nincluded an educational video about sexual harassment in the workplace. At the\\nclose of the session, Williams signed a form acknowledging that she had read the\\nanti-harassment policy and understood that sexual harassment was to be\\nreported to a manager or corporate representative.        Though she had the\\nopportunity to meet personally with corporate representatives that were on site\\nfor the training, Williams did not inform them of Taylor\u2019s previous harassment.\\n      By mid-August, Williams states that Taylor began to retaliate against her\\nfor rejecting his advances. Williams avers that Taylor would routinely assign\\nher to \u201cthe bad sections\u201d of the restaurant where she would earn less in tips.\\nShe also claims that she was the only waitress Taylor required to wash the wall\\nwhere servers dumped food.\\n      On January 20, 2005, Williams went into Taylor\u2019s office to pick up her\\ncheck. According to Williams, Taylor turned off the restaurant\u2019s security camera\\nand locked the door. He attempted to kiss her, tried to force his legs between\\nhers, and tried to unbutton her pants.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         2\\n\\x0c                                  No. 08-60136\\n\\n      After this incident, Williams \u201cdecided to get [] another job and just leave\\nit alone.\u201d She met with Barnhill\u2019s general manager, Von Nelson, and resigned.\\nWhen asked why she had decided to leave, Williams recounted Taylor\u2019s behavior.\\nBarnhill\u2019s immediately placed Taylor on suspension and questioned potential\\nwitnesses. Barnhill\u2019s also reviewed the footage from the restaurant\u2019s security\\ncamera, which corroborated Williams\u2019s story. On February 2, 2005, Barnhill\u2019s\\nterminated Taylor for misconduct involving the company\u2019s anti-harassment and\\nsecurity policies.\\n      In February 2005, Williams filed a charge of sex discrimination,\\nretaliation, and harassment with the EEOC. She subsequently filed suit under\\nTitle VII against Barnhill\u2019s and Randy Taylor. Taylor was dismissed from the\\nsuit on August 1, 2007.      The district court granted Barnhill\u2019s motion for\\nsummary judgment on January 8, 2008. Williams appeals.\\n                                       II.\\n      We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. LeMaire\\nv. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. and Dev., 480 F.3d 383, 386 (5th Cir. 2007). Summary\\njudgment is appropriate when, after considering the pleadings, discovery and\\ndisclosure on file, along with any affidavits, there is no genuine issue as to any\\nmaterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED. R.\\nCIV. P. 56(c). A genuine issue of material fact exists if the summary judgment\\nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\\nnon-movant. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505,\\n2510 (1986). All facts and evidence must be taken in the light most favorable to\\nthe non-movant. LeMaire, 480 F.3d at 387.\\n      In evaluating a claim of sexual harassment under Title VII, courts must\\nfirst determine whether the complaining employee has suffered a \u201ctangible\\nemployment action.\u201d See Casiano v. AT&T Corp., 213 F.3d 278, 283 (5th Cir.\\n2000). If she has, her suit is classified as a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d case; if she has not,\\n\\n                                        3\\n\\x0c                                  No. 08-60136\\n\\nher suit is classified as a \u201chostile environment\u201d case. Id. This distinction makes\\na difference. An employer that is held vicariously liable for \u201cquid pro quo\u201d\\nharassment is not permitted to advance the affirmative defense enunciated by\\nthe Supreme Court in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742,\\n118 S. Ct. 2257 (1998) and Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775,\\n118 S. Ct. 2275 (1998). Casiano, 213 F.3d at 283-84. In contrast, an employer\\nthat is found to have maintained a \u201chostile work environment\u201d may assert the\\nEllerth\/Faragher affirmative defense. Id. at 284.\\n      The district court determined that Williams had not suffered a \u201ctangible\\nemployment action,\u201d and thus could not advance a quid pro quo claim.\\nAnalyzing her claim as one of hostile work environment, the court determined\\nthat Barnhill\u2019s had satisfied the elements of the Ellerth\/Faragher affirmative\\ndefense and granted summary judgment on this basis.\\n                      A. Tangible Employment Action\\n      Williams first challenges the district court\u2019s finding that she did not suffer\\na \u201ctangible employment action.\u201d Williams asserts that Taylor\u2019s retaliation,\\nwhich consisted of assigning her to \u201cthe bad sections\u201d of the restaurant and\\nrequiring her to wash the wall where servers dumped food, amounted to a\\ntangible employment action. We disagree. The Supreme Court has defined a\\n\u201ctangible employment action\u201d as \u201ca significant change in employment status\\nsuch as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly\\ndifferent responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d\\nEllerth, 524 U.S. at 761, 118 S. Ct. at 2268. An employee does not suffer a\\ntangible employment action when a supervisor merely \u201cchange[s] her work\\nschedule and ask[s] her to perform tasks which she had not previously been\\nasked to perform.\u201d Watts v. Kroger Co., 170 F.3d 505, 510 (5th Cir. 1999).\\nBecause the job duties of a server at Barnhill\u2019s indisputably include some\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         4\\n\\x0c                                      No. 08-60136\\n\\njanitorial work, requiring Williams to wash the wall where servers dumped food\\nwas not a tangible employment action.\\n       Williams argues that her assignment to \u201cthe bad sections\u201d of the\\nrestaurant amounted to a tangible employment action because it reduced the\\namount she earned in tips. However, Williams has not directed this court to any\\nevidence that she earned less in tips because of Taylor\u2019s section assignments.\\nUnsupported, conclusory speculation is insufficient to create a genuine issue of\\nmaterial fact. See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994).\\n       Williams also contends that she suffered a tangible employment action\\nbecause she was constructively discharged.               In certain circumstances, a\\nconstructive discharge can be considered a tangible employment action. Aryain\\nv. Wal-Mart Stores Texas LP, ___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 2655792, at *4 (5th Cir.\\nJuly 8, 2008). However, even assuming that Williams properly raised her claim\\nof constructive discharge,1 she has nevertheless failed to submit evidence that\\nwould allow a reasonable jury to find that a constructive discharge occurred.\\n       To establish constructive discharge, an employee \u201cmust offer evidence that\\nthe employer made the employee\u2019s working conditions so intolerable that a\\nreasonable employee would feel compelled to resign. Brown v. Bunge Corp.,\\n207 F.3d 776, 782 (5th Cir. 2000) (quoting Barrow v. New Orleans Steamship\\nAss\u2019n, 10 F.3d 292, 297 (5th Cir . 1994)). The reasonableness of a plaintiff\u2019s\\ndecision is measured by an objective test. Hunt v. Rapides Healthcare Sys., LLC,\\n277 F.3d 757, 772 (5th Cir. 2002). Williams did not complain about Taylor\u2019s\\nbehavior until after she resigned, and she decided to resign before Barnhill\u2019s had\\nnotice of his misconduct. Barnhill\u2019s had no opportunity to correct her situation.\\n\\n\\n\\n       1\\n         Barnhill\u2019s argues that Williams has not administratively exhausted her constructive\\ndischarge claim and that she did not properly plead constructive discharge in her complaint.\\nWe do not address these arguments because it is apparent that Williams has not raised a\\nfactual issue as to whether she was constructively discharged.\\n\\n                                             5\\n\\x0c                                  No. 08-60136\\n\\nAn employee who resigns without affording the employer a reasonable\\nopportunity to address her concerns has not been constructively discharged. See\\nWoods v. Delta Beverage Group, Inc., 274 F.3d 295, 301 (5th Cir. 2001) (for\\npurposes of the constructive discharge analysis, a reasonable employee would\\nhave reported the sexual harassment before resigning); see also Boze v.\\nBranstetter, 912 F.2d 801, 805 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that, in most cases, a\\nreasonable employee would pursue internal remedies or file an EEOC complaint\\nbefore resigning).\\n      Because Williams did not suffer a tangible employment action or\\nconstructive discharge, the district court did not err in granting summary\\njudgment on Williams\u2019s quid pro quo claim.\\n                 B. Ellerth\/Faragher Affirmative Defense\\n      Williams argues that if her suit is properly analyzed as a hostile\\nenvironment claim, Barnhill\u2019s has failed to establish the elements of the\\nEllerth\/Faragher affirmative defense.       We assume arguendo that Taylor\u2019s\\nconduct created a hostile work environment. To establish this affirmative\\ndefense, Barnhill\u2019s must show by a preponderance of the evidence \u201c(a) that [it]\\nexercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually\\nharassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to\\ntake advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the\\nemployer or to avoid harm otherwise.\u201d Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S. Ct. at\\n2270; Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807, 118 S. Ct. at 2293.\\n      We agree with the district court that Barnhill\u2019s has satisfied both prongs\\nof the Ellerth\/Faragher defense as a matter of law. On the first prong, Barnhill\u2019s\\npresented ample evidence that it exercised reasonable care to prevent Taylor\u2019s\\nharassing behavior. The company regularly conducted training for its employees\\non the anti-harassment policy. Taylor stated in an affidavit that he received\\ntraining on Barnhill\u2019s anti-harassment policy as a part of his orientation to the\\n\\n                                        6\\n\\x0c                                  No. 08-60136\\n\\ncompany. Approximately one year after this initial orientation, Taylor again\\nreceived training regarding the anti-harassment policy and the handling of\\nsexual harassment complaints.\\n      Barnhill\u2019s also took prompt remedial action after Williams reported\\nTaylor\u2019s misconduct. Barnhill\u2019s immediately suspended Taylor and began an\\ninternal investigation. Barnhill\u2019s interviewed several witnesses and reviewed\\ntapes from the restaurant\u2019s security camera. Taylor was fired within days of\\nwhen Williams reported his assault. Further, Barnhill\u2019s management made it\\nclear to Williams that if she chose to stay, she would never be asked to work with\\nTaylor again and informed her that he had been terminated. Barnhill\u2019s actions\\nsatisfy the first prong of the defense. See Williams v. Admin. Rev. Bd., 376 F.3d\\n471, 479 (5th Cir. 2004); Cerros v. Steel Tech., Inc., 398 F.3d 944, 953 (7th Cir.\\n2005).\\n      Barnhill\u2019s also demonstrated that Williams unreasonably failed to take\\nadvantage of the preventive or corrective opportunities the company provided.\\nWithin two months of her hire, Williams took part in an anti-harassment\\ntraining session at the restaurant during which corporate representatives\\nexplained the anti-harassment policy in detail \u2014 including the proper procedure\\nfor employees to report harassment. Williams signed a form acknowledging that\\nshe had read the policy and understood the company\u2019s reporting requirements.\\nWilliams had the opportunity to meet personally with corporate representatives\\nof Barnhill\u2019s during the training, but she chose not to notify them of Taylor\u2019s\\nprevious harassment. Indeed, she did not inform any corporate representative\\nor manager about Taylor\u2019s conduct until the day she resigned.           Although\\nWilliams did confide in two fellow servers about her encounters with Taylor,\\nthese informal complaints to co-workers were insufficient to put Barnhill\u2019s on\\nnotice of the need to address Taylor\u2019s behavior. The district court did not err in\\nconcluding that Barnhill\u2019s has satisfied the Ellerth\/Faragher affirmative defense.\\n                                       III.\\n\\n\\n                                        7\\n\\x0c                         No. 08-60136\\n\\nFor these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               8\\n\\x0c', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 63552}]"},{"id":74985,"date_filed":"2000-12-28","judges":"Birch, Tjoflat, Vining","case_name_full":"Sandy SKURSTENIS, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.

The first search, for weapons and\\n\\ncontraband, occurred when the detainee was booked into the jail and was conducted by a female deputy; the\\nsecond search, for lice, took place the following morning and was conducted by a male nurses assistant. The\\ndistrict court held that both searches were unconstitutional but that the sheriff and deputy sheriff were entitled\\n\\nto qualified immunity with respect to the initial search; the district court further held that neither the sheriff\\nnor the nurses assistant was entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the second search. Concluding that\\nboth searches were constitutional, we affirm in part, albeit on different grounds, and reverse in part.\\n\\n                                              I. BACKGROUND\\n\\n        On the evening of May 8, 1998, a Shelby County, Alabama, deputy sheriff arrested Sandy Skurstenis\\nfor driving under the influence of alcohol. Her blood alcohol registered .18 on the deputy\\'s portable\\n\\nBreathalyzer and registered .15 on an intoxilyzer test administered shortly thereafter. At the time of her\\narrest, Skurstenis had a .38 special handgun, for which she had an expired permit, in the floorboard of her car.\\n\\n        After her arrest, Skurstenis was taken to the Shelby County Jail, where, because of her blood alcohol\\n\\n\\n    *\\n     Honorable Robert L. Vining, Jr., U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, sitting by\\ndesignation.\\n\\x0clevel, she was to remain until around 11:00 a.m. the following morning.1 After being booked into the jail,\\n\\nSkurstenis was taken to a restroom adjacent to the booking area by Deputy Stacy Blankenship, a female\\nofficer. Skurstenis was told to disrobe, to turn and face the wall, and to squat and cough. After doing this,\\n\\nshe was given a jail uniform, was escorted by Deputy Jason Smitherman through an area where other female\\n\\ninmates were sleeping, and was placed in a solitary cell.\\n\\n        The next morning, at approximately 10:30 a.m., Skurstenis was instructed to go to the infirmary,\\nwhere she encountered three other female inmates and one male, T.O. Richey, a nurses assistant,2 employed\\nby the Shelby Baptist Medical Center. Richey worked part-time at the jail pursuant to a contract between the\\nsheriff\\'s office and the medical center. When he was finished with the other inmates, Richey asked them to\\n\\nleave and then informed Skurstenis that pursuant to the jail\\'s policy, he was required to run certain tests on\\n\\nher. After Skurstenis signed a consent form, Richey took some blood samples from her and then told her to\\npull her pants down so that he could check for lice. Richey ran his fingers through the hair on her head and\\nalso through her pubic hair. At no time did he touch her genitalia. When the examination was completed,\\n\\nSkurstenis left the infirmary and a short time thereafter was discharged from the jail and left with her\\nhusband, who had come to get her.\\n        Skurstenis subsequently filed this action against Sheriff James Jones, Chief Jailer Captain Wayne\\n\\nWatts, Deputies Jason Smitherman and Stacy Blankenship, and T.O. Richey in their individual capacities,\\nand asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for constitutional violations3 and under state law for invasion of\\nprivacy, assault, and battery.4\\n        In ruling on the defendants\\' motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary\\n\\n\\n    1\\n      Individuals arrested for driving under the influence cannot be released on bond but must be detained\\nin jail for a number of hours, depending on the degree of intoxication. Alabama Code \u00a7 31-5A-191\\n(1975).\\n    2\\n     His official title is \"multi functional technician.\"\\n    3\\n     In her complaint Skurstenis alleged that her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated.\\nSince she did not contend that any procedural due process rights were violated, the district court correctly\\nanalyzed her claims as being under only the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has held that, where\\nan enumerated constitutional right specifically applies to a claimed violation, the claim should be\\nanalyzed only as a possible violation of that enumerated right, not under the generalized notion of\\nsubstantive due process. Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989).\\n    4\\n    Skurstenis also sued Shelby County and Shelby Baptist Medical Center. The district court, however,\\ndismissed Skurstenis\\'s claims against those entities, and those dismissals are not challenged in this appeal.\\n\\x0cjudgment to Captain Watts and Deputy Smitherman on the basis that they had no real connection to the strip\\n\\nsearch that occurred when Skurstenis was booked into the jail and that her complaint, therefore, failed to state\\n\\na claim against them. The district court further held that the initial strip search violated the Skurstenis\\'s\\nconstitutional rights but that Sheriff Jones and Deputy Blankenship were entitled to qualified immunity.\\n\\nFinally, the district court held that the infirmary search violated Skurstenis\\'s constitutional rights, that Sheriff\\n\\nJones was not entitled to qualified immunity, that Richey had no standing to assert qualified immunity, and\\nthat, even if he did, he would not be entitled to qualified immunity.5 Recognizing that only the denials of\\n\\nqualified immunity would be appealable as a matter of right, the district court certified its order pursuant to\\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), and this court granted permission for Skurstenis to appeal those portions of the district\\n\\ncourt\\'s order which granted qualified immunity.\\n\\n                                                II. DISCUSSION\\n\\n         A district court\\'s grant or denial of summary judgment is subject to de novo review by this court.\\n\\nHamilton v. Allen-Bradley Co., 217 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir.2000).\\n\\n        In Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court held that\\n\\nroutine strip searching of pretrial detainees was not a per se violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition\\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures. In articulating the balancing test applicable to such searches, the\\n\\nCourt stated:\\n        The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\\n        mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\\n        against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the\\n        particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\\n        place in which it occurred.\\n\\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\\n\\n         The Bell balancing test for reasonableness requires, at a minimum, that the facts upon which the\\n\\nintrusion is based be capable of measurement against an objective standard. Although one appellate court\\n\\ninitially suggested that probable cause might be required to justify a strip search, Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d\\n\\n160 (7th Cir.1980) (\"The searches were conducted despite the absence of probable cause to believe that the\\n\\ndetainees were concealing contraband or weapons on their bodies.\"), the courts of appeal now recognize that\\n\\n\\n    5\\n      The district court also granted summary judgment to Captain Watts with respect to the infirmary\\nsearch, since the claim against him was based on the fact that he was the chief jailer. The district court\\ncorrectly noted that under Alabama Code \u00a7 14-6-1, the sheriff, not the jailer, is the person given legal\\nresponsibility for the legal custody of inmates and that, consequently, the sheriff, not the chief jailer, is\\nthe final decision maker about jail policy.\\n\\x0c\"reasonable suspicion\" may justify a strip search of a pretrial detainee. See, e.g., Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d\\n\\n1 (1st Cir.1997); Warner v. Grand County, 57 F.3d 962 (10th Cir.1995); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d\\n\\nCir.1986) Stewart v. Lubbock County, Texas, 767 F.2d 153 (5th Cir.1985); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago,\\n\\n723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983). Indeed, in upholding the strip search of a juvenile, this court specifically held\\n\\nthat law enforcement officers \"may conduct a strip search of a juvenile in custody, even for a minor offense,\\n\\nbased upon reasonable suspicion to believe that the juvenile is concealing weapons or contraband.\" Justice\\n\\nv. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11th Cir.1992).\\n\\n            It is undisputed that Policy Number B-103 of the Shelby County Jail requires that each inmate be\\n\\nstrip searched by a same sex jail staff member before being placed in a cell or detention room. This policy,\\nwhich does not require any reasonable suspicion, does not comport with the requirements of the Fourth\\n\\nAmendment. This court thus joins every other circuit which has had occasion to review a similar policy and\\n\\nholds such policy to be unconstitutional. See Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393 (10th Cir.1993) (citing cases\\n\\nfrom other circuits holding same).\\n            Because of one significant factor, however, this holding does not mean that the initial strip search\\n\\nperformed on Skurstenis was ipso facto unconstitutional. When she was arrested and taken into custody,\\n\\nSkurstenis had a .38 special handgun in her possession. Recognizing, as did the Bell court, that a detention\\n\\ncenter is a place \"fraught with serious security dangers,\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884, and, because\\n\\nof the deference that should be afforded in matters of institutional security, see, e.g., Hughes v. Rowe, 449\\n\\nU.S. 5, 101 S.Ct. 173, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980), this court holds that possession of a weapon by a detainee\\nprovides the \"reasonable suspicion\" necessary to authorize a strip search.\\n\\n            Having concluded that the search was justified, the court must now consider the other Bell factors,\\n\\nviz., the manner in which the search was conducted and the place in which it was conducted. Skurstenis was\\n\\ntaken to a bathroom and was observed only by Deputy Blankenship, a female officer; no body cavity search\\nwas undertaken. Under similar facts, this court concluded, \"Without a doubt, the officers conducted the strip\\n\\nsearch in the least intrusive manner.\" Justice, 961 F.2d at 193. Consequently, this court concludes that\\n\\nSkurstenis\\'s constitutional rights were not violated by the strip search performed when she was booked into\\n\\nthe jail.\\n\\n            The court now turns to the strip search performed on Skurstenis by T.O. Richey, the morning after\\nshe was incarcerated. A sheriff in Alabama \"has the legal custody and charge of the jail in his county and\\n\\x0call prisoners committed thereto.\" Alabama Code \u00a7 14-6-1 (1975). Thus, for purposes of Monell v.\\n\\nDepartment of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), the sheriff is the final\\n\\ndecision maker with respect to jail policy.\\n\\n         The Alabama legislature has mandated that sheriffs \"exercise every precaution to prevent the spread\\nof disease among the inmates.\" Alabama Code \u00a7 14-6-95. Pursuant to this mandate, the Shelby County jail\\n\\ninstituted a policy of searching all inmates who have been admitted to the general jail population for\\n\\ncommunicable diseases at the earliest possible time during their incarceration. Because of the prevalence of\\nhead and body lice among inmates and because of the difficulty in sanitizing an area after lice have been\\n\\nfound, one of the prime objectives of this search is to determine if an inmate has such lice.\\n\\n        The Shelby County Commission contracted with the Shelby Baptist Medical Center [\"SBMC\"] to\\n\\nprovide medical services within the Shelby County jail. Under this contract, SBMC provided a nurses\\nassistant and a registered nurse to the jail; those individuals generally worked Monday through Friday from\\n\\n7:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. In exchange for these services, Shelby County reimbursed SBMC on an expense\\n\\nreimbursement basis, consisting of the salaries of the nurses assistant and registered nurse, supplies purchased\\nby SBMC, and any services provided directly by SBMC. SBMC is a not-for-profit corporation, and the\\n\\ncontract between SBMC and Shelby County was performed on a not-for-profit basis.\\n\\n        Although Sheriff Jones has adopted a policy requiring inmates to undergo a body search for\\ncommunicable diseases at the earliest possible time, he has not promulgated any regulations with respect to\\n\\nhow this search is to be performed. Instead, the manner in which this kind of search is to be conducted is\\n\\ncontrolled by procedures promulgated by SBMC and conveyed by SBMC to its employees. Under these\\nprocedures, when there is a body search for lice, cranial and pubic hair both are examined, but there is no\\n\\nunnecessary contact with the inmate, nor are the inmate\\'s genitals touched.\\n\\n        As with the booking search, this court applies the Bell balancing factors of scope, manner,\\n\\njustification and place with respect to this communicable disease search.6 Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at\\n\\n1884. The search took place in the infirmary, with no one present except Skurstenis and the nurses assistant.\\n\\n\\n\\n    6\\n     Both Skurstenis and the district court emphasized that this search was conducted a short time before\\nSkurstenis was released from the jail, intimating that the search was some kind of \"exit\" search.\\nHowever, the search was conducted at the first opportunity by medical personnel and was conducted the\\nmorning that Skurstenis was released only because the medical personnel did not arrive until that time.\\nThe fact that the search preceded Skurstenis\\'s release from custody by just a few minutes was merely\\ncoincidental.\\n\\x0cThe intrusion was minimal, and, because of the threat of the transmission of body lice among inmates, the\\n\\nsearch was certainly justified. This leaves only the consideration of the manner in which the search was\\nconducted. It was this factor which was of the greatest concern to the district court, and it found the search\\n\\nhighly offensive because it was conducted by a male upon a female. The district court failed to give proper\\n\\nweight, however, to the fact that the male was part of the medical staff of a hospital and was a nurses\\n\\nassistant.\\n         Although courts seem virtually unanimous in condemning strip searches conducted by prison\\n\\npersonnel of the opposite sex except in the most extreme of circumstances, they are not so outspoken when\\nit comes to strip searches by medical personnel. Indeed, on those rare occasions when courts have discussed\\n\\nstrip searches by medical personnel, it is to point out that body cavity searches should be performed by\\n\\nmedical, not jail, personnel. The sex of the medical person conducting the search is either not identified or\\n\\nis mentioned only for informational purposes. See, e.g., Torres v. Wisconsin Department of Health and Social\\n\\nServices, 859 F.2d 1523 (7th Cir.1988) (en banc) (recognizing, in a Title VII suit brought by male officers\\n\\nchallenging a decision to permit only female officers in the living units of an all-female prison, that the\\nWisconsin Administrative Code requires strip searches to be performed \"in private by an officer of the same\\n\\nsex\" and that \"[b]ody cavity searches are only performed by medical personnel in emergencies\"); Bonitz v.\\n\\nFair, 804 F.2d 164 (1st Cir.1986) (finding body cavity searches by prison officers unconstitutional and noting\\n\\nthat the officers conducting the searches \"did not follow prison instructions that required internal examination\\n\\nof body cavities to be conducted by medical personnel\"), overruled on other grounds, Unwin v. Campbell,\\n\\n863 F.2d 124 (1st Cir.1988); Daughtery v. Harris, 476 F.2d 292 (10th Cir.1973) (upholding rectal searches\\n\\n\"carried out by trained paraprofessional medical assistants\"); Tribble v. Gardner, 860 F.2d 321 (9th Cir.1988)\\n\\n(holding that prison officials were not entitled to qualified immunity when digital rectal searches were not\\nreasonably related to legitimate penological concerns and were conducted for punitive purposes but also\\n\\nnoting that the searches were conducted by a \"physician\\'s assistant\"); Hurley v. Ward, 584 F.2d 609 (2d\\n\\nCir.1978) (holding visual searches of the anal and genital areas of prisoners without probable cause to be\\nunconstitutional but quoting New York law as follows: \"If there is reasonable cause to believe contraband\\n\\nhas been concealed in a body cavity, the inmate shall be immediately examined and\/or x-rayed by a facility\\n\\nhealth staff member\").\\n         Holding that it is not inappropriate for medical personnel to conduct a strip search of an inmate of\\n\\x0cthe opposite sex and determining that the examination of Skurstenis for body lice was otherwise reasonable,\\n\\nthis court concludes that Sheriff Jones and Richey did not violate Skurstenis\\'s constitutional rights.\\nConsequently, the district court\\'s orders denying them summary judgment are reversed.\\n\\n                                              III.

Madigan, III, New York City, for respondent.\\n\\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\\nBRIEANT, District Judge.\\nFamiliarity with all prior proceedings in this matter on the part of the reader is assumed.\\nPursuant to Section 7 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, et seq., and \u00a7 9 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 49, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") sought an order from this Court directing Pan American World Airways, Inc. (\"Pan Am\") to comply with the terms of a subpoena duces tecum issued on January 14, 1983. The EEOC had initiated an investigation in response to about 13 separate employee complaints of age based discrimination with respect to the supervisory work force practices of Pan Am at its John F. Kennedy International Airport facility (\"JFK\"). Specifically, the complaints charged that since January 1980 Pan Am had engaged in a systematic practice of age based discrimination in executing its \"Reduction in Force\" (\"RIF\") program, whereby older, more experienced supervisors have been terminated or intimidated into retirement while younger, less experienced and lower paid supervisory personnel have been retained and promoted.\\nPan Am resisted the subpoena, contending that it imposed an excessive burden on a struggling business seeking to cope with a changed business climate and rehabilitate itself, and also on the ground that much of the information sought was irrelevant and the scope was excessively broad and unrelated to the level of corporate discretion under investigation. In addition, Pan Am asserted to this Court that the statistical information sought by Part II of the subpoena was not a valid sample of the supervisory work force under investigation, and therefore a \"useless fishing expedition.\" Pan Am also contended that the subpoena should be limited because its scope was inconsistent with the published \"ADEA Case Processing Procedures\" of the EEOC, and argued in a moving fashion to this Court that the tremendous bulk of data demanded by this subpoena, and the manpower necessary to accumulate this information would pose an unreasonable and excessive burden on its already precarious financial state.\\nThis Court by a Memorandum and Order dated March 23, 1983 reached the following conclusion:\\n\"In subpoena enforcement proceedings, absent a showing that the investigating agency is without authority, or the information sought irrelevant, or that the demand *1532 itself is too indefinite, or compliance too burdensome, the court will not restrict the investigatory power granted the EEOC by Congress. United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 652 [70 S. Ct. 357, 368, 94 L. Ed. 401] (1950); Federal Trade Commission v. Rockefeller, 591 F.2d 182 (2d Cir.1979); See Rule 45(b), F.R.Civ.P. and Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-8. Those concerned with the burdensome effect of such demands on commerce should address themselves to Congress for relief.\\nFor the purposes of this motion, it is conceded that the EEOC is acting within its statutory authority and that the information demanded by Part 2 of the subpoena is sufficiently definite.\"\\nThis Court concluded that the information sought was relevant and that the EEOC was acting within its investigatory powers to examine it. This Court also held that while the subpoena was burdensome, the Court was unable to find that compliance would \"unduly disrupt or seriously hinder normal operation\" of Pan Am, thereby imposing an excessive burden upon it. The Court directed Pan Am to permit the EEOC to make an on site examination of all relevant records, and held that following such discovery in place, production of any additional information necessary to comply with the provisions of Part II of the subpoena should be compelled only upon further formal application to the Court.\\nThis determination was apparently unsatisfactory to both parties. However, no appeal was taken, and the process of compliance therewith commenced.\\nSome two months later and on June 23, 1983, the Supreme Court decided the case of Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S. Ct. 2764, 77 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1983). In Chadha, the Court held that the one-house legislative veto of an exercise by the Executive Branch of authority delegated by Congress (to the Attorney General) was unconstitutional and that such a provision was severable from the initial delegation, and void.\\nPossibly the Court in Chadha was unaware of the far reaching possibilities of its sudden discovery that the time honored process of legislative veto, authorized since 1932 in 295 separate Congressional procedures in 196 different statutes, was unconstitutional.[1] Perhaps it did not foresee the consequent disruption to ongoing litigation. In any event, the Court made no attempt to deal with the issue of whether its newly declared rule was retrospective, and the related issue of whether all such delegations remained valid, with only the reserved veto power stricken as void.[2]\\nIt was only a matter of time before litigants situated as is Pan Am would discern that the one house veto provision of the Reorganization Act of 1977 was also unconstitutional. The delegation of power from Congress to the President therein contained in turn permitted the President in 1978 to reorganize the Executive Branch of Government so as to transfer enforcement authority for the ADEA and the Equal Pay Act to the EEOC from the Department of Labor, which he did.\\nChadha was followed shortly by a motion to dismiss a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, EEOC v. Allstate Insurance Co., 570 F. Supp. 1224 (S.D.Miss., 1983). This action involved a suit under the Equal Pay Act, enforcement of which was transferred from the Department of Labor to the EEOC by the same Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978 which also transferred the ADEA enforcement function to the EEOC. Judge Barbour dismissed that action by summary judgment for lack of *1533 capacity to sue, holding that the Reorganization Act of 1977 was unconstitutional. His opinion finds standing on the part of the defendant employer to raise the issue, concludes that the provisions here considered are not severable, and that Chadha must be applied retroactively.\\nThe Court in Allstate also held (at 1228):\\n\"Does the fact that no veto was interposed alter the requirements of bicameralism and presentment?\\nThe question presented by this case is not directly answered in Chadha. Chadha did emphasize the importance of preserving the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of government [footnote omitted]. Moreover, the Court noted that `[t]o allow Congress to evade the strictures of the Constitution and in effect enact Executive proposals into law by mere silence cannot be squared with Art. I.\\' Chadha, [___] U.S. at [___] n. 22, 103 S. Ct. at 2787 n. 22. It is evident from the opinion in Chadha that `every use of the legislative veto\\' is invalid [footnote omitted].\\nThe fundamental problem with the legislative retention of veto power is that it places the executive in the position of legislating subject to a Congressional veto [footnote omitted]. In this sense it stands Art. I of the Constitution on its head. Congress had various tools by which it may control its grant of power, but `Congress must abide by its delegation of authority until that delegation is legislatively altered or revoked.\\' Id. 103 S.Ct. at 2786. Because the Court in Chadha clearly sweeps with a broad stroke in its holding that the legislative one-house veto is unconstitutional, this Court must follow that precedent [footnote omitted] by holding that a retained one-house veto is unconstitutional even when not exercised.\"\\nThe Allstate decision evoked a motion from Pan Am, heard by this Court on October 26, 1983, to vacate its prior decision enforcing the subpoena. This Court\\'s view of the significance of the issue thus raised and Pan Am\\'s position in the matter could be discerned from colloquy between counsel for Pan Am and the Court as follows:\\n\"THE COURT: So it\\'s your contention that the Department of Labor could enforce the Act in this case but that the EEOC couldn\\'t?\\nMR. MADIGAN [Attorney for Pan Am]: That\\'s correct.\\nTHE COURT: Are you just quarreling about which bureaucrat is to pursue you? And supposing it were the conclusion of this court that you were right, wouldn\\'t everything have to be held in abeyance until the bureaucrats could change? You get a different face with the same issues.\\nMR. MADIGAN: That may well be.\\n* * * * * *\\nTHE COURT: It\\'s kind of a bootless motion isn\\'t it? If you are right it wouldn\\'t necessarily lead to vacating any of the orders. It would just simply change the identity of the persons who can pursue your client.\\nMR. MADIGAN: I think that presumes that an identical approach would be taken by a different agency, and I don\\'t think that that is a fair presumption when we are merely at the stage of investigating some charges that have been filed.\\nI don\\'t think it can fairly be stated that we would be before you right now with the Department of Labor instead of the EEOC if what we are describing had not transpired.\\nTHE COURT: I\\'d like to understand why it would make any difference.\\nMR. MADIGAN: Because we wouldn\\'t be subjected to this investigation and the expenses associated with it.\\nTHE COURT: Are you suggesting that the Department of Labor doesn\\'t conduct wasteful investigations?\\nMR. MADIGAN: I don\\'t know whether the Department of Labor would or would not, and that is precisely the problem. I think that is merely a speculative notion. I don\\'t think that the EEOC can stand before you and say that the Department of Labor would be proceeding in precisely *1534 the same fashion. They haven\\'t submitted at least anything that I have seen to indicate that such is the case other than to take the position. They haven\\'t sought to include the Department of Labor.\\n* * * * * *\\nTHE COURT: You want to get into a Never-never-land where the court says that it belongs to the Department of Labor and the Department of Labor says, `Oh, no, it should have stayed with the EEOC.\\'\\nMR. MADIGAN: I think it\\'s the EEOC who hopes to have the Never-never-land result achieved. They are the ones who say ignore the unconstitutionality of the Reorganization Act, that no past, present, or future litigant can raise it because they say even if you were to find an agreement with our position, that it makes the entire act unconstitutional and that they have no authority, nevertheless, you should decide that it doesn\\'t apply to this case or any other, and therefore it goes off into space some-where.\\n* * * * * *\\nMR. MADIGAN: ... It\\'s mere speculation to say the same result would obtain if it was a different agency.\\nTHE COURT: All right, but your position is that if the other agency [Department of Labor] signs the subpoena, that you will comply with it?\\nMR. MADIGAN: That only one agency has the authority, and that we will recognize the one that we feel has the authority, and that is the Department of Labor.\"\\nThe Court attempted to resolve the problem presented by Chadha, followed by Allstate, in a manner considered both fair and pragmatic. By its oral order and decision of October 26, 1983, this Court held:\\n\"THE COURT: The court disposes of this application in the following fashion:\\nThe court finds that the pendency of an appeal in the Fifth Circuit and a direct appeal to the Supreme Court in the Allstate case makes it inexpedient for this court at this time to grant the relief requested herein to the extent that it would require this court to consider de novo a complex and difficult constitutional issue.\\nThe court recognizes that any delay in this proceeding, if it is a meritorious proceeding, could redound to the detriment of public policy and also perhaps to the detriment of individual employees of Pan American or former employees of Pan American.\\nThe Court believes that a rational disposition of this motion is as follows, and the court now makes the following directions:\\nCompliance with the subpoena duces tecum issued by the petitioner, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, dated March 23, 1983, is from henceforward stayed in all respects unless and until that subpoena or a document substantially identical as to form shall be issued to Pan American World Airways bearing the signature of the Secretary of Labor or his duly authorized deputy for the purpose of issuing enforcement subpoenas in those statutory matters as to which the Secretary of Labor has jurisdiction to investigate and enforce compliance with such statutes.\\nThe court does not in any way attempt to prejudge the issue of whether the Secretary of Labor will issue such a subpoena or will not do so. The court does not at this point consider whether the Secretary of Labor can associate [with] himself in the investigation the staff members of Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, but I think it\\'s quite obvious that if he wishes to, he may, and absent a court order staying any such subpoena when issued, it should be complied with; and the court does not have to decide what might happen tomorrow but I am giving you an indication.\\nThe court declines to dismiss the EEOC\\'s underlying petition herein or directing the EEOC to return to Pan Am the documents it has previously obtained because the court believes that one branch or another of the federal government will have and does have the continuing right to demand compliance with *1535 the statutes and to investigate alleged cases of noncompliance, and that if in the final analysis it be adjudged that the decision in EEOC against Allstate is affirmed, that the government could be expected to retransfer these activities to the Department of Labor, [or] attempt to repass the Reorganization Act without violating the principles of the Chadha case, so that in this court\\'s view, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can continue to hold those documents and can continue to consider them for the benefit of whatever branch of the federal government shall ultimately obtain the lawful right to administer the act and enforce compliance with the act, and that in the interim it\\'s not contested that the Secretary of Labor has the right to investigate and subpoena documents, and compel compliance, and if he does so, that should be permitted, and pending such time as he shall resolve to pursue the production and inspection of additional documents, compliance with the subpoena henceforward should be and it hereby is stayed.\"\\nThereafter, by a motion heard December 20, 1983, the EEOC sought relief from this Court\\'s oral order of October 26, 1983, essentially upon its conclusion that Allstate was wrongly decided. It appeared at the oral argument of that motion that no attempt had been made by the EEOC to have the Department of Labor join in the subpoena in the case of Pan Am, and thereby remove any question as to the legitimacy of this investigation. Instead, the EEOC concentrated its attack on the conclusion reached in the Allstate case and supported here by Pan Am. Apparently the reasons, if any there be, for failing to do so relate to turf consciousness among bureaucrats within different departments of the same branch of Government, with which this Court has little patience.\\nWe concede at the outset of our discussion that the decision in Allstate is not binding precedent upon this Court. Indeed it would not be binding were its author appointed for this district. See Farley v. Farley, 481 F.2d 1009, 1012 (3rd Cir. 1973), which holds:\\n\"[E]ven if [prior E.D.Pa. district court decision] had decided the precise issue, its holding is not a precedent binding on other courts. The decision of a three-judge court is entitled to no more weight than any other district court decision. See 1B J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 0.402[1] n. 29 at 62. Consequently, the [prior district court decision] is not necessarily binding on any other district court, id. at 61, and does not invariably have to be followed in the Eastern District. Id. at 58-59.\"\\nSee also, United States v. Birney, 686 F.2d 102, 107 (2d Cir.1982) (law of the case); Aknin v. Phillips, 424 F. Supp. 104, 105 (S.D.N.Y.1976) (this court may disregard conflicting decision of the Third Circuit).\\nHowever, this does not suggest that the decision in Allstate, which gives thoughtful consideration to all aspects of this problem presently before us, should be disregarded. This is particularly true when there is no clear signal from the Supreme Court to assist the inferior courts in dealing with a host of foreseeable post-Chadha problems. Whether Judge Barbour is right or wrong in his analysis will depend entirely on the analysis of higher courts. No jurisprudential purpose will be served, and scarce judicial resources on all levels will be wasted if we, and every other district judge who happens to have an Equal Pay Act or ADEA lawsuit on his or her docket should immediately woo the Muse and set down a lengthy opinion having the same 50-50 chance of being right as the Allstate opinion has.\\nHowever, as Jimmy Durante used to say, \"everybody wants to get inta de Act,\" and it was only a matter of time before another equal and coordinate district court found it desirable to add to the learning on the point. Familiarity with Muller Optical Co. v. EEOC, 574 F. Supp. 946, not yet reported (W.D.Tenn., November 10, 1983), is assumed. In Muller Optical, Judge Odell Horton reviewed the same issues dealt with in Allstate, supra, and expressed his dissatisfaction, as he had the right to do, with that decision, holding, correctly, that *1536 \"[t]hat decision, of course, is not binding on this Court,\" (fn. 1 at p. 950) and describing his Court as \"sailing in (sic) largely uncharted seas.\" (Id.)\\nThe Court in Muller Optical went on to distinguish Chadha because with respect to the Reorganization Act the one-house veto had not been exercised. Indulging in what it characterized as an \"unavoidable attempt at clairvoyance,\" the court considered the issue of severability, reaching a different conclusion than Allstate, for reasons expressed therein which this Court finds no more and no less rational and persuasive than the reasoning relied on in Allstate to support a contrary result.\\nThe order denying an injunction, in Muller Optical, like the judgment of dismissal in Allstate, was appealable, and indeed an appeal to the Sixth Circuit was docketed on November 29, 1983. Indeed, as to Allstate, we have been informed by counsel that the Supreme Court has already noted probable jurisdiction for direct appeal, and a separate appeal has been docketed in the Fifth Circuit on October 19, 1983.\\nFlush with victory after Muller Optical, the EEOC presented the instant motion to be relieved from this Court\\'s order of October 26, 1983.\\nThat motion, heard December 20, 1983, is denied. This Court perceives no significant change in circumstances merely because of the subsequent issuance of the Muller Optical opinion. We think our temporary resolution of the issue as of October 26, 1983 was then and remains now reasonable, practical and fair. No legitimate excuse is proffered for failing to proceed thereunder. Although the Secretary of Labor has never been asked to authorize the subpoena, this Court regards as highly speculative Pan Am\\'s suggestion, or hope, that he would not do so if asked, because of the claimed burdensome and meritless character of the underlying grievance.\\nThe appeal as of right which could have been taken from our October 26, 1983 order was not taken. There is no significant change in the relevant facts, merely by the issuance of the Muller Optical opinion.\\nWere respondent genuinely concerned with this particular investigation, it could have obtained ratification and participation from the Secretary of Labor, more than two months ago. Alternatively, it may seek legislative relief from the Congress, either limited to this enforcement function, or extending to a general amnesty or ratification of all that has been done since 1932 in reliance on the presumed constitutionality (or more likely, the presumed non-justiciability) of the one-house veto. Indeed it could move for reconsideration by the Supreme Court of the Chadha case itself, so as to obtain a stay similar to that granted in Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1982), or a declaration of non-retroactivity. Or, it can litigate Allstate and\/or Muller Optical to their ultimate unpredictable denouement.\\nApparently, as our hearing of December 20, 1983 made clear, the EEOC will do none of these. Rather, it has developed an apparent strategy to wage total litigation on eleven or twelve different fronts wherever and whenever it can, requiring district courts in every circuit to relitigate the issue of Allstate\\x97Muller Optical so that each Circuit may rule separately thereon, with ultimate recourse to the Supreme Court to resolve the foreseeable conflict in the Circuits. This appears to me to be unnecessary, unfair to the employers and employees alike, and wasteful as well as expensive. We should not allow our scarce judicial resources to be squandered in such a profligate fashion.\\nMotion denied.\\nSo Ordered.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Justice Powell concurring noted that \"the breadth of this holding gives one pause.\"\\n[2]  This Court believes that a respectable argument can be made that Chadha should not be applied retrospectively. Some prudential considerations must affect such sudden far sweeping constitutional pronouncements by the Court. We note that neither the notorious Miranda rule nor Mapp were applied retrospectively. To have done so would have produced utter chaos. Chadha invites chaos. The Supreme Court could have considered this problem, but it did not. Cf. Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v.

Mills, Superintendent of Schools, charging that they discriminated against her because of her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.1   Wardwell\\'s complaint alleged that the School Board and Mills wrongfully denied her a promotion to the position of Acting Director of Transportation for the school system and that they constructively discharged her from her position as Assistant Director of Transportation.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      A bench trial was held in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  The trial judge found that (1) Wardwell had \"established a prolonged, persistent and pervasive pattern of discrimination against women in the thirty-two administrative high-level, non-instructional positions of Assistant Director or higher in Defendant\\'s hierarchy,\" (2) that the School Board and Mills intentionally discriminated against Wardwell in selecting a man for the position of Acting Director of Transportation, and (3) that appellants\\' treatment of Wardwell and her subsequent resignation amounted to a constructive discharge.  Record on Appeal, vol. 1 at 20-29.  The district court ordered that Wardwell be immediately returned to her position as Assistant Director of Transportation and awarded her back pay, costs, and attorney\\'s fees.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      The School Board and Mills now appeal this decision, claiming that the district court\\'s findings of a pattern of discrimination, intentional discrimination, and constructive discharge are all clearly erroneous.  We conclude that the pattern of discrimination finding and the constructive discharge finding are clearly erroneous.  We vacate the intentional discrimination finding and remand.\\n    \\n    I. DISCUSSION\\n    A. Pattern of Discrimination\\n    \\n      4\\n      The School Board and Mills claim that the district court\\'s finding that a pattern of discrimination against women existed in the Palm Beach County school system is clearly erroneous.  We need not decide whether the evidence is sufficient to support this finding.  Wardwell has conceded on appeal that the evidence did not support such a finding.\\n    \\n    B. Intentional Discrimination\\n    \\n      5\\n      The district court found that Wardwell had satisfied her burden of making out a prima facie case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 95 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).  The School Board does not challenge that finding on appeal.  Thus, the burden shifted to the School Board \"to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\" for its actions.    Id. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824.  The School Board advanced three reasons for the failure to promote Wardwell to the position of Acting Director.  These reasons were:  (1) that Superintendent Mills followed a policy of not appointing anyone to an acting position if that person might be a candidate for the permanent position;  (2) that the investigation of wrongdoing in the Transportation Department was still continuing at the time Goode was appointed;  and (3) that Superintendent Mills did not want to appoint anyone within the Transportation Department as Acting Director because of the way such a choice might be perceived by other employees and the public in light of the intense publicity concerning the investigation.  The district court found that the Board\\'s reasons were pretextual and that the Board intentionally discriminated against Wardwell in failing to appoint her Acting Director.  The issue on appeal relates to the district court\\'s analysis of these three reasons and its finding that they were pretextual.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      We decline the School Board\\'s invitation to reverse this finding as clearly erroneous.  However, several factors persuade us that the district court\\'s finding of intentional discrimination must be vacated and the case remanded.  First, we are not satisfied that the trial judge\\'s erroneous finding of a pattern of discrimination did not influence his conclusion that the School Board intentionally discriminated against Wardwell.  Thus, a remand is necessary for a redetermination of the intentional discrimination issue in light of this court\\'s finding that the pattern of discrimination finding is clearly erroneous.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      The second factor prompting our remand decision relates to the district court\\'s handling of the School Board\\'s argument that they declined to appoint Wardwell as Acting Director because of the public\\'s perception of such a choice.  The district court rejected this reason in conclusory fashion as \"lack[ing] any support in fact or logic.\"    Record on Appeal, vol. 1 at 28.  However, the record contains an ample factual basis to support this reason.  Furthermore, it comports with logic and common sense that the general public might frown upon appointing the Assistant Director when the Director himself has just been relieved of duty under a widely publicized cloud of suspicion.  We conclude that the district court was clearly erroneous in rejecting this reason as lacking in any support in fact or logic.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Third, we vacate and remand the intentional discrimination finding because the district court\\'s primary reason for rejecting another of the School Board\\'s proffered explanations is clearly erroneous.  The School Board asserted that one reason Wardwell was not promoted to Acting Director was that the investigation of the Transportation Department was still continuing.  The district court rejected this reason because \"the final report of the investigation had been completed and turned over to the State Attorney\\'s Office\" over a month before the personnel decision.  Record on Appeal, vol. 1 at 28.  However, the record evidence is overwhelming that the investigation was in fact continuing.  We thus conclude that this subsidiary finding also is clearly erroneous.  It is true that there is no evidence that Wardwell was suspected of wrongdoing at the time of the personnel decision.  However, it is also true that the investigation was ongoing.  It would not have been unreasonable for the School Board to decline to appoint anyone in that Department while the investigation was continuing;  such a reason obviously does not constitute discrimination.  If in fact this was the reason that the School Board did not appoint Wardwell, then Wardwell\\'s claim of discrimination would fail.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      Finally, since the district court must on remand address the intentional discrimination issue ab initio in any event, we direct that the court also address again the School Board\\'s other asserted reason, i.e., the alleged new policy of not appointing anyone to an acting position who might fill the permanent position.  We request that the district judge make an explicit finding whether or not Superintendent Mills did in fact have such a policy, whether formal or informal, written or oral, known widely or not;  and whether or not such policy, if it did exist, was a factor in Superintendent Mills\\' decision.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      Thus, on remand the district court shall make new findings of fact and conclusions of law on the intentional discrimination issue, taking the foregoing matters into particular attention.\\n    \\n    C. Constructive Discharge\\n    \\n      11\\n      The law in this circuit with respect to constructive discharge is well established.  To show constructive discharge, the employee must prove that his working conditions were so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee\\'s shoes would have felt compelled to resign.    Bourque v. Powell Electrical Manufacturing Co., 617 F.2d 61, 65 (5th Cir.1980);  Young v. Southwestern Savings &amp; Loan Ass\\'n, 509 F.2d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1975).2   The constructive discharge issue, being a question of fact, is subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.    See Buckley v. Hospital Corporation of America, 758 F.2d 1525, 1530-31 (11th Cir.1985) (treating constructive discharge as a question of fact for the jury to decide);  see also Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982) (discussing the distinction between questions of law and questions of fact).  Although there is evidence to support the district court\\'s finding of constructive discharge, because our review of the evidence leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that no reasonable person in Wardwell\\'s position would have felt compelled to resign, we hold that the district court\\'s finding that Wardwell had been constructively discharged is clearly erroneous.    See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      The trial judge, in his written findings, offered some factual support for his conclusion that Wardwell had been constructively discharged.  The district judge pointed out that Wardwell was qualified for the Acting Director position whereas Goode was not, and that Wardwell was given an inadequate explanation of the personnel decision.  Record on Appeal, vol. 1 at 28.  While the foregoing may be some evidence of discrimination, and while a discriminatory refusal to promote would be relevant to the issue of whether Wardwell was constructively discharged, such evidence is not always sufficient to support a finding of constructive discharge.    See Bourque, 617 F.2d at 65-66.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      In addition to the foregoing evidence of discrimination relied upon by the district court, Wardwell also argues on appeal that she was overburdened with work after Goode was appointed Acting Director.  This extra burden was in part the result of Goode\\'s inexperience with transportation matters and in part due to Wardwell\\'s already heavy workload.  Although we are satisfied that Wardwell was required to take on additional duties after Goode\\'s appointment, we note that even then she was working from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. five days a week.  There is no evidence in the record to suggest why the necessity to work these hours during the transition period here involved would pose an intolerable burden.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      After a careful review of this record, taking into consideration the specific evidence in this record from which it may or may not be inferred that the failure to promote Wardwell was discriminatory, and taking into consideration the above mentioned working conditions in her existing job, we have a definite and firm conviction that discrimination of this nature and working conditions of this nature cannot constitute the intolerable working conditions necessary to prove a constructive discharge.  While Wardwell may have been frustrated by her failure to be appointed Acting Director, and while this may have been a matter of some embarassment to her, these facts, together with her added workload, simply do not rise to the intolerable level at which a reasonable person would feel com-pelled to resign.  Thus, we conclude that the district court\\'s finding on the constructive discharge issue is clearly erroneous.\\n    \\n    II. CONCLUSION\\n    \\n      15\\n      Having reviewed the record designated for appeal and the applicable law, we hold that the district court\\'s finding of a pattern of a discrimination and its finding that Wardwell was constructively discharged are clearly erroneous.  We vacate the portion of the district court\\'s opinion regarding intentional discrimination and remand this issue for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      REVERSED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED with instructions.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      On April 22, 1986, this court issued a decision reversing as clearly erroneous the district court\\'s findings that appellants, the School Board of Palm Beach County, Florida and Superintendent Thomas J. Mills (collectively \"the School Board\") had engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination and had constructively discharged Mary Wardwell.  We also vacated the district court\\'s finding that the School Board had intentionally discriminated against Wardwell and remanded this issue for further proceedings.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      The School Board has moved to clarify our disposition of this case with respect to the district court\\'s injunction requiring the School Board to reinstate Wardwell as Assistant Director of Transportation.  Our conclusion that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding a constructive discharge necessarily means that the injunction requiring reinstatement must be vacated.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      The petition for rehearing is GRANTED to the extent that our previous opinion is amended to specify that the injunction requiring reinstatement is VACATED.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         This opinion sometimes refers to both appellants collectively as the \"School Board\" or the \"Board.\"\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         In Bonner v.

Specifically, the Union objects to the minority job referral levels that the extended decree requires.  Because we do not believe that the district court abused its discretion in extending the decree, including its referral requirements, for two additional years, we affirm.\\n    \\n    I.\\n    \\n      2\\n      The elaborate factual foundation for holding the Union liable in this case is recited at length in previous opinions that have emerged from this fourteen-year-old litigation.  The Union here challenges only the extended injunction imposed after the district court determined that the initial decree\\'s requirements had not been met.  Because the factual background is set forth extensively in prior opinions, we can treat the long history of this case briefly.  The most relevant facts for this appeal are the lower court\\'s findings of continuing discrimination and the provisions of the extended decree.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      The district court in 1978 found Local 542 liable for intentional, classwide discrimination against minority workers in violation of both Title VII and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981.   Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Local Union 542, Int\\'l Union of Operating Engineers, 469 F.Supp. 329 (E.D.Pa.1978), aff\\'d, 648 F.2d 922 (3d Cir.1981) (en banc).  The court found discrimination by the Union in entry into the Union as well as in job referrals from the Union\\'s exclusive hiring hall.  Id.  The court then entered an injunctive decree, effective November 7, 1979, to remedy the Union\\'s unlawful conduct.   Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Local Union 542, Int\\'l Union of Operating Engineers, 502 F.Supp. 7 (E.D.Pa.1979) (the injunction), aff\\'d, 648 F.2d 922 (3rd Cir.1981);  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Local Union 542, Int\\'l Union of Operating Engineers, 488 F.Supp. 988 (E.D.Pa.1980) (opinion in support of the injunction), aff\\'d, 648 F.2d 922 (3rd Cir.1981).  Contractors that relied on Local 542\\'s hiring hall were initially found vicariously liable by the district court, but the Supreme Court reversed this holding, General Building Contractors v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982), thus invalidating the part of the injunctive decree that applied to the class of contractors.  After this decision the obligations of the Union remained unchanged, except for the decree modifications discussed below.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      The injunctive decree\\'s ultimate objective was to achieve, at the end of its life, a level of hours worked by minority Union members commensurate with the percentage of minority persons in the local workforce population.  The decree established a different hours goal for each of five districts where the Union operated.  The hours goals increased over the five-year period of the initial decree.  To assure that the hours goals would be met, the district court imposed subsidiary obligations on the Union.  One of the subsidiary obligations, the referral level (specified for each district), established the rate at which minority members were to be referred to jobs from the Union hiring hall.  \"Referrals\" include dispatches from the hiring hall\\'s out-of-work lists and recalls of preferred employees by employers.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      The Union\\'s collective bargaining agreements give employers the right to recall a preferred employee during a 90-day period after the employee is laid off by the employer.  Thus during the recall period the employer can hire a Union member who is out of work but has worked previously for the employer, giving the employer some control over who is sent from the hiring hall.  If the employer does not recall a particular worker, the Union dispatches a member from its out-of-work list.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      At the outset, the referral levels of the injunction (i.e., the ratio of minority referrals to total referrals) were set at the same percentage as the yearly hours goals for each district (i.e., the ratio of minority hours worked to total hours worked), with a provision in the injunction that referral levels could later be increased if necessary to achieve the appropriate level of minority hours worked.  To reach a desired level of minority work hours, referral levels must be set higher if the number of hours worked per referral is on the average higher for white workers.  In this case, white Union members have consistently been referred to longer jobs.  When the district court found that the initial referral levels resulted in a shortfall in minority hours worked, the court altered the referral obligations.  Thus in 1983, the court set aside 22% of the referrals in District 1 for minority workers during the last two years of the initial decree, instead of 18%, the ultimate hours-worked goal for that district.  In 1984, the court raised the referral level in District 1 to 40% for the remainder of the initial decree\\'s life.  Of the injunction\\'s five districts, District 1 is the district with the greatest percentage of minorities, 18%, in its workforce population.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      As the years of the initial decree passed, the Union met neither the referral nor the hours-worked specifications of the decree.  The Union also did not comply with integrated membership and validation requirements.  The Master, appointed by the district court to oversee implementation of the decree, conducted evidentiary hearings in early 1985 and issued a detailed report that recommended inter alia extending the time period of the decree.  The Master\\'s Report states,\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      The purpose of the Judgment and Decree was to assure the plaintiff class of adequate representation within the construction industry and more particularly in the endeavors of Operating Engineers....  This purpose has not been met.  The Court found that the plaintiff class was entitled to this injunctive relief, and it is the finding of the Master after these years of experience, that the plaintiffs are still entitled to that relief and that the percentages mandated by the Court are reasonable goals.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      App. at 31.  On July 30, 1985, the district court heard argument on whether to accept the Master\\'s recommendations.  At the conclusion of this argument, the court issued an order dated August 1, 1985, extending the injunctive decree for two years, to August 31, 1987, subject to modifications to be made by the court.  An order dated October 9, 1985, sets out the district court\\'s findings and its modifications of the injunction.  The Union appeals from the August 1 and October 9, 1985, orders.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      The district court found \"a serious shortfall\" in the amount of work done by minorities during the last two years of the initial decree, the time period during which minorities were to achieve work levels commensurate with the number of minorities in the local workforce population.  App. at 671.  The court calculated that from September, 1983, to May, 1985, minority workers in District 1 and District 5 lost $4,101,727.00 in wages because of discrimination in the allocation of the Union\\'s work.  App. at 672.  Furthermore, the court found that since it had ordered 40% minority referrals for District 1, the referral level \"actually decreased to 26.5 percent in year 5 from 27.47 percent in year 4.\"    App. at 673 (emphasis in original).  The court concluded that the Union \"has continued to use the hiring hall as a tool of discrimination.\"    App. at 676.  It also found that \"Local 542, in blatant and confrontational contempt of the court mandates, has failed to do any of the validation work required of it.\"    App. at 677 (emphasis in original).  Finally, the court held the Union \"in contempt for failing to satisfy court mandates respecting work levels for minorities, as well as its failure to do the validation work.\"    App. at 677.  Judge Bechtle reasoned,\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      The degree of improvement is patently and substantially out of proportion to the levels of compliance that could have been achieved with the resources and experience, and time allowed by the court to perform.  The Union\\'s efforts have been mediocre, lackluster and, in the Court\\'s view, calculated to show the minimum of change at the least cost to the Union\\'s continuous program of wearisome and intentional racial discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      App. at 677-78 (emphasis in original).\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      The extended decree has as its ultimate goal, as did the initial decree, minority work hours that reflect the number of local minority workers.  To assist the Union in complying with the decree and ending discrimination, the extended decree requires the appointment of a Hiring Hall Monitor.  It also orders Felix Manual Lopez, Ph.D., to formulate a validation plan for non-discriminatory entry and promotion standards, at the Union\\'s expense.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      In addition, the extended decree maintains for two years the referral requirements established in 1984--40% minority referrals in District 1, for example, and 17% in District 5.  Because Judge Bechtle found \"that the employer recall provision in the collective bargaining agreement has had, and will continue to have, a material adverse impact on the Union\\'s ability to meet the goals of the Decree,\" however, he ordered that the recall provision be altered to restrict recalls to within 30 days from previous employment with a particular employer.  As noted earlier, the collective bargaining agreements as signed by the contractors and the Union give the employers the recall privilege for 90 days.  In modifying the initial decree Judge Bechtle further provided,\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      The Hiring Hall Monitor will have the authority to approve of or disapprove of all referrals, including hiring hall dispatches and employer recalls.  The Hiring Hall Monitor\\'s authority to approve a recall request by an employer which extends beyond the thirty (30) day recall period set by this Decree, shall be limited to \"truly extraordinary circumstances.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      App. at 681.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      The Union in these appeals challenges the extended referral requirements, arguing that the District 1 hiring hall must under the extended decree dispatch minority workers at a rate of 70%, that the referral requirements unjustifiably hurt white workers who may not have benefited unfairly from discrimination in the past, and that the employers, not the Union, are responsible for the minority work shortfall.  The Union emphasizes the Master\\'s finding with respect to the last years of the initial decree:\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      There were, in fact, enough minority operators available for work so that the 40 per cent referral could be met.  In order to achieve that, in excess of 70 per cent of all dispatches would have to be to minority operators....\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      * * *\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      Certainly, the fact that it would require in excess of 70 per cent of all dispatches from the hiring hall to be given to minorities and that each one of those dispatches would have required a job of some 199 hours in length, is evidence of the difficulty the Union experiences in trying to comply.  The plaintiffs point out, however, that such an effort on behalf of the Union was not even tried.  There was at no time dispatches of minorities approaching 70 per cent even though the testimony indicates there were minorities available for work, many on the out-of-work list, that could have been dispatched in order to meet the quotas.  It is also obvious to all parties involved and, essentially agreed to, that had the contractors been kept in the case, sharing the responsibility with the Union for meeting the hours and wages goal, that the effort would have been less onerous.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      App. at 18, 26 (emphasis in original).  The high dispatch level required to meet the decree\\'s referral goals resulted from the employers\\' practice of more frequently recalling white workers.  Because the practice of favoring whites for recalls continues, argues the Union, the extended decree imposes an unfair burden on Local 542 and on its white workers who are not recalled regularly.  The Union presents itself as powerless to control the employers\\' right to recall:\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      The recall right is a contractual prerogative that is jealously guarded by the employers, and plaintiffs offer no evidence to suggest that the Union has ever been deemed to have the right to reject a recall that is requested within the period specified by the contract (originally 90 days, and now 30 days).  Nor does anything in the Decree purport to authorize the Union to disregard the employers\\' contractual right to recall employees.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Appellant\\'s Reply Brief at 13-14 (footnote omitted).  Local 542 asks this court to vacate the extended decree\\'s referral requirements and to instruct the district court to set such requirements no higher than the percentage of minority members in the Union membership of each district.\\n    \\n    II.\\n    \\n      24\\n      Local 542 does not challenge the district court\\'s power to modify and extend its injunction.   See United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 252, 88 S.Ct. 1496, 1501, 20 L.Ed.2d 562 (1968) (district court should modify decree if required result not achieved).  Nor does the Union dispute the proposition that the Supreme Court has approved the use of affirmative, race-conscious remedies for persistent employment discrimination under some circumstances.  See Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, --- U.S. ----, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 92 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986) (holding that race-conscious goals are among tools available to judges devising remedies for Title VII violations, and citing Pennsylvania v. International Union of Op. Engineers, 770 F.2d 1068 (CA 3 1985) (this case), as example).  Finally, the Union does not challenge the district court\\'s findings of fact as clearly erroneous.  The Union does assert, however, that Judge Bechtle abused his discretion when he extended the race-conscious referral goals for two years, based on the injunction\\'s failure so far to achieve its goal of equal employment opportunity.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      We review the district court orders for abuse of discretion.   Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 770, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 1267, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976) (fashioning employment discrimination remedy invokes equitable discretion of district court).  Under the abuse of discretion standard, we may reverse the lower court only if the extended decree is arbitrary, capricious, or irrational, or it employs improper standards, criteria, or procedures.   See Hoots v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 703 F.2d 722, 725 (3d Cir.1983).  As the plurality opinion in Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers emphasizes, the district court\\'s discretion \"should be guided by sound legal principles.\"    106 S.Ct. at 3050.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Justice Brennan\\'s opinion and Justice Powell\\'s opinion in Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers, together expressing the views of five members of the Court, focus on several factors to be considered in determining the propriety of race-conscious, prospective relief for Title VII violations.  The affirmative race-conscious remedy in that case fit within Title VII\\'s authorization because it (1) addressed persistent, egregious, or pervasive discrimination, (2) was flexible in application, (3) constituted a temporary measure, and (4) failed to trammel unnecessarily the interests of white workers.  106 S.Ct. at 3050-52 (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, J., Blackmun, J., and Stevens, J.);    see also 106 S.Ct. at 3054 (Powell, J., concurring in the judgment) (\"in cases involving particularly egregious conduct a District Court may fairly conclude that [a negative] injunction alone is insufficient to remedy a proven violation of Title VII.  This is such a case.\").  In addition, the plurality found that the remedy satisfied \"even the most rigorous [equal protection] test--it is narrowly tailored to further the Government\\'s compelling interest in remedying past discrimination.\"    106 S.Ct. at 3053 (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, J., Blackmun, J., and Stevens, J.).  The plurality explicitly declined to hold, however, that this most stringent test was in fact the proper test to be applied in analyzing the constitutionality of race-conscious remedial measures.  106 S.Ct. at 3052-53.  In his determination that the remedy in Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers was narrowly tailored, Justice Powell relied on the lack of any other effective remedy, the temporary nature of the remedy, the direct relation between the goal and the percentage of minorities in the relevant workforce, the flexible application of the remedy, and its failure to disadvantage white workers.  106 S.Ct. at 3055-57.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      We examine the remedy in this case to see that it meets Justice Brennan\\'s four criteria for an appropriate remedy under Title VII and, as did the plurality, we assume that the Constitution requires a narrowly tailored remedy.  Although the referral levels here seem at first blush to be a more drastic remedy than the 29% membership goal in Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers, careful examination of the circumstances shows that this remedy is not at variance with the analysis used by the Supreme Court to uphold the membership goal.  In addition, the Union, focusing on injury to white workers and lack of fit between remedy and problem, has raised no consideration unanticipated by the Court in Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      Each factor that led to the affirmance in Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers is also present in the case before us.  First, Judge Bechtle\\'s memorandum in support of his orders makes clear that extending the decree addresses persistent discrimination.  He found that the hiring hall still serves as a \"tool of discrimination.\"    App. at 676.  The referral requirements have been extended by Judge Bechtle in an effort to end at last the Union\\'s proven discriminatory ways.  Therefore, they are not merely racial balancing measures, measures that the Court in Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers indicated would be inappropriate under Title VII.  106 S.Ct. at 3038 (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, J., Blackmun, J., and Stevens, J.)  (citing legislative history).\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      Second, Judge Bechtle treats the referral requirements as flexible goals rather than as strict quotas that can, in and of themselves, result in Union contempt citations.  In its October order the district court held the Union in contempt for failure to achieve work levels that, given the actual circumstances, could have been achieved.  Neither the failure to meet the minority hours goals nor the failure to meet the subsidiary referral goals mechanically triggered the contempt ruling.  Rather, the court sanctioned the Union for efforts \"calculated to show the minimum of change at the least cost to the Union\\'s continuous program of wearisome and intentional racial discrimination.\"    App. at 677-78.  Furthermore, the court has been flexible in setting the Union\\'s referral requirements and in aiding compliance with them.  Because the court found that the recall privilege frustrated the Union\\'s performance under the decree, it restricted this privilege in the course of extending the decree.  The court also stated that it would reevaluate the recall privilege\\'s impact after the 30-day time limit went into effect, and that it would make further adjustments if necessary.  App. at 675.  Referral levels have been repeatedly reexamined and have been set at the estimated level necessary for hours of minority work that match the percentage of minorities in the workforce population.1   The lower court uses the referral levels to gauge achievement of the ultimate goal, work levels consistent with overcoming the Union\\'s past discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      The court has shown its willingness to aid the Union in any way possible as Local 542 attempts to increase minority referrals and thus minority work, even to the point of doing away with the recall privilege altogether.  An injunctive decree under Title VII can alter the Union\\'s collective bargaining agreement if necessary to end discrimination.   General Building Contractors Ass\\'n, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 400, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 3155, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982) (this case).  During a January, 1986, conference, for example, the court and counsel for the Union had the following exchange:\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      The Court:  I agree with you, and I am glad to hear that the union is unhappy with the recall, because I am and the plaintiffs are and it will be easy to get rid of it.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      Mr. Collins:  We are unhappy with being held accountable for it.\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      The Court:  Well, you are.  You are in charge of the employment, and it has a lot of features to it.\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      * * *\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      We will just have to take it a step at a time and remove every obstacle in the way of the Court\\'s goal, and the Court will achieve it.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      Supp.App. at 37.  The Union has repeatedly asserted that the recall privilege must be preserved so that it can maintain its relations with employers.  Local 542 argues that contractors will not enter into collective bargaining agreements that lack a recall provision.  Judge Bechtle has weighed this consideration in determining the features of the extended decree.  The recall right has been preserved for 30 days after an employer lays off a Union member, but if necessary to achieve adequate minority referrals the new Hiring Hall Monitor has been given the power to deny any recall request.  These measures are indicative of the district court\\'s flexibility and caution in prescribing the means by which the Union will remedy its prior conduct and of the court\\'s concern that the Union not be made to endure unduly harsh measures because of any discriminatory actions by others.\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      Third, the court extended the decree as a temporary measure necessary to counteract continuing discrimination.  If the Union acts to comply with the decree, it will finally achieve appropriate minority work levels by the summer of 1987.  Since the decree expires on August 31, 1987, the court order in question will not serve to maintain a non-discriminatory situation.  Once the imbalance in work levels created by intentional discrimination is corrected, judicial enforcement will end.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      Fourth, the referral requirements do not interfere with the legitimate expectations of white workers.  To begin with, the Union\\'s 70% dispatch figure is misleading.  It relies on statistics gathered before Judge Bechtle reduced the recall period.  He reduced the recall period with the reasonable expectation that the change would decrease the number of jobs taken by recall (and thereby allow the Union to dispatch minority workers at a lower percentage rate and still meet the decree\\'s goals).  App. at 675.  The Hiring Hall Monitor\\'s new power should have the same effect of reducing the impact of white worker recalls.  The decree specifies referrals, not dispatches, and the referral levels range from .9% to 40%.  These are the percentages with which this Court must concern itself.\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      Courts have often set high referral or promotion levels in order to reach minority work levels commensurate with the proportion of minorities in the population.  The decree upheld in United States v. Int\\'l Union of Elevator Constructors, Local Union No. 5, 538 F.2d 1012 (3d Cir.1976), for example, provided for a union membership goal of 23% as well as a referral level of 33.33%.  As in the present case, modifications were made in the decree in Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police, 73 F.R.D. 370 (E.D.Pa.1976), because the effects of prior discrimination were not being eradicated under the initial decree.  The modified decree there set a goal of 9.2% minority corporals, sergeants, and lieutenants, with a promotion level set at 33.33% for minorities and a 50% rate of admitting minorities to each police academy class.  As in prior cases, the decree here aims for minority work proportionate to minorities in the population;  a 40% referral level in District 1 has become necessary to reach this goal.2\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      Most importantly, white workers dispatched more slowly than minority workers have no vested interest in the work hours that they are being denied.  These workers could expect excess work in the past because of the Union\\'s discriminatory behavior. The decree here does not interfere with a valid seniority system, as the remedy did do in a case heavily relied upon by the Union, Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U.S. 219, 102 S.Ct. 3057, 73 L.Ed.2d 721 (1982), but instead aims to correct the specific practices upon which the Union\\'s Title VII liability is based.  This court rejected the legitimacy of the Union\\'s past referral hierarchy in an earlier round of this litigation:\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      Here ... the referral system, which operates on seniority principles, was found by the district court to be not bona fide.  Indeed, it was found to be the very mechanism of the intentional race discrimination.  A seniority system which is created or maintained with discriminatory intent is by definition not bona fide.\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      App. at 658.  Basic principles of equity do not allow lucky individuals to continue to benefit directly from unlawful behavior once the illegality has been proven in court.  A temporary injunctive decree aimed at ridding the referral system of discrimination corrects injustices rather than imposing new ones, as the Union tries to suggest.\\n    \\n    \\n      43\\n      We agree wholeheartedly with the dissent that the impact on white workers must be considered here, but the dissent misconstrues \"the burden imposed on innocent nonminorities.\"    At 342.  The most important concern for both white and minority Union members who rely on the hiring hall for their livelihood is the number of hours worked, not the number of dispatches or recalls received.  By focusing on the delay in dispatching white workers that results from the decree, the dissent appears to lose sight of the fact that once on the job, white workers have been kept on the job for significantly longer periods of time, thereby earning considerably more take-home pay.  The district court raised the referral goals because of this development.  App. at 673 n. 6.  Thus although minority workers may remain out of work for shorter periods, they are often out of work and they continue to receive less than their share of the important commodity--their hourly wage.\\n    \\n    \\n      44\\n      Furthermore, contrary to the suggestions of the dissent, the burden imposed by the decree on nonminority Union members is spread among all of these workers.  The injunction speaks only of referrals, by any method, and of hours worked.  The extended decree in no way determines that certain white workers will be recalled consistently, while others must \"bat out of the hall.\"    If this is indeed the case--and the record does not substantiate it--there is no reason to believe it results from anything other than bona fide competition in the market for operating engineers.\\n    \\n    \\n      45\\n      Finally, the referral requirements were narrowly tailored by the district court to counteract discrimination in the allocation of work obtained through Local 542\\'s exclusive hiring hall.  An unchallenged finding of fact declares that minority workers have been denied their fair share of the hours worked by Union members.  In ordering the Union to refer minority workers at a rate that will give those discriminated against in the past an appropriate share of the work, the court is remedying this discrimination in the only way possible given the nature of the industry.  When it first imposed the affirmative, race-conscious requirements of the initial injunction, the district court stated, \"There is simply no other way, given the circumstances of this case, to effectively remedy the discrimination found here.\"    488 F.Supp. at 993.  This conclusion was affirmed by this Court when the case was first here.  The district court has expanded the decree only after it became clear that greater enforcement efforts were necessary to guarantee relief from the Union\\'s illegal conduct.\\n    \\n    \\n      46\\n      We share a number of the concerns expressed in the dissent of Judge Cowen.  We find ourselves in disagreement with the dissent, however, because we believe the efforts of the district judge equitably to reconcile the conflicting interests before him must be judged on the basis of the record and posture of this case when he was called upon to make the decision we here review.  The issue, as we see it, is not whether it would be preferable to have a sufficient record to determine whether employer discrimination is currently taking place and, if so, whether it would be preferable for someone to join one or more employers.  Rather, the issue is whether, given the record in this case, the district judge abused his discretion when he extended the decree for two years in an effort to secure for the plaintiffs the fair share of working hours which they previously had been found to deserve.\\n    \\n    \\n      47\\n      In 1961, the Union insisted upon and won a hiring hall system which forced the channeling of all employment opportunities with contractors in the industry through the hands of the Union.  The record in this case shows that the Union has deliberately manipulated that system to the plaintiffs\\' detriment for over two decades during which period the white members of the Union have received far more than their fair share of working hours and wages.  In 1979, the district court held that plaintiffs were entitled to a remedy that would result in their obtaining working hours proportionate to the minority representation in the workforce;  that decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court.\\n    \\n    \\n      48\\n      It was in this context that the hearings were held which culminated in the extension of the decree.  In those hearings the Union conceded that after five years of waiting the plaintiffs had not secured the relief to which they were entitled.  Moreover, the plaintiffs\\' evidence demonstrated, as the court found, that the Union could have complied with the referral requirements and this would likely have provided plaintiffs with their fair share of working hours.  When called upon to explain why it had not done so, the Union only pointed to the fact that, under the 90-day recall provision, the employers controlled 56% of the hours worked through recall and only 13%, rather than 18%, of the recalls went to minority workers.  The Union did not tender evidence tending to show what phenomenon or phenomena are producing this statistical disparity.  Judge Cowen posits four plausible candidates, three of which can be attributed to the Union and one of which cannot.  The difficulty with the dissent\\'s point is that on this record, one can only speculate as to there being any discrimination by anyone other than the Union.  As the Master stressed in his report, when asked to explain why it had not given plaintiffs their due, the Union produced \"no evidence\" that recalls by any employer or employers had been the result of discrimination on the employer\\'s part.\\n    \\n    \\n      49\\n      Despite the failure of the Union to produce any evidence of employer discrimination, the district court was sensitive to the problem that the 90-day recall provision created for the Union.  It agreed to take steps to reduce the number of hours controlled by the employer and gave the Hiring Hall Monitor authority to deny any recall request.  If the Union obtains information indicating that one or more employers are engaging in discrimination, it is free to seek further interim aid from the district court.  Moreover, if it obtains such information, it will owe an affirmative duty to its minority members to take action against the offending employer or employers to enforce the non-discrimination provisions of its collective bargaining agreements.   Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 777 F.2d 113 (3d Cir.1985).  Contrary to the suggestion of the Union, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the extension of the decree worked a change by which the discriminating Union became the helpless victim of employer discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      50\\n      The extended decree issued by the district court mandates the type of affirmative, race-conscious relief contemplated by the Supreme Court in Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers.3   The referral requirements in this case violate neither Title VII nor the Constitution.  They are part of a flexible, well-designed district court plan to end protracted discrimination.  Local 542\\'s allegations of inequity lack merit.  Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the orders in question.  Consequently, the extended decree will be affirmed.\\n    \\n    COWEN, District Judge, dissenting:\\n    \\n      51\\n      Providing an effective remedy for racial discrimination remains one of the most important tasks of the federal courts.  Nevertheless, when a federal court promulgates a decree that distinguishes between individuals on the basis of race, the decree must be narrowly tailored to the violations it seeks to correct and must respect the legitimate interests of all affected by it.  Since the decree in this case is not narrowly tailored and fails to adequately respect the legitimate interests of nonminority members of Local 542, I respectfully dissent.\\n    \\n    \\n      52\\n      * In Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, --- U.S. ----, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 92 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986) the Supreme Court held that affirmative, race-conscious remedies are sometimes appropriate even if individuals who are not identifiable victims of past discrimination benefit thereby.\\n    \\n    \\n      53\\n      A plurality of four Justices (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, J., Blackmun, J., and Stevens, J.) specifically noted that they \"do not mean to suggest that such relief is always proper.\"    106 S.Ct. at 3050.  Instead, although acknowledging that the fashioning of appropriate remedies invokes the equitable discretion of the district court, the plurality\\n    \\n    \\n      54\\n      emphasize[d] that a court\\'s judgment should be guided by sound legal principles.  In particular, the court should exercise its discretion with an eye towards Congress\\' concern that race-conscious affirmative measures not be invoked simply to create a racially balanced work force.\\n    \\n    Id.  The plurality also noted that\\n    \\n      55\\n      a court should consider whether affirmative action is necessary to remedy past discrimination in a particular case before imposing such measures, and that the court should also take care to tailor its orders to fit the nature of the violation it seeks to correct.\\n    \\n    \\n      56\\n      Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      57\\n      Justice Powell, whose fifth vote was essential to the judgment of the court, agreed that a race-conscious remedy must be narrowly tailored.  106 S.Ct. at 3050 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).1   Unlike the plurality, which rested on general equitable principles for this conclusion, Justice Powell relied on equal protection doctrine.  Id.  Thus all five Justices who upheld the particular remedy at issue in Local 28 stated that a federal court may not impose a race-conscious remedy unless that remedy is tailored to fit the nature of the violation it seeks to correct.\\n    \\n    \\n      58\\n      To understand the problems with the remedy crafted by the district court in this case, three terms regarding the operation of the hiring hall must be explained:\\n    \\n    \\n      59\\n      Dispatch refers to the practice of an employer calling the hiring hall with a job to fill.  The union is to send out the next qualified member on the applicable out-of-work list.\\n    \\n    \\n      60\\n      Recall refers to the practice of an employer calling back a particular union member who has recently worked for him.\\n    \\n    \\n      61\\n      Referral, as used in the court decrees, was interpreted in September of 1984 to include both dispatches and recalls.\\n    \\n    \\n      62\\n      See App. at 645.\\n    \\n    \\n      63\\n      The original decree in this case was scheduled to expire by its own terms on August 31, 1985.  Plaintiffs sought an extension of the decree because, although the decree (after modifications in 1983 and 1984) required that they work 18% of the hours and receive 40% of the referrals, they were not receiving the required hours and referrals.  (For convenience, all percentage references are to District 1, the district with the highest percentage of minorities.)    It is undisputed that the union was giving 40% of its dispatches to minorities.  However, only 13% of recalls by employers went to minorities.  Minorities, therefore, did not receive the 40% referral rate required by the court.  The district court specifically stated that \"without the employer recall feature, the Union would have met the court mandated 40% minority referrals.\"    App. at 674.\\n    \\n    \\n      64\\n      Assuming, as is likely, that racial discrimination is involved, there are four possible explanations for the shortfall in minority referrals despite the 40% minority dispatch rate:\\n    \\n    \\n      65\\n      1) the union continued to discriminate by manipulating the dispatches in order to give more desirable jobs (i.e. jobs with a greater likelihood of producing a recall) to nonminorities;\\n    \\n    \\n      66\\n      2) the union continued to discriminate by providing inadequate training to minorities and thereby rendering them less attractive to employers;\\n    \\n    \\n      67\\n      3) the effects of prior union discrimination were not dissipated because employers need time before they are sufficiently familiar with an employee\\'s work that they are likely to recall him;\\n    \\n    \\n      68\\n      4) employers discriminated against minorities.\\n    \\n    \\n      69\\n      If union manipulation was the cause of the shortfall, then it is certainly appropriate to impose a remedy on the union.  Indeed, Judge Higginbotham premised his finding of discrimination in part upon the failure of the union to adhere to its own rules governing referrals from the out-of-work lists.  (\"The union procedure in general constituted a motley fabric of arbitrary departures from the rules.\"    469 F.Supp. at 381).  However, although the district court in extending the decree found that the union \"has continued to use the hiring hall as a tool of discrimination,\" App. at 676, the court did not explain this statement or point to any evidence of manipulation.  Rather, it appears that the district court based this conclusion on the fact of the referral shortfall itself.2   The majority makes precisely the same error in concluding that \"[t]he referral requirements have been extended ... in an effort to end at last the Union\\'s proven discriminatory ways.\"    Majority at 335.\\n    \\n    \\n      70\\n      Similarly, if the cause of the shortfall is the inadequate training of minorities by the union, further remedial action by the union is necessary.  However, if inadequate training is the cause, the remedy should be focused on training and not on dispatches.\\n    \\n    \\n      71\\n      If the referral shortfall is one of \"the lingering effects of pervasive discrimination,\" further remedial requirements placed on the union may be appropriate.   See Local 28, 106 S.Ct. at 3050 (plurality opinion).\\n    \\n    \\n      72\\n      On the other hand, if employer discrimination is the cause of the shortfall, then there is simply no justification on this record to hold the union responsible.  It is clear that employers control the number of hours worked per referral and that they have kept white workers on the job longer.  See Majority at 331.  It is also clear that employers more frequently recall white workers.  See Majority at 333.  Certainly these facts suggest the possibility of employer discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      73\\n      The district court did not explore which of the foregoing possible causes actually caused the shortfall.  In the absence of such an inquiry, the possibility is all too real that the union is being held responsible for remedying the employers\\' discrimination.  The majority concludes that since the union did not prove employer discrimination, this possibility is of no concern.  Yet the majority concedes that \"one can only speculate\" as to the cause of the shortfall.  Majority at 338.  Such a remedy cannot be considered narrowly tailored to fit the violation it seeks to correct.\\n    \\n    II\\n    \\n      74\\n      Both the plurality and the concurrence in Local 28 stated plainly that a race-conscious remedy cannot be imposed which unnecessarily trammels the interests of nonminorities.  106 S.Ct. at 3052 (plurality);  106 S.Ct. at 3055 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment);  see also Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, --- U.S. ----, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986).  The majority declares that the interests of white workers are not legitimate and asserts that \"[t]hese workers could expect excess work in the past because of the Union\\'s discriminatory behavior.\"    Majority at 336 (emphasis in original).3   There are two serious flaws in this reasoning.\\n    \\n    \\n      75\\n      First, the majority assumes, without any factual foundation, that the nonminority employees who rely on dispatches for work are the same individuals who received more than their fair share of dispatches in the past.  Certainly the interests of an individual who did not receive such benefits from discrimination cannot be brushed aside as illegitimate.\\n    \\n    \\n      76\\n      Second, and perhaps more fundamental, the majority\\'s analysis is apparently based upon a misunderstanding of the nature of the interest involved.  Under the hiring hall procedures embodied in the collective bargaining agreement, a worker is to be dispatched based on the length of time he has been out of work:  the longer he is out of work the sooner he can expect to be dispatched.  This interest is entirely independent of any prior discrimination.4\\n    \\n    \\n      77\\n      It is true that in the past the union disregarded the rules of the dispatch system in a racially discriminatory manner.  Absent a finding that such behavior continues, however, the interests created by the equitable system of \"first laid off, first re-hired\" must be considered legitimate.5\\n    \\n    \\n      78\\n      Nor can the majority rely on this court\\'s prior opinion regarding the applicability of Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 104 S.Ct. 2576, 81 L.Ed.2d 483 (1984).  See Majority at 335.  In distinguishing Stotts from this case, the prior decision correctly noted that this case does not involve a bona fide seniority system.  App. at 658-59.  However, simply because the nonminority workers have no legitimate interests based on seniority does not mean that they have no legitimate interests at all;  nor does it mean that they have no legitimate interests based on the length of time they have been out of work.\\n    \\n    \\n      79\\n      Once the interests of nonminority workers are recognized, at least in part, to be legitimate, it is necessary to determine whether those interests have been sufficiently respected by the decree.  Two interrelated factors must be considered:  the seriousness of the burden imposed and the diffuseness of that burden.\\n    \\n    \\n      80\\n      In Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, --- U.S. ----, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986), the Supreme Court held that a race-conscious system of determining layoffs violated the Equal Protection Clause.  Although no opinion commanded a majority of the Court,6 the plurality emphasized that being laid off from a job is far more burdensome than not being hired in the first place.  A layoff can severely disrupt an individual\\'s life while a hiring goal, like a school admissions goal, often forecloses only one of several possibilities.  106 S.Ct. at 1851-52.  Similarly, the plurality emphasized that a layoff imposes the entire burden on the particular individuals laid off while a hiring goal diffuses that burden among all potential applicants.  Because of the severe burden imposed on particular individuals, the plurality concluded that the layoffs violated the Equal Protection Clause.  Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      81\\n      The decision in Wygant largely foreshadowed the decision on Local 28.  Local 28 involved a membership goal rather than layoffs.  The plurality noted that the membership goal \"did not require any member of the union to be laid off, and did not discriminate against existing union members.\"    106 S.Ct. at 3053 (emphasis in original).  Justice Powell analogized a membership goal to a hiring goal and specifically relied on the plurality opinion in Wygant for the proposition that a hiring goal typically imposes a less severe and more diffuse burden than a layoff.  106 S.Ct. at 3057.\\n    \\n    Justice Powell also stated:\\n    \\n      82\\n      Of course, it is too simplistic to conclude from the combined holdings of Wygant and this case that hiring goals withstand constitutional muster whereas layoff goals ... do not.  There may be cases, for example, where a hiring goal in a particularly specialized area of employment would have the same pernicious effect as the layoff goal in Wygant.    The proper constitutional inquiry focuses on the effect, if any, and the diffuseness of the burden imposed on innocent nonminorities, not on the label applied to the particular employment plan at issue.\\n    \\n    \\n      83\\n      106 S.Ct. at 3057, n. 3.\\n    \\n    \\n      84\\n      In this case, the burden imposed on innocent nonminorities individuals is heavy:  each nonminority worker is dispatched to work far less often than each minority worker.  For a worker who must \"bat out of the hall,\" relying on such dispatches to earn a living, the impact is clearly severe.  The burden if far more analogous to a layoff than to a hiring since the impact is not simply on one option among many, but rather on all options for union work in his chosen trade in the geographical area.  Indeed, the employment practice at issue is simply one aspect of a layoff:  the decision as to who gets summoned back to work after a layoff.  Certainly the defendant board of education in Wygant, after laying-off teachers without regard to race in compliance with the Supreme Court\\'s decision, could not call those teachers back to work on a racial basis.\\n    \\n    \\n      85\\n      In addition, the burden is not diffused at all.  It is not diffused among all potential applicants for jobs as operating engineers.  It is not even diffused among all current operating engineers, since those operating engineers who have either long-term jobs with particular employing contractors or good relationships with contractors and therefore get recalls do not share in the burden.  Instead the burden is placed squarely on the shoulders of those least able to bear it:  those workers who do not have a good relationship with contractors and therefore must \"bat out of the hall.\"    The majority callously refers to these people as \"lucky individuals [who] continue to benefit directly from unlawful behavior.\"    Majority at 337.  I suggest that these workers, far from being \"lucky,\" are among the least fortunate of all operating engineers and yet are made to bear the entire burden of achieving the court\\'s goal.\\n    \\n    \\n      86\\n      A member of the Local 542 legitimately expects that he will return to work after a layoff as soon as a job that he can do is available, provided he has been out of work longer than anyone else on his out-of-work list.  This legitimate interest is unnecessarily trammelled by the court\\'s decree since particular individuals are forced to bear a severe burden.\\n    \\n    III\\n    \\n      87\\n      There is a more general problem with the approach taken by the district court since the case was remanded by the Supreme Court.  The issues presented on this appeal all stem from this more general problem.\\n    \\n    \\n      88\\n      I agree with the majority that when Judge Higginbotham fashioned the original decree, the \"ultimate objective was to achieve, at the end of [the decree\\'s] life, a level of hours worked by minority Union members commensurate with the percentage of minority persons in the local workforce population.\"    Majority at 331.  Judge Higginbotham was acutely aware that what really mattered in the end was wages and hours.  He wrote:\\n    \\n    \\n      89\\n      In the final analysis, the brilliant briefs of counsel, the flash of eloquent arguments, the citations in the future to their case as significant precedent, and even the drama of a packed courtroom will never be adequate mementos for the victims of discrimination who desire money and jobs now.\\n    \\n    \\n      90\\n      488 F.Supp. 988, 991 (emphasis in original).\\n    \\n    \\n      91\\n      I also agree that the referral levels, among other requirement, were subsidiary obligations designed to aid in achieving the hours goals.  See Majority at 331.  As the majority correctly notes, the decree also provided that referral levels could be increased if necessary to reach the appropriate levels of hours worked.  See Majority at 331.  Such a structure for the decree made eminent sense at the time since the decree imposed obligations on both the union and the contractors in order to achieve the ultimate goal.\\n    \\n    \\n      92\\n      However, the Supreme Court determined that no significant obligations could be imposed on the contractors since it had not been proven that they engaged in intentional discrimination.  458 U.S. 375, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982).  On remand, the district court simply sought to achieve the same ultimate goal without the presence of the contractors.  Taking advantage of the provision in the original decree for adjustment of referral goals, the district court gradually increased the referral goals in an attempt to reach the requisite hours.  Along the way, the court defined referrals to include recalls.  I believe that this approach was fundamentally misguided, based on a misinterpretation of the original decree, and failed to follow the path charted for the district court by the Supreme Court\\'s decision.\\n    \\n    \\n      93\\n      The approach was fundamentally misguided because it insisted on achieving a goal which required the actions of both the union and the contractors even though the contractors were no longer bound.7   This flaw is highlighted by the difficulties the court has had with the recall provision in the collective bargaining agreement.  There is no doubt that the recall provision is a major obstacle to achievement of the hours goals of the decree.8   Only 13% of the recalls by contractors are for minority workers, even though 40% of the dispatched workers which the contractors receive from the union are members of minority groups.\\n    \\n    \\n      94\\n      In order to deal with this problem, the district court reduced the recall period from 90 days to 30 days.  The majority emphasizes that the district court \"has shown its willingness to aid the Union ... even to the point of doing away with the recall provisions altogether.\"    Majority at 335.  But what would happen if the district court were to totally eliminate the recall provision?    It is undisputed that the contractors only agreed to a hiring hall arrangement if they retained the right to recall.  Indeed, a ten week strike was required to compel the contractors to accede to the hiring hall at all.  See 458 U.S. at 378-89, 102 S.Ct. 3143-44.  If recall were eliminated and the hiring hall arrangement discontinued, it seems obvious that the union, without the contractors\\' presence, could not achieve the hours goals.  The district court is therefore caught in a balancing act:  it uses the hiring hall to approach the hours goals despite the actions of the contractors, but cannot go too far lest it risk losing the only handle it has on achieving those goals.\\n    \\n    \\n      95\\n      The district court has also interpreted the term \"referrals\" to include recalls.  I believe that this is a misinterpretation of the original decree.  The use of the term \"referrals\" in the original decree itself suggests that it does not include recalls.  Paragraph 14, which concerns referrals, only mentions out-of-work lists.  See 502 F.Supp. at 10.  Out-of-work lists are relevant only to dispatches.\\n    \\n    \\n      96\\n      Moreover, nowhere in Judge Higginbotham\\'s discussion of the evidence of discrimination in referrals is there any suggestion that recalls are included.  The entire discussion focuses on out-of-work lists, which, as noted above, are relevant only to dispatches.  See 469 F.Supp. 355-57.  Indeed, the only mention of the term \"recall\" which I have located in Judge Higginbotham\\'s entire liability opinion (which occupies ninety-one pages in the Federal Supplement) indicates that his understanding of \"referral\" did not include dispatches.  In describing the hiring hall system, he wrote:\\n    \\n    \\n      97\\n      Other restrictions pertaining to referral are the three refusal rule and the 90 day no-recall rule.  An operating engineer who refuses without excuse an offer of employment three consecutive times is to be placed at the bottom of his out-of-work list.  No employer is to recall outside the referral system after 90 days of separation.\\n    \\n    \\n      98\\n      469 F.Supp. at 340, n. 5.  (emphasis added).\\n    \\n    \\n      99\\n      Lastly, the district court on remand failed to follow the path charted for it by the Supreme Court\\'s decision.  The Court specifically stated:\\n    \\n    \\n      100\\n      If the Union and the JATC [Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee] comply with the decree by training and referring minority workers, we see no reason, absent supporting evidence, that the employers will not hire the minority workers referred pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, and employ them at wages and hours commensurate with those of nonminority workers.  If experience proves otherwise, the District Court will then have more than sufficient grounds for including the employers within the scope of the remedial decree.\\n    \\n    \\n      101\\n      458 U.S. at 400, 102 S.Ct. at 3155.\\n    \\n    \\n      102\\n      The union has complied with the original decree\\'s referral requirements by its level of performance in dispatching minority workers.  No issues concerning training obligations are currently before the court.  It is incumbent upon the district court to determine whether it is the lack of adequate training by the union or the JATC, racial discrimination by the contractors, or some other cause, which is producing the shortfall.  If the reason for the shortfall is failure of the union or the JATC to comply with the decree\\'s training requirements, then strong measures are appropriate to compel compliance.  If, however, the reason for the shortfall is contractor discrimination, then, as the Supreme Court foresaw, it is time to bring the contractors back into the case.\\n    \\n    IV\\n    \\n      103\\n      For the reasons explained above, I would vacate the extended decree\\'s referral requirements and remand for a determination of the cause of the disparity between the dispatch rate on the one hand and the recall rate and hours percentage on the other hand.  I would also instruct the district court to respect the legitimate interests of nonminority workers in any new remedial decree.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        *\\n         Honorable Robert E. Cowen, United States District Judge for the District of New Jersey, sitting by designation\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         Thus both the referral levels and the hours-worked goals are \"directly related to the percentage of nonwhites in the relevant workforce,\" an aspect of appropriate remedies emphasized by Justice Powell.  106 S.Ct. at 3056\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         The original referral goals, approved by this court in 1981, ranged from .7% to 18%.  When the Union challenged the injunctive decree under Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 104 S.Ct. 2576, 81 L.Ed.2d 483 (1984), the decree as upheld by this court included the very same referral levels now directly challenged.   Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Local Union 542, Int\\'l Union of Operating Engineers, 770 F.2d 1068 (3d Cir.1985) (table), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 106 S.Ct. 803, 88 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986)\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Justice Brennan\\'s opinion cites the recent Third Circuit Court of Appeals decision in this case upholding this injunction, including the current referral requirements, for the proposition that racial preferences are appropriate under certain circumstances.  106 S.Ct. at 3037 (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, J., Blackmun, J., and Stevens, J.)\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         Justice Powell also stated that the percentages set should be \"directly related to the percentage of nonwhites in the relevant workforce.\"    106 S.Ct. at 3056.  In this case, the 40% referral rate in District 1 is double the approximately 20% of the relevant population who are members of the minority groups.  The majority concludes that the \"direct relationship\" requirement is met because the 40% referral rate was set in order to achieve hours commensurate with the percentage of minorities in the relevant population.  I question whether this is the sort of \"direct relationship\" which Justice Powell had in mind.  Because I would rest on other grounds, I need not reach this issue.  Further elucidation may be forthcoming from the Supreme Court in the near future.  See U.S. v. Paradise, No. 85-999 (argued November 12, 1986)\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         Moreover, the union does not challenge on appeal the decision by the district court to appoint a monitor to run the hiring hall.  A court-appointed monitor in the hiring hall can certainly prevent any manipulation by the union\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         The majority also states that \"the impact on white workers must be considered.\"    Majority at 337.  I do not understand why the \"impact\" on those whose interests are deemed illegitimate must be considered\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         There may be some interests which nonminorities have in the dispatch system which can be considered illegitimate because they are based on prior discrimination.  Separate out-of-work lists are maintained for different levels of experience.  In addition, a worker without the specific skills an employer demands for a specific job can be bypassed on the applicable out-of-work list.  To the extent that a nonminority worker has greater skills and experience because of prior discrimination, his interests can be discounted.  This conclusion, however, does not undermine the legitimacy of his interests based solely on his length of time out of work\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         The majority\\'s reasoning can also be read to suggest that once a procedure is tainted by discrimination, even a non-discriminatory use of that procedure is illegitimate.  Such a conclusion is simply unsupportable\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         Justice Marshall, joined by Justices Brennan and Blackmun, commented:  \"I do not envy the District Court its task of sorting out what this Court has and has not held today.\"    106 S.Ct. at 1867\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         It is ironic that the majority quotes Judge Higginbotham\\'s statement that \"[t]here is simply no other way, given the circumstances of the case, to effectively remedy the discrimination found here.\"    Majority at 337.  That statement referred to a decree that included both the union and the contractors.  It certainly does not support the proposition that the decree as originally crafted could properly be imposed on the union alone\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         It is not the only obstacle.

Jordan argues that, although he received notice that his\\n\\ntermination had been recommended on May 10, 2005, Director of Fleet\\n\\nManagement Terry Gaddis assured him that the recommendation was not yet\\n\\neffective because the City of Montgomery Personnel Department (\u201cPersonnel\\n\\nBoard\u201d) had the sole authority to terminate employees. As a result, Jordan\\n\\ncontends that his termination from employment did not become final until after the\\n\\nPersonnel Board upheld the Mayor of Montgomery\u2019s decision to terminate him on\\n\\nappeal. Jordan notes that, based on the advice he received from Gaddis, he did not\\n\\nfile a charge of discrimination with the Equal Opportunity Employment\\n\\nCommission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) until after his termination was approved by the Personnel\\n\\nBoard, and argues that the advice effectively tolled the 180-day filing period.\\n\\nAccordingly, Jordan contends that, based on this evidence, a genuine issue of\\n\\nmaterial fact exists concerning the timeliness of his EEOC charge.\\n\\n      For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.\\n\\n      We review the district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment de novo.

Thus, in\\n\\norder to be considered timely, the alleged adverse employment action forming the\\n\\nbasis of that charge must have occurred on or after June 23, 2005. The record\\n\\nindicates that Gaddis advised Jordan that he had recommended Jordan\u2019s dismissal\\n\\n                                          4\\n\\x0cfrom employment on March 17, 2005.

Additionally, Jordan does not dispute that the Mayor terminated his\\n\\nemployment, effective May 10, 2005, or contest that the Mayor had the sole\\n\\nauthority to appoint and terminate city employees. The record further indicates\\n\\nthat Jordan received notice of his termination before June 23, 2005, as evidenced\\n\\nby his appeal to the Personnel Board, which was heard on June 20, 2005. Because\\n\\nJordan\u2019s appeal to the Personnel Board did not serve to toll the 180-day limitations\\n\\nperiod, and the evidence in the record indicates that Jordan received unequivocal\\n\\nnotice of his termination before June 23, 2003, his EEOC charge was untimely.\\n\\nSee Ricks, 449 U.S. at 261, 101 S.Ct. at 506; Wright, 320 F.3d at 1201.\\n\\nAccordingly, because Jordan failed to file a timely charge of discrimination with\\n\\nthe EEOC, his claims under Title VII are barred, and the district court did not err\\n\\nby granting the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\\n\\n      In light of the foregoing, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in\\n\\nfavor of the City is\\n\\n      AFFIRMED.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         5\\n\\x0c', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 62460}]"},{"id":35241,"date_filed":"2004-05-04","judges":"Garwood, Jones, Stewart","case_name_full":"Pamela L.

JONES, Circuit Judge:\\n    \\n    \\n      1\\n      Northlake Christian School (NCS) attempted to forestall strife with its newly-hired principal Pamela Prescott by entering into an employment contract for \"biblically-based mediation\" or arbitration under the auspices of the Institute for Christian Conciliation, these methods being prescribed as the \"sole remedy\" for any controversy. When the school\\'s relationship with Prescott deteriorated, however, Prescott filed suit. The district court ordered ADR. Mediation occurred, then arbitration; NCS appealed a highly adverse and somewhat dubious award back to the court; NCS appealed to this court; and we are forced to remand for further proceedings. So much for saving money and relationships through alternative dispute resolution. Perfect justice is not always found in this world.\\n    \\n    I. BACKGROUND\\n    \\n      2\\n      NCS hired Prescott as its elementary\/preschool principal for the 1999-2000 school year. In a written employment contract, the parties agreed \"in conformity with the biblical injunctions of 1 Corinthians 6:1-8, Matthew 5:23,24, and Matthew 18:15-20... that any claim or dispute arising out of, or related to, this agreement or to any aspect of the employment relationship\" would be referred to \"biblically-based mediation\" and, if unsuccessful, binding arbitration. The agreement specified that \"the arbitration process shall be conducted in accordance with the current Rules of Procedure for Christian Conciliation of the Institute for Christian Conciliation.\" Moreover, the parties waived \"their respective rights to file a lawsuit against one another in any civil court for such disputes, except to enforce a legally binding arbitration decision.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      In the spring of 2000, NCS told Prescott her contract would not be renewed for the following year and instructed her to vacate the premises of the school by March 31, 2000. She was placed on administrative leave for the duration of the school year contract and was paid her full salary and benefits throughout the contract term.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      In February 2001, Prescott filed suit against NCS, its board of directors, and its chief administrator in federal court. She asserted claims for Title VII gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation, violation of the Louisiana Whistleblower Protection Act, LA. R.S. &#167; 23:967 (2003), and breach of contract. NCS moved to compel arbitration. The court granted NCS\\'s motion, stayed Prescott\\'s suit, and administratively closed the case.1\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      To submit their dispute to arbitration, following the failure of mediation, the parties executed a form mediation\/arbitration agreement furnished by the ICC. They agreed to be governed by ICC rules, which included conducting the arbitration pursuant to the Montana Uniform Arbitration Act (\"MUAA\"). Most important, the parties interlineated the agreement in two places. First, the agreement originally provided that all communications, written or oral, \"between the parties during the mediation and\/or arbitration process shall be inadmissible in a court of law or for legal discovery.\" The parties crossed out the \"and\/or arbitration\" language, presumably making such communications admissible in a court of law. Second, on Prescott\\'s initiative, the parties added and initialed a hand-written provision, which stated: \"No party waives appeal rights, if any, by signing this agreement.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      After an unsuccessful attempt at mediation, the parties proceeded before a single ICC arbitrator. Over a six-day period, the arbitrator heard testimony from a multitude of witnesses and reviewed the evidence and affidavits submitted by the parties. On June 14, 2002, the arbitrator determined that NCS had failed to resolve its conflict with Prescott in accordance with Matthew 18, and other biblical scriptures, which he held were incorporated into the terms of Prescott\\'s employment contract.2 The arbitrator rendered judgment in favor of Prescott on her breach of contract claim and awarded her $157,856.52 for damage to her reputation and for future loss of income.3 The arbitrator also awarded NCS $786.46 for past due COBRA payments. NCS filed a motion to reconsider with the ICC administrator.4 The arbitrator denied the motion.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      NCS next moved to vacate the arbitration award in federal court, and argued, inter alia, that the handwritten amendments to the arbitration agreement expanded the federal court\\'s scope of review. Under this expanded scope of review, NCS urged the district court to vacate the arbitration award, as a matter of law, because Prescott was not wrongfully terminated, and she was not entitled to damages. The district court disagreed and concluded that the \"if any\" language \"merely preserves whatever appeal rights are statutorily granted under the MUAA.\" The district court rejected NCS\\'s substantive claims under the MUAA\\'s narrow scope of review. NCS now appeals that decision to this court.\\n    \\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n    \\n      8\\n      On a motion to vacate an arbitration award, we review the district court\\'s findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. Harris v. Parker College of Chiropractic, 286 F.3d 790, 791 (5th Cir.2002). Normally, the district court\\'s review of an arbitration award, under the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), is \"extraordinarily narrow.\" Antwine v. Prudential Bache Securities, Inc., 899 F.2d 410, 413 (5th Cir.1990)(stating that, under the FAA, \"courts should defer to the arbitrator\\'s decision when possible\") (citations omitted).5 The scope of judicial review is equally narrow under the MUAA.6 The MUAA also permits modification of an arbitration award under limited circumstances.7\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      In the instant case, we are called upon to determine whether the parties\\' arbitration agreement expanded the scope of judicial review beyond that provided in the MUAA. The district court\\'s interpretation of a contract, including the initial determination whether the contract is ambiguous, is a conclusion of law. American Totalisator Co., Inc. v. Fair Grounds Corp., 3 F.3d 810, 813 (5th Cir.1993); Thrift v. Hubbard, 44 F.3d 348, 357 (5th Cir.1995). If the contract is ambiguous, then \"the determination of the parties\\' intent through the extrinsic evidence is a question of fact.\" Watkins v. Petro-Search, Inc., 689 F.2d 537, 538 (5th Cir.1982).\\n    \\n    III. DISCUSSION\\n    \\n      10\\n      NCS offers several arguments on appeal: (1) the arbitration agreement expanded the scope of judicial review; (2) the arbitrator erred, as a matter of law, in ruling that NCS breached its contract with Prescott and that Prescott was entitled to damages; and (3) the arbitrator violated several provisions of the MUAA.8 Because we are uncertain whether, and if so, to what extent, the arbitration agreement expanded the scope of judicial review, we vacate the district court\\'s judgment and remand for further proceedings.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      In a broad sense, this dispute is subject to the FAA. See Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University, 489 U.S. 468, 478-79, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 1255-56, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1989)(finding that the FAA applies to \"a written agreement to arbitrate in any contract involving interstate commerce\"); 9 U.S.C. &#167; 2 (2000). Thus, the FAA, and the body of federal substantive law interpreting it, would typically govern the resolution of this dispute. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S. Ct. 927, 941, 74 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1983)(recognizing that the FAA \"create[s] a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the Act\").\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      The FAA, however, does not bar parties from structuring an arbitration by means of their contractual agreements, nor does it preempt all state laws regarding arbitration. See Harris, 286 F.3d at 793 (permitting contractual modification concerning standard of review); Specialty Healthcare Mgmt., Inc. v. St. Mary\\'s Parish Hosp., 220 F.3d 650, 654 (5th Cir.2000)(recognizing that the FAA \"does not preempt all state law related to arbitration agreements\"). We held in Gateway Technologies, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications Corp., 64 F.3d 993, 996 (5th Cir.1995), that \"a contractual modification is acceptable because, as the Supreme Court has emphasized, arbitration is a creature of contract and the FAA\\'s pro-arbitration policy does not operate without regard to the wishes of the contracting parties.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      A threshold issue is which state\\'s law governs the interpretation of the arbitration contract. Prescott\\'s employment agreement provided that the arbitration \"was subject to ... the Montana Arbitration Act, Title 27, Montana Code Annotated.\" The district court viewed this as a choice-of-law provision concerning the standards for arbitration. NCS contends, correctly, that the reference to the MUAA is not a choice-of-law provision, and that Louisiana law controls the interpretation of the arbitration agreement as an addendum to the employment contract. In Valero Refining, Inc. v. M\/T Lauberhorn, 813 F.2d 60, 64 n. 5 (5th Cir.1987), this circuit determined that contractual language authorizing arbitration in New York City did not constitute a New York choice-of-law provision. Instead, \"the provision merely requires that the procedures that the arbitrators use be in accordance with the laws applicable to New York City.\" Id. at 65 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the MUAA controls the procedures attendant to the arbitration, but not the interpretation of the underlying contract.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Louisiana law applies to this dispute between a Louisiana resident and a Louisiana school concerning the proper interpretation of a Louisiana contract.9 The employment contract contained a valid provision requiring all disputes to be adjudicated under the laws of Louisiana. In Louisiana, \"[w]here parties stipulate the State law governing the contract, Louisiana conflict of laws principles require that the stipulation be given effect, unless there is statutory or jurisprudential law to the contrary or strong public policy considerations justifying the refusal to honor the contract as written.\" Delhomme Industries, Inc. v. Houston Beechcraft, Inc., 669 F.2d 1049, 1058 (5th Cir.1982)(quoting Associated Press v. Toledo Invs., Inc., 389 So. 2d 752, 754 (La.App.1980)). The parties\\' additional pre-arbitration agreement in no way detracts from that choice; alternatively, it is independently subject to Louisiana law.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      The inquiry thus becomes whether the parties\\' arbitration agreement contemplated expanded judicial review. Contrary to the district court\\'s determination, this matter cannot be resolved on the face of the agreement and requires further factual development. Under Louisiana law, \"interpretation of a contract is the determination of the common intent of the parties.\" LA. CIV.CODE ANN. ART. 2045 (2003). However, \"[w]hen the words of a contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences, no further interpretation may be made in search of the parties\\' intent.\" LA. CIV.CODE ANN. ART. 2046 (2003). Only if the contract is ambiguous may the court look beyond the four corners of the document. Taita Chemical Co., Ltd. v. Westlake Styrene Corp., 246 F.3d 377, 386 (5th Cir.2001).\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      In a handwritten additional paragraph, NCS and Prescott agreed that \"[n]o party waives appeal rights, if any, by signing this [arbitration] agreement.\" The district court concluded that this language merely preserved whatever appeal rights the MUAA already granted to the parties. This conclusion is far from self-evident. In Gateway, the arbitration agreement provided that \"[t]he arbitration decision shall be final and binding to both parties, except that errors of law shall be subject to appeal.\" 64 F.3d at 996. The court concluded that this language \"expanded review of the arbitration award by the federal courts.\" Id. This court reached the same result in Harris, where the agreement provided that \"[t]he Award of the Arbitrator shall be binding on the parties hereto, although each party shall retain his right to appeal any questions of law, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction.\" 286 F.3d at 793. While the language in Harris and Gateway is more straightforward, it can certainly be argued that by adding this language to a form contract that otherwise contained no provision concerning appeal of an arbitration award, the parties here intended to expand the scope of judicial review. Such an interpretation heeds the principle that \"[a] provision susceptible of different meanings must be interpreted with the meaning that renders it effective and not one that renders it ineffective.\" LA. CIV.CODE ART. 2049 (2003). The district court\\'s interpretation would seem to render the handwritten modification surplusage, and therefore meaningless.10\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      Even if the parties intended to affect the scope of judicial review with this language, however, their precise intentions concerning expanded review are ambiguous. We reach this conclusion mindful that \"[e]ach provision in a contract must be interpreted in light of the other provisions so that each is given the meaning suggested by the contract as a whole.\" LA. CIV.CODE ART. 2050. Thus, it is also significant that the parties decided to permit \"a court of law\" to review written and oral communications (i.e., the record evidence) from the arbitration; this modification of the contract\\'s form language amplifies their apparent intent to expand the scope of judicial review. Reinforcing Prescott\\'s apparent intention to preserve expanded appeal rights (it was her attorney who insisted upon these special conditions), Prescott had a court reporter transcribe the arbitration proceedings.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      These contractual tidbits strongly suggest that the parties intended judicial review to be available beyond the normal narrow range of the FAA or MUAA. Because they cannot compel a firm decision on the face of the contract, however, we find it ambiguous and must remand for the district court to take evidence on and contractually interpret the circumstances surrounding the making of the provision. The court will then be required to re-evaluate under the appropriate standard NCS\\'s challenges to the arbitration award.\\n    \\n    IV. CONCLUSION\\n    \\n      19\\n      For the reasons stated above, we VACATE the district court\\'s order confirming the arbitration award and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      VACATED and REMANDED.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        Notes:\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         On the eve of arbitration, Prescott voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims against the individual defendants. Thus, only NCS and Prescott remain parties to this litigation\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         Curiously, the arbitrator employed the biblical passages that were cited as prefatory principles in the contract in order tosupersede the actual contract language, which gave Prescott no right to be employed beyond a one-year term. This result appears incompatible with Louisiana law. See Barbe v. A.A. Harmon &amp; Co., 705 So. 2d 1210 (1998).\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         The arbitrator rejected Prescott\\'s Title VII claims, as well as her claim under the Louisiana Whistleblower Protection Act. Prescott did not appeal the rejection of these claims to the district court\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         NCS also filed other post-arbitration motions with the arbitrator. NCS filed an objection to ex parte communications, a motion for a new hearing, and a motion for disclosure contending that new evidence had been uncovered that demanded a hearing. The arbitrator summarily denied these motions on July 31, 2002\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         Under the FAA, a district court may vacate an award only if: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means; (2) there is evidence of partiality or corruption among the arbitrators; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct which prejudiced the rights of one of the parties; or (4) the arbitrators exceeded their powers. 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(2001);Harris, 286 F.3d at 791. An arbitration award may also be vacated if in making the award the arbitrator acted with \"manifest disregard for the law.\" Williams v. Cigna Fin. Advisors, Inc., 197 F.3d 752, 761 (5th Cir.1999).\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         Under MUAA, a court may only vacate an arbitration award if:\\n        (a) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means; (b) there was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral or corruption in any of the arbitrators or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party; (c) the arbitrators exceeded their powers; (d) the arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor or refused to hear evidence material to the controversy or otherwise so conducted the hearing, contrary to the provisions of 27-5-213, as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party; or (e) there was no arbitration agreement and the issue was not adversely determined in proceedings under 27-5-115 and the party did not participate in the arbitration hearing without raising the objection.\\n        MONT.CODE. &#167; 27-5-312(1)(2003).\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         An arbitration award may be modified or corrected, under the MUAA, only if:\\n        (a) there was an evident miscalculation of figures or mistake in the description of any person, thing, or property referred to in the award; (b) the arbitrators awarded upon a matter not submitted to him and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the issues submitted; or (c) the award is imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy.\\n        MONT.CODE &#167; 27-5-313(1)(2003).\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         More specifically, NCS argued, in addition to the scope of review issue, that the arbitrator erred in: (1) finding that NCS breached its contract with Prescott; (2) awarding damages that were unauthorized under Louisiana law; (3) exceeding his contractually limited authority; and (4) engaging in misconduct by participating in ex parte communications with Prescott\\'s counsel, neglecting material evidence, and refusing to disclose circumstances likely to affect impartiality. The district court found against NCS on all grounds, and NCS has appealed each assignment of error to this court\\n      \\n      \\n        9\\n         See Coghlan v. Wellcraft Marine Corp. 240 F.3d 449, 452 (5th Cir.2001) (federal court must apply choice-of-law rules of state in which it sits); Godchaux v. Conveying Techniques, Inc., 846 F.2d 306, (5th Cir.1988) (\"Louisiana provides that the law of the place of contracting determines the nature, validity, and construction of that contract.\") (citations omitted).\\n      \\n      \\n        10\\n         Furthermore, the instant case is materially distinct fromAction Indus., Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 358 F.3d 337 (5th Cir.2004). There, the court determined \"that the parties\\' intent to replace the FAA\\'s vacatur standard [could] not be gleaned from the Agreement\\'s general choice-of-law provision, which provide[d] that Tennessee law govern[ed] contractual execution and performance.\" Id. at 341. Thus, the arbitration clause did \"not in any way modify or replace the FAA\\'s rules.\" Id. However, in the instant case, the contractual modification is not premised on a general choice-of-law provision or a vague reference to a particular state\\'s arbitration statute. Rather, the parties expressly adopted the ICC arbitration agreement and amended that agreement by inserting tailor-made appellate review language. Thus, the provision at issue is fundamentally different than the provision struck in Action Industries and more closely resembles the provisions approved of in Gateway and Harris. Last, as Action Industries recognizes, \"we construe ambiguous contractual language against the party who drafted it.\" Id. (citing Ford v. NYLCare Health Plans of the Gulf Coast, Inc., 141 F.3d 243, 249 (5th Cir.1998)). Therefore, we must construe the provision, and any ambiguities contained therein, against Prescott.\\n      \\n    \\n    CARL E. STEWART, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\\n    \\n      21\\n      I respectfully dissent from the panel majority\\'s conclusion that a clause that provides \"No party waives appeal rights, if any, by signing this [arbitration] agreement,\" when considered on its face or when read in harmony with the other provisions of the parties\\' agreement, is ambiguous regarding the parties\\' intent to contract for a more expansive scope of review than that otherwise available pursuant to the FAA or the MUAA. The majority accurately sets forth the facts and procedural history of this case, so I will not repeat them here.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      The majority concludes that this clause, which speaks only in terms of \"appeal rights\" and contemplates that none may exist, at least arguably evidences the parties\\' intent \"to expand the scope of judicial review.\" The majority reaches this conclusion even though the clause neither identifies a question for our consideration that would not otherwise be reviewable under the FAA or MUAA nor refers to any particular level of scrutiny pursuant to which such review should be conducted. The majority further finds that certain \"contractual tidbits ... strongly suggest that the parties intended judicial review to be available beyond the normal narrow range of the FAA or MUAA.\" Finally, notwithstanding its uncertainty regarding whether and to what extent the parties\\' agreement expanded the scope of judicial review, the majority concludes that this ambiguity requires that we remand the case to the district court to adduce evidence of the parties\\' intentions and \"interpret the circumstances surrounding the making of this provision.\" Because I find the majority\\'s determinations irreconcilable with the terms, context, and purpose of the parties\\' arbitration agreement and our recent clarification in Action Industries, Inc. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 358 F.3d 337 (5th Cir.2004), regarding the level of exactitude required to opt-out of the narrow scope of review available under the governing arbitration statute, I must disagree with all three conclusions.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      The majority begins its analysis by rejecting the district court\\'s determination that the reference to the Montana Uniform Arbitration Act contained in the parties\\' submission agreement constituted a \"choice-of-law\" provision governing the scope of judicial review of the arbitration award in the instant case. This provision provided that \"THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE MONTANA ARBITRATION ACT, TITLE 27, MONTANA CODE ANNOTATED.\" The district court reasoned that the MUAA, like the FAA, sets forth only limited grounds for vacatur or modification of an arbitration award, and that to \"expand the scope of judicial review beyond that allowed by the law governing the arbitration process, the arbitration agreement must expressly and unambiguously evidence the parties\\' intent to do so.\" Finding no such express and unambiguous statement in the submission agreement\\'s additional, handwritten provision that \"No party waives appeal rights, if any, by signing this [arbitration] agreement,\" the district court concluded that the clause simply retained the few grounds for disturbing an arbitration award available under the MUAA.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      According to the majority, our opinion in Valero Refining, 813 F.2d at 64-65 &amp; n. 5, compels the conclusion that the MUAA clause \"controls the procedures attendant to the arbitration, but not the interpretation of the underlying contract.\" The latter question, the majority reasons, must be determined under Louisiana law, in accordance with the general choice-of-law provision contained in the parties\\' employment agreement. While I agree that we must resort to state rules of construction to resolve any conflict between purportedly competing contractual provisions, the majority\\'s reliance on Valero Refining is misplaced, and injects ambiguity into an agreement which, when properly considered as a whole, has none. And, even if I were to agree that the parties\\' intention regarding the applicable scope of judicial review is ambiguous, our opinion in Action Industries, Inc., 358 F.3d at 341-42, establishing that a clause must be clear and unambiguous to expand the statutory scope of review, makes it patently apparent that the clause at issue here fails to overcome the governing arbitration statute and its attendant narrow grounds for vacatur. I will address each of these points in turn.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      In Valero Refining, we rejected the assertion that a clause stipulating that the \"laws of the City of New York\" would govern the arbitration proceeding1 invoked the then-controlling law of the Second Circuit, of which New York is a part, that RICO claims were not subject to arbitration. Id. at 65. We reasoned that the agreement\\'s reference to New York law was not a choice-of-law clause requiring application of the Second Circuit\\'s rule regarding arbitrability, but rather \"merely require[d] that the procedures that the arbitrators use be in accordance with the laws applicable to New York City.\" Id. (emphasis added). The clause at issue in Valero Refining, however, is not comparable to the specific reference to the MUAA in the submission agreement before us. In Ford v. NYLCare Health Plans of the Gulf Coast Inc., 141 F.3d 243 (5th Cir.1998), relied upon by the district court, we held that a virtually identical reference to state law &#8212; in that case, to the Texas General Arbitration Act2 &#8212; unambiguously governed nothing less than every aspect of the arbitration under the agreement at issue, rejecting the assertion that the clause could be read to make the \"TGAA applicable only to the procedural aspects of arbitration.\" Id. at 249 (concluding that the reference to the TGAA unambiguously expressed the parties\\' intent to supercede the FAA rules with Texas arbitration law).\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      It is clear under Ford that the MUAA clause sufficed to supercede the FAA\\'s scope of review, and at least provisionally set forth the grounds for vacatur or modification of the arbitration award in the instant case. See id.; Action Industries, 358 F.3d at 342-43 (recognizing that an agreement\\'s specific reference to a state arbitration statute would suffice to opt-out of the FAA standards for vacatur). The question thus becomes whether other language in the parties\\' agreement sufficed to overcome the MUAA clause. See Ford, 141 F.3d at 249. In this case the parties\\' rights and duties with respect to arbitration are set forth in two separate agreements: the employment contract, which contains an arbitration clause and incorporates the ICC\\'s arbitration rules by reference, and a submission agreement, which supplements the parties\\' more general commitment to resolve their disputes through arbitration by defining the issues to be submitted to the arbitrator.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      Like the MUAA clause, the clause at the core of this dispute, \"No party waives appeal rights, if any, by signing this agreement,\" appears in the submission agreement. On its face, this \"no waiver\" clause indicates that the parties intended only to retain whatever appeal rights they had at the time they added that clause. The majority, rejecting this view as \"not self-evident,\" finds that NCS\\'s argument that such an interpretation renders the \"no waiver\" clause surplusage is sufficiently compelling to create an ambiguity in the parties\\' agreement. The majority is further persuaded by the purported absence of any other \"provision concerning an appeal of an award\" in the parties\\' agreement. I disagree with both aspects of the majority\\'s rationale and its ultimate conclusion that such an ambiguity exists.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      First, the majority\\'s reading &#8212; that the clause does not simply retain the MUAA standards &#8212; renders the language \"if any\" surplusage, and it is the very inclusion of the phrase \"if any\" that evidences the parties\\' express contemplation that the entire clause may be redundant. As the majority acknowledges, under Louisiana law, an interpretation of a contract that has the effect of rendering a provision superfluous or meaningless must be avoided. See LA. CIV.CODE ART. 2049. Thus, we cannot, as the majority has done, leave out terms of a contract or render them surplusage and then declare that there is an ambiguity, itself a result of refusing to give effect to the contract\\'s express provisions.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      Second, contrary to the majority\\'s conclusion, the arbitration agreement at issue contains numerous provisions concerning \"appeal rights,\" all of which reaffirm the parties\\' intent that any arbitration award would be final and binding and not subject to appeal \"except as provided by law.\" In particular, the parties\\' employment agreement provided that the parties \"waive their respective rights to file a lawsuit against one another in any civil courts for such disputes, except to enforce a legally binding arbitration decision.\" (emphasis added). The employment agreement also incorporated by reference the ICC rules, which in turn provided that \"[t]he arbitrator\\'s decision is final\" and \"shall be legally binding on the parties, except as provided by law,\" and, more specifically, \"cannot be considered or appealed except as provided by Rule 41 (Request for Reconsideration [by the arbitrator]) and\/or civil law.\" ICC Rules 40.E, G. Clause 2 of the submission agreement similarly provided that the arbitration would be \"legally binding.\" In Clause 3, the submission agreement reiterated that the parties \"agreed to `abide by and perform any decision rendered by the arbitrator\\'\" and that the parties \"realize that arbitration will be the exclusive remedy for this dispute and that [they] may not later litigate these matters in civil court.\" In short, these provisions establish the agreement\\'s primary emphasis on the exclusivity and finality of arbitration as a means of resolving the instant dispute between the parties. All of these provisions support the conclusion that the parties\\' handwritten \"no waiver\" clause merely sought to preserve whatever narrow grounds for challenging an arbitration award that were available to them.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      Nor do the aptly-labeled \"contractual tidbits\" cited by the majority compel the contrary conclusion that the parties\\' added language intended to expand the scope of judicial review. That the parties\\' agreement authorized \"a court of law\" to review written and oral communications might, as the majority concludes, support the notion that they contemplated an expanded review. However, it is also wholly consistent with an intent to allow consideration of the arbitration award only under the narrow grounds available under the FAA, or, in this case, the MUAA, which, for example, permit vacatur where an arbitrator\\'s failure to consider relevant evidence has substantially prejudiced a party. See 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(3); MONT.CODE &#167; 27-5-312(1)(d). In the absence of record evidence, or the authorization to review written and oral communications, the reviewing court would encounter great difficulty in assessing an alleged error by the arbitrator based on this ground.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      Similarly, Prescott\\'s insistence that the arbitral proceedings be transcribed do not persuade me to lean in favor of finding an intent to expand the scope of judicial review. The application of a narrow scope of review (limiting the grounds open for our consideration) or a deferential standard of review (setting forth how hard we must look at such grounds) does not obviate the need for a record. See, e.g., Prestige Ford v. Ford Dealer Computer Servs., Inc., 324 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir.2003) (stating that, \"[g]iven the limited record available to this court, absent further documentation in the record suggesting a willful inattentiveness to the governing law, it would be difficult to find that the arbitration panel acted with manifest disregard for an applicable legal principle without undermining our stated deference for the arbitration process\"). In fact, the ICC Rules pursuant to which the parties\\' arbitration was conducted specifically allow such transcription, yet, as noted above, also expressly state that any resultant award \"shall be legally binding on the parties\" and \"cannot be considered or appealed except as provided by Rule 41 (Request for Reconsideration [by the arbitrator]) and\/or civil law.\" ICC Rules 40.E, G. Admittedly, the grounds available for disturbing an arbitration award pursuant to the FAA or MUAA are narrow; however, when they apply they do not provide for no review at all.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      Finally, even if I were to agree with the majority that the \"no waiver\" clause at issue is ambiguous regarding the parties\\' intent to expand judicial review, the very existence of ambiguity means that at best this clause may be deemed a failed attempt to alter the scope of review otherwise available under the MUAA. Our recent decision in Action Industries, 358 F.3d at 340-41, confirms the district court\\'s rationale that the contractual language required to opt-out of the governing statutory scope of review must be \"clear and unambiguous.\" See id. at 341-42 (citing Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52, 59, 115 S. Ct. 1212, 131 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1995); Hughes Training Inc. v. Cook, 254 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2001)). In Action Industries, we rejected the assertion that a general choice-of-law provision referencing Tennessee law, without reference to the Tennessee Uniform Arbitration Act, was insufficiently clear and unambiguous to evidence the parties\\' intent to opt-out of the FAA\\'s grounds for vacatur of an arbitration award. Id. at 342. Notwithstanding the appellant\\'s argument that this intent could be \"gleaned\" from this choice-of-law provision, we did not remand the matter to the district court to adduce further evidence regarding the parties\\' intent. Rather, once we determined that the parties\\' agreement did not specifically reference state arbitration law or specify, \"with certain exactitude how the FAA [vacatur] rules [were] to be modified,\" we simply concluded that it failed as a matter of law to depart from the governing standard.\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      As examples of clauses that met the requisite level of exactitude, the Action Industries panel pointed to the clauses in Gateway, 64 F.3d at 996, and Harris, 286 F.3d at 793, noting that in each case we held that the language employed \"evinced the parties\\' clear intent to depart from the FAA\\'s vacatur standard.\" Action Industries, 358 F.3d at 342. Although the majority concedes that the \"no waiver\" clause at issue in this case is not \"as straightforward\" as the clauses we considered in Gateway and Harris, I cannot agree, in light of our opinion in Action Industries, that the lack of specificity in the \"no waiver\" clause can lead us to conclude anything other than it does not suffice to expand the scope of judicial review beyond the grounds available under the MUAA. Moreover, a close reading of Harris reveals that the opinion presciently recognized that to the extent a clause neither identifies with specificity a question for our consideration not otherwise available under the governing statutory standard nor refers to any particular level of scrutiny pursuant to which such review should be conducted, that clause will not successfully expand the scope of review.\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      In Harris, we refined Gateway\\'s holding by establishing that an agreement that merely reserves the \"right to appeal any questions of law,\" does not necessarily mean that de novo review applies to all issues on appeal. See Harris, 286 F.3d at 793-94. At issue in Harris was the intended meaning of the phrase \"questions of law.\" Id. The Harris panel found that the phrase was equally susceptible to two reasonable and conflicting interpretations, noting that it \"could reasonably be interpreted to encompass solely `pure\\' questions of law, [as the appellee argued,] or it could be read broadly, to encompass mixed questions of law and fact,\" as urged by the drafter-appellants. Id. at 793-94. Consequently, the Harris panel concluded that the reference to \"questions of law\" was ambiguous, and construed the phrase against the drafter-appellants.3 Id. at 794. Significantly, the panel concluded that this not only dictated that de novo review apply only to pure questions of law, but that, \"with respect to questions of fact and mixed questions of law and fact, we apply the default standard of review, vacating only for manifest disregard of the law, or on the grounds listed in the FAA.\" Id. (emphasis added).\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      We also found that the canon of contract construction requiring courts to \"give effect to all contract provisions so that none will be rendered meaningless\" compelled our narrow interpretation of the clause. Id. We noted in Harris that because the arbitrator\\'s legal conclusions \"were intimately bound up with the facts,\" none of his findings would be final if we were to review de novo all mixed questions of fact and law. Id. Thus, we reasoned, a broad reading of \"questions of law\" to encompass mixed questions would render meaningless \"the provision that the arbitrator\\'s award should be binding.\" Id. Accordingly, we concluded that \"questions of law\" had to be construed as referring to only \"pure\" legal questions in order to give effect to this finality provision. We further pointed out that parties seeking \"more extensive review of an arbitrator\\'s award may do so by specifying the standard of review in the arbitration agreement.\" Id. (citing Hughes Training, 254 F.3d at 593 (enforcing a provision that stated that \"in actions seeking to vacate an [arbitration] award, the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator\\'s findings of fact and conclusions of law will be the same as that applied by an appellate court reviewing a decision of a trial court sitting without a jury\")). The Harris panel noted that unlike in Hughes, \"[i]n the present case, the arbitration agreement simply did not specify that the standard of review for anything other than pure questions of law had been altered.\" Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      In light of our circuit precedent as clarified in Harris and Action Industries, I cannot agree with the majority\\'s view that a clause which, by the majority\\'s own admission is at best ambiguous regarding the parties\\' intent to expand judicial review, requires remanding the matter for further inquiry into the circumstances surrounding its drafting. In Harris and Action Industries, we did not remand the matter for the district court to take evidence on the parties\\' intent; rather, we established that the applicable statutory standard would govern to the extent of the deficiency in specificity. See Harris, 286 F.3d at 794; Action Industries, 358 F.3d at 342. Because I find that by its terms, purpose, and context, the \"no waiver\" clause does not unambiguously expand the scope of judicial review and that a contrary interpretation would render other provisions pertaining to the finality of the award meaningless, I would affirm the district court\\'s confirmation of the arbitration award. As the majority concedes, a remand would eviscerate whatever vestiges of efficient dispute resolution still exist in this case, an eventuality that is wholly inconsistent with the parties\\' undisputed intent to resolve their claims exclusively through arbitration. The parties have already asserted their respective conflicting interpretations to the district court and this court, and I am unpersuaded that they will shed any greater light on their respective positions should they find themselves before the district court for a reprise. I further note that it is inevitable that one side in an arbitration would be dissatisfied with the result. Absent clear and unambiguous contractual language to the contrary, however, I find that the scope of our review is limited to consideration of the narrow grounds for vacatur or modification of the award that exist at law. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        Notes:\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         The clause at issue provided: \"Any and all differences and disputes of whatsoever nature arising out of this Charter shall be put to arbitration in the City of New York pursuant to the laws relating to arbitration there in force.\"Valero Refining, 813 F.2d at 64 n. 5.\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         The arbitration agreement stated that arbitration of any claim must be settled \"in accordance with the Texas General Arbitration Act\" and, as in this case, contained a notice providing: \"THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THE TEXAS GENERAL ARBITRATION ACT.\"Ford, 141 F.3d at 249.\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         UnlikeHarris, however, in the instant case the parties\\' employment contract provided that \"This contract shall be interpreted under ... Louisiana [law] as if jointly authored by the parties,\" rendering it inappropriate to construe the added \"no waiver\" language against the drafter of that clause. (emphasis added). Of course, we only resort to this principle of contractual interpretation where the contested language is ambiguous and, as I have discussed above, I do not agree that any such ambiguity surrounds the \"no waiver\" clause at issue in this case.\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 35241}, {'author_str': 'Jones', 'per_curiam': False, 'type': '020lead', 'page_count': None, 'download_url': None, 'author_id': None, 'opinion_text': '\\nEDITH H. JONES, Circuit Judge:\\nNorthlake Christian School (NCS) attempted to forestall strife with its newly-hired principal Pamela Prescott by entering into an employment contract for \u201cbib-lically-based mediation\u201d or arbitration under the auspices of the Institute for Christian Conciliation, these methods being prescribed as the \u201csole remedy\u201d for any controversy. When the school\u2019s relationship with Prescott deteriorated, however, Prescott filed suit. The district court ordered ADR. Mediation occurred, then arbitration; NCS appealed a highly adverse and somewhat dubious award back to the court; NCS appealed to this court; and we are forced to remand for further proceedings. So much for saving money and relationships through alternative dispute resolution. Perfect justice is not always found in this world.\\nI. BACKGROUND\\nNCS hired Prescott as its elementary\/preschool principal for the 1999-2000 school year. In a written employment contract, the parties agreed \u201cin conformity with the biblical injunctions of 1 Corinthians 6:1-8, Matthew 5:23,24, and Matthew 18:15-20 ... that any claim or dispute arising out of, or related to, this agreement or to any aspect of the employment relationship\u201d would be referred to \u201cbiblically-based mediation\u201d and, if unsuccessful, binding arbitration. The agreement specified that \u201cthe arbitration process shall be conducted in accordance with the current Rules of Procedure for Christian Conciliation of the Institute for Christian Conciliation.\u201d Moreover, the parties waived \u201ctheir respective rights to file a lawsuit against one another in any civil court for such disputes, except to enforce a legally binding arbitration decision.\u201d\\nIn the spring of 2000, NCS told Prescott her contract would not be renewed for the following year and instructed her to vacate the premises of the school by March 31, 2000. She was placed on administrative leave for the duration of the school year contract and was paid her full salary and benefits throughout the contract term.\\nIn February 2001, Prescott filed suit against NCS, its board of directors, and its chief administrator in federal court. She asserted claims for Title VII gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation, violation of the Louisiana Whistle-blower Protection Act, La. R.S. \u00a7 23:967 (2003), and breach of contract. NCS moved to compel arbitration. The court granted NCS\u2019s motion, stayed Prescott\u2019s suit, and administratively closed the case.1\\nTo submit their dispute to arbitration, following the failure of mediation, the parties executed a form mediation\/arbitration agreement furnished by the ICC. They agreed to be governed by ICC rules, which included conducting the arbitration pursuant to the Montana Uniform Arbitration Act (\u201cMUAA\u201d). Most important, the parties interlineated the agreement in two places. First, the agreement originally provided that all communications, written or oral, \u201cbetween the parties during the mediation and\/or arbitration process *494shall be inadmissible in a court of law or for legal discovery.\u201d The parties crossed out the \u201cand\/or arbitration\u201d language, presumably making such communications admissible in a court of law. Second, on Prescott\u2019s initiative, the parties added and initialed a hand-written provision, which stated: \u201cNo party waives appeal rights, if any, by signing this agreement.\u201d\\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt at mediation, the parties proceeded before a single ICC arbitrator. Over a six-day period, the arbitrator heard testimony from a multitude of witnesses and reviewed the evidence and affidavits submitted by the parties. On June 14, 2002, the arbitrator determined that NCS had failed to resolve its conflict with Prescott in accordance with Matthew 18, and other biblical scriptures, which he held were incorporated into the terms of Prescott\u2019s employment contract.2 The arbitrator rendered judgment in favor of Prescott on her breach of contract claim and awarded her $157,856.52 for damage to her reputation and for future loss of income.3 The arbitrator also awarded NCS $786.46 for past due COBRA payments. NCS filed a motion to reconsider with the ICC administrator.4 The arbitrator denied the motion.\\nNCS next moved to vacate the arbitration award in federal court, and argued, inter alia, that the handwritten amendments to the arbitration agreement expanded the federal court\u2019s scope of review. Under this expanded scope of review, NCS urged the district court to vacate the arbitration award, as a matter of law, because Prescott was not wrongfully terminated, and she was not entitled to damages. The district court disagreed and concluded that the \u201cif any\u201d language \u201cmerely preserves whatever appeal rights are statutorily granted under the MUAA.\u201d The district court rejected NCS\u2019s substantive claims under the MUAA\u2019s narrow scope of review. NCS now appeals that decision to this court.\\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\\nOn a motion to vacate an arbitration award, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. Harris v. Parker College of Chiropractic, 286 F.3d 790, 791 (5th Cir.2002). Normally, the district court\u2019s review of an arbitration award, under the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), is \u201cextraordinarily narrow.\u201d Antwine v. Prudential Bache Securities, Inc., 899 F.2d 410, 413 (5th Cir.1990)(stating that, under the FAA, \u201ccourts should defer to the arbitrator\u2019s decision when possible\u201d) (citations omitted).5 The scope of judicial re*495view is equally narrow under the MUAA.6 The MUAA also permits modification of an arbitration award under limited circumstances.7\\nIn the instant case, we are called upon to determine whether the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement expanded the scope of judicial review beyond that provided in the MUAA. The district court\u2019s interpretation of a contract, including the initial determination whether the contract is ambiguous, is a conclusion of law. American Totalisator Co., Inc. v. Fair Grounds Corp., 3 F.3d 810, 813 (5th Cir.1993); Thrift v. Hubbard, 44 F.3d 348, 357 (5th Cir.1995). If the contract is ambiguous, then \u201cthe determination of the parties\u2019 intent through the extrinsic evidence is a question of fact.\u201d Watkins v. PetroSearch, Inc., 689 F.2d 537, 538 (5th Cir.1982).\\nIII. DISCUSSION\\nNCS offers several arguments on appeal: (1) the arbitration agreement expanded the scope of judicial review; (2) the arbitrator erred, as a matter of law, in ruling that NCS breached its contract with Prescott and that Prescott was entitled to damages; and (3) the arbitrator violated several provisions of the MUAA.8 Because we are uncertain whether, and if so, to what extent, the arbitration agreement expanded the scope of judicial review, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings.\\nIn a broad sense, this dispute is subject to the FAA. See Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University, 489 U.S. 468, 478-79, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 1255-56, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989)(finding that the FAA applies to \u201ca written agreement to arbitrate in any contract involving interstate commerce\u201d); 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (2000). Thus, the FAA, and *496the body of federal substantive law interpreting it, would typically govern the resolution of this dispute. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S.Ct. 927, 941, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983)(reeognizing that the FAA \u201ccreate[s] a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the Act\u201d).\\nThe FAA, however, does not bar parties from structuring an arbitration by means of their contractual agreements, nor does it preempt all state laws regarding arbitration. See Harris, 286 F.3d at 793 (permitting contractual modification concerning standard of review); Specialty Healthcare Mgmt., Inc. v. St. Mary\u2019s Parish Hosp., 220 F.3d 650, 654 (5th Cir.2000)(recognizing that the FAA \u201cdoes not preempt all state law related to arbitration agreements\u201d). We held in Gateway Technologies, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications Corp., 64 F.3d 993, 996 (5th Cir.1995), that \u201ca contractual modification is acceptable because, as the Supreme Court has emphasized, arbitration is a creature of contract and the FAA\u2019s pro-arbitration policy does not operate without regard to the wishes of the contracting parties.\u201d\\nA threshold issue is which state\u2019s law governs the interpretation of the arbitration contract. Prescott\u2019s employment agreement provided that the arbitration \u201cwas subject to ... the Montana Arbitration Act, Title 27, Montana Code Annotated.\u201d The district court viewed this as a choice-of-law provision concerning the standards for arbitration. NCS contends, correctly, that the reference to the MUAA is not a choice-of-law provision, and that Louisiana law controls the interpretation of the arbitration agreement as an addendum to the employment contract. In Valero Refining, Inc. v. M\/T Lauberhorn, 813 F.2d 60, 64 n. 5 (5th Cir.1987), this circuit determined that contractual language authorizing arbitration in New York City did not constitute a New York choice-of-law provision. Instead, \u201cthe provision merely requires that the procedures that the arbitrators use be in accordance with the laws applicable to New York City.\u201d Id. at 65 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the MUAA controls the procedures attendant to the arbitration, but not the interpretation of the underlying contract.\\nLouisiana law applies to this dispute between a Louisiana resident and a Louisiana school concerning the proper interpretation of a Louisiana contract.9 The employment contract contained a valid provision requiring all disputes to be adjudicated under the laws of Louisiana. In Louisiana, \u201c[wjhere parties stipulate the State law governing the contract, Louisiana conflict of laws principles require that the stipulation be given effect, unless there is statutory or jurisprudential law to the contrary or strong public policy considerations justifying the refusal to honor the contract as written.\u201d Delhomme Industries, Inc. v. Houston Beechcraft, Inc., 669 F.2d 1049, 1058 (5th Cir.1982)(quoting Associated Press v. Toledo Invs., Inc., 389 So.2d 752, 754 (La.App.1980)). The parties\u2019 additional pre-arbitration agreement in no way detracts from that choice; alternatively, it is independently subject to Louisiana law.\\n*497The inquiry thus becomes whether the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement contemplated expanded judicial review. Contrary to the district court\u2019s determination, this matter cannot be resolved on the face of the agreement and requires further factual development. Under Louisiana law, \u201cinterpretation of a contract is the determination of the common intent of the parties.\u201d La. Civ.Code Ann. ART. 2045 (2003). However, \u201c[w]hen the words of a contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences, no further interpretation may be made in search of the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d La. Civ.Code Ann. aet. 2046 (2003). Only if the contract is ambiguous may the court look beyond the four corners of the document. Taita Chemical Co., Ltd. v. Westlake Styrene Corp., 246 F.3d 377, 386 (5th Cir.2001).\\nIn a handwritten additional paragraph, NCS and Prescott agreed that \u201c[n]o party waives appeal rights, if any, by signing this [arbitration] agreement.\u201d The district court concluded that this language merely preserved whatever appeal rights the MUAA already granted to the parties. This conclusion is far from self-evident. In Gateway, the arbitration agreement provided that \u201c[t]he arbitration decision shall be final and binding to both parties, except that errors of law shall be subject to appeal.\u201d 64 F.3d at 996. The court concluded that this language \u201cexpanded review of the arbitration award by the federal courts.\u201d Id. This court reached the same result in Harris, where the agreement provided that \u201c[t]he Award of the Arbitrator shall be binding on the parties hereto, although each party shall retain his right to appeal any questions of law, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction.\u201d 286 F.3d at 793. While the language in Harris and Gateway is more straightforward, it can certainly be argued that by adding this language to a form contract that otherwise contained no provision concerning appeal of an arbitration award, the parties here intended to expand the scope of judicial review. Such an interpretation heeds the principle that \u201c[a] provision susceptible of different meanings must be interpreted with the meaning that renders it effective and not one that renders it ineffective.\u201d La. Civ.Code abt. 2049 (2003). The district court\u2019s interpretation would seem to render the handwritten modification surplus-age, and therefore meaningless.10\\nEven if the parties intended to affect the scope of judicial review with this language, however, their precise intentions concerning expanded review are ambiguous. We reach this conclusion mindful that \u201c[e]ach provision in a contract must be interpreted *498in light of the other provisions so that each is given the meaning suggested by the contract as a whole.\u201d La. Civ.Code Abt. 2050. Thus, it is also significant that the parties decided to permit \u201ca court of law\u201d to review written and oral communications (i.e., the record evidence) from the arbitration; this modification of the contract\u2019s form language amplifies their apparent intent to expand the scope of judicial review. Reinforcing Prescott\u2019s apparent intention to preserve expanded appeal rights (it was her attorney who insisted upon these special conditions), Prescott had a court reporter transcribe the arbitration proceedings.\\nThese contractual tidbits strongly suggest that the parties intended judicial review to be available beyond the normal narrow range of the FAA or MUAA. Because they cannot compel a firm decision on the face of the contract, however, we find it ambiguous and must remand for the district court to take evidence on and contractually interpret the circumstances surrounding the making of the provision. The court will then be required to reevaluate under the appropriate standard NCS\u2019s challenges to the arbitration award.\\nIV. CONCLUSION\\nFor the reasons stated above, we VACATE the district court\u2019s order confirming the arbitration award and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\nVACATED and REMANDED.\\n\\n. On the eve of arbitration, Prescott voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims against the individual defendants. Thus, only NCS and Prescott remain parties to this litigation.\\n\\n\\n. Curiously, the arbitrator employed the biblical passages that were cited as prefatory principles in the contract in order to supersede the actual contract language, which gave Prescott no right to be employed beyond a one-year term. This result appears incompatible with Louisiana law. See Barbe v. A.A. Harmon &amp; Co., 705 So.2d 1210 (1998).\\n\\n\\n. The arbitrator rejected Prescott\u2019s Title VII claims, as well as her claim under the Louisiana Whistleblower Protection Act. Prescott did not appeal the rejection of these claims to the district court.\\n\\n\\n. NCS also filed other post-arbitration motions with the arbitrator. NCS filed an objection to ex parte communications, a motion for a new hearing, and a motion for disclosure contending that new evidence had been uncovered that demanded a hearing. The arbitrator summarily denied these motions on July 31, 2002.\\n\\n\\n. Under the FAA, a district court may vacate an award only if: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means; (2) there is evidence of partiality or corruption among the arbitrators; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct which prejudiced the rights of one of the parties; or (4) the arbitrators exceeded their powers. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(2001); Harris, 286 F.3d at 791. An *495arbitration award may also be vacated if in making the award the arbitrator acted with \"manifest disregard for the law.\u201d Williams v. Cigna Fin. Advisors, Inc., 197 F.3d 752, 761 (5th Cir.1999).\\n\\n\\n. Under MUAA, a court may only vacate an arbitration award if:\\n(a) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means; (b) there was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral or corruption in any of the arbitrators or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party; (c) the arbitrators exceeded their powers; (d) the arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor or refused to hear evidence material to the controversy or otherwise so conducted the hearing, contrary to the provisions of 27-5-213, as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party; or (e) there was no arbitration agreement and the issue was not adversely determined in proceedings under 27-5-115 and the party did not participate in the arbitration hearing without raising the objection.\\nMont.Code. \u00a7 27-5-312(l)(2003).\\n\\n\\n. An arbitration award may be modified or corrected, under the MUAA, only if:\\n(a) there was an evident miscalculation of figures or mistake in the description of any person, thing, or property referred to in the award; (b) the arbitrators awarded upon a matter not submitted to him and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the issues submitted; or (c) the award is imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy.\\nMontCode \u00a7 27-5-313(l)(2003).\\n\\n\\n. More specifically, NCS argued, in addition to the scope of review issue, that the arbitrator erred in: (1) finding that NCS breached its contract with Prescott; (2) awarding damages that were unauthorized under Louisiana law; (3) exceeding his contractually limited authority; and (4) engaging in misconduct by participating in ex parte communications with Prescott\\'s counsel, neglecting material evidence, and refusing to disclose circumstances likely to affect impartiality. The district court found against NCS on all grounds, and NCS has appealed each assignment of error to this court.\\n\\n\\n. See Coghlan v. Wellcraft Marine Corp. 240 F.3d 449, 452 (5th Cir.2001) (federal court must apply choice-of-law rules of state in which it sits); Godchaux v. Conveying Techniques, Inc., 846 F.2d 306, (5th Cir.1988) (\"Louisiana provides that the law of the place of contracting determines the nature, validity, and construction of that contract.\u201d) (citations omitted).\\n\\n\\n. Furthermore, the instant case is materially distinct from Action Indus., Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 358 F.3d 337 (5th Cir.2004). There, the court determined \"that the parties\\' intent to replace the FAA\u2019s vacatur standard [could] not be gleaned from the Agreement\u2019s general choice-of-law provision, which provide[d] that Tennessee law governed] contractual execution and performance.\u201d Id. at 341. Thus, the arbitration clause did \"not in any way modify or replace the FAA\\'s rules.\" Id. However, in the instant case, the contractual modification is not premised on a general choice-of-law provision or a vague reference to a particular state\u2019s arbitration statute. Rather, the parties expressly adopted the ICC arbitration agreement and amended that agreement by inserting tailor-made appellate review language. Thus, the provision at issue is fundamentally different than the provision struck in Action Industries and more closely resembles the provisions approved of in Gateway and Harris. Last, as Action Industries recognizes, \"we construe ambiguous contractual language against the party who drafted it.\u201d Id. (citing Ford v. NYLCare Health Plans of the Gulf Coast, Inc., 141 F.3d 243, 249 (5th Cir.1998)). Therefore, we must construe the provision, and any ambiguities contained therein, against Prescott.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 9414306}, {'author_str': 'Stewart', 'per_curiam': False, 'type': '040dissent', 'page_count': None, 'download_url': None, 'author_id': None, 'opinion_text': '\\nCARL E. STEWART, Circuit Judge,\\ndissenting:\\nI respectfully dissent from the panel majority\u2019s conclusion that a clause that provides \u201cNo party waives appeal rights, if any, by signing this [arbitration] agreement,\u201d when considered on its face or when read in harmony with the other provisions of the parties\u2019 agreement, is ambiguous regarding the parties\u2019 intent to contract for a more expansive scope of review than that otherwise available pursuant to the FAA or the MUAA. The majority accurately sets forth the facts and procedural history of this case, so I will not repeat them here.\\nThe majority concludes that this clause, which speaks only in terms of \u201cappeal rights\u201d and contemplates that none may exist, at least arguably evidences the parties\u2019 intent \u201cto expand the scope of judicial review.\u201d The majority reaches this conclusion even though the clause neither identifies a question for our consideration that would not otherwise be reviewable under the FAA or MUAA nor refers to any particular level of scrutiny pursuant to which such review should be conducted. The majority further finds that certain \u201ccontractual tidbits ... strongly suggest that the parties intended judicial review to be available beyond the normal narrow range of the FAA or MUAA.\u201d Finally, notwithstanding its uncertainty regarding whether and to what extent the parties\u2019 agreement expanded the scope of judicial review, the majority concludes that this ambiguity requires that we remand the case to the district court to adduce evidence of the parties\u2019 intentions and \u201cinterpret the circumstances surrounding the making of this provision.\u201d Because I find the majority\u2019s determinations irreconcilable with the terms, context, and purpose of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement and our recent clarification in Action Industries, Inc. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 358 F.3d 337 (5th Cir.2004), regarding the level of exactitude required to opt-out of the narrow scope of review available under the governing arbitration statute, I must disagree with all three conclusions.\\n*499The majority begins its analysis by rejecting the district court\u2019s determination that the reference to the Montana Uniform Arbitration Act contained in the parties\u2019 submission agreement constituted a \u201cchoice-of-law\u201d provision governing the scope of judicial review of the arbitration award in the instant case. This provision provided that \u201cTHIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE MONTANA ARBITRATION ACT, TITLE 27, MONTANA CODE ANNOTATED.\u201d The district court reasoned that the MUAA, like the FAA, sets forth only limited grounds for vacatur or modification of an arbitration award, and that to \u201cexpand the scope of judicial review beyond that allowed by the law governing the arbitration process, the arbitration agreement must expressly and unambiguously evidence the parties\u2019 intent to do so.\u201d Finding no such express and unambiguous statement in the submission agreement\u2019s additional, handwritten provision that \u201cNo party waives appeal rights, if any, by signing this [arbitration] agreement,\u201d the district court concluded that the clause simply retained the few grounds for disturbing an arbitration award available under the MUAA.\\nAccording to the majority, our opinion in Valero Refining, 813 F.2d at 64-65 &amp; n. 5, compels the conclusion that the MUAA clause \u201ccontrols the procedures attendant to the arbitration, but not the interpretation of the underlying contract.\u201d The latter question, the majority reasons, must be determined under Louisiana law, in accordance with the general choice-of-law provision contained in the parties\u2019 employment agreement. While I agree that we must resort to state rules of construction to resolve any conflict between purportedly competing contractual provisions, the majority\u2019s reliance on Valero Refining is misplaced, and injects ambiguity into an agreement which, when properly considered as a whole, has none. And, even if I were to agree that the parties\u2019 intention regarding the applicable scope of judicial review is ambiguous, our opinion in Action Industries, Inc., 358 F.3d at 341-42, establishing that a clause must be clear and unambiguous to expand the statutory scope of review, makes it patently apparent that the clause at issue here fails to overcome the governing arbitration statute and its attendant narrow grounds for vaca-tur. I will address each of these points in turn.\\nIn Valero Refining, we rejected the assertion that a clause stipulating that the \u201claws of the City of New York\u201d would govern the arbitration proceeding1 invoked the then-controlling law of the Second Circuit, of which New York is a part, that RICO claims were not subject to arbitration. Id. at 65. We reasoned that the agreement\u2019s reference to New York law was not a choice-of-law clause requiring application of the Second Circuit\u2019s rule regarding arbitrability, but rather \u201cmerely require[d] that the procedures that the arbitrators use be in accordance with the laws applicable to New York City.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). The clause at issue in Valero Refining, however, is not comparable to the specific reference to the MUAA in the submission agreement before us. In Ford v. NYLCare Health Plans of the Gulf Coast Inc., 141 F.3d 243 (5th Cir.1998), relied upon by the district court, we held that a virtually identical reference to state law \u2014 in that case, to the Texas General Arbitration Act2 \u2014 unambiguously *500governed nothing less than every aspect of the arbitration under the agreement at issue, rejecting the assertion that the clause could be read to make the \u201cTGAA applicable only to the procedural aspects of arbitration.\u201d Id. at 249 (concluding that the reference to the TGAA unambiguously expressed the parties\u2019 intent to supercede the FAA rules with Texas arbitration law).\\nIt is clear under Ford that the MUAA clause sufficed to supercede the FAA\u2019s scope of review, and at least provisionally set forth the grounds for vacatur or modification of the arbitration award in the instant case. See id.; Action Industries, 358 F.3d at 342-43 (recognizing that an agreement\u2019s specific reference to a state arbitration statute would suffice to opt-out of the FAA standards for vacatur). The question thus becomes whether other language in the parties\u2019 agreement sufficed to overcome the MUAA clause. See Ford, 141 F.3d at 249. In this case the parties\u2019 rights and duties with respect to arbitration are set forth in two separate agreements: the employment contract, which contains an arbitration clause and incorporates the ICC\u2019s arbitration rules by reference, and a submission agreement, which supplements the parties\u2019 more general commitment to resolve their disputes through arbitration by defining the issues to be submitted to the arbitrator.\\nLike the MUAA clause, the clause at the core of this dispute, \u201cNo party waives appeal rights, if any, by signing this agreement,\u201d appears in the submission agreement. On its face, this \u201cno waiver\u201d clause indicates that the parties intended only to retain whatever appeal rights they had at the time they added that clause. The majority, rejecting this view as \u201cnot self-evident,\u201d finds that NCS\u2019s argument that such an interpretation renders the \u201cno waiver\u201d clause surplusage is sufficiently compelling to create an ambiguity in the parties\u2019 agreement. The majority is further persuaded by the purported absence of any other \u201cprovision concerning an appeal of an award\u201d in the parties\u2019 agreement. I disagree with both aspects of the majority\u2019s rationale and its ultimate conclusion that such an ambiguity exists.\\nFirst, the majority\u2019s reading \u2014 that the clause does not simply retain the MUAA standards\\' \u2014 renders the language \u201cif any\u201d surplusage, and it is the very inclusion of the phrase \u201cif any\u201d that evidences the parties\u2019 express contemplation that the entire clause may be redundant. As the majority acknowledges, under Louisiana law, an interpretation of a contract that has the effect of rendering a provision superfluous or meaningless must be avoided. See La. Civ.Code Art. 2049. Thus, we cannot, as the majority has done, leave out terms of a contract or render them surplusage and then declare that there is an ambiguity, itself a result of refusing to give effect to the contract\u2019s express provisions.\\nSecond, contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, the arbitration agreement at issue contains numerous provisions concerning \u201cappeal rights,\u201d all of which reaffirm the parties\u2019 intent that any arbitration award would be final and binding and not subject to appeal \u201cexcept as provided by law.\u201d In particular, the parties\u2019 employment agreement provided that the parties \u201cwaive their respective rights to file a lawsuit against one another in any civil courts for such disputes, except to enforce a legally binding arbitration decision.\" (emphasis added). The employment agreement also incorporated by reference the ICC rules, which in turn provided that \u201c[t]he arbitra*501tor\u2019s decision is final\u201d and \u201cshall be legally binding on the parties, except as provided by law,\u201d and, more specifically, \u201ccannot be considered or appealed except as provided by Rule 41 (Request for Reconsideration [by the arbitrator]) and\/or civil law.\u201d ICC Rules 40.E, G. Clause 2 of the submission agreement similarly provided that the arbitration would be \u201clegally binding.\u201d In Clause 3, the submission agreement reiterated that the parties \u201cagreed to \u2018abide by and perform any decision rendered by the arbitrator\u2019\u201d and that the parties \u201crealize that arbitration will be the exclusive remedy for this dispute and that [they] may not later litigate these matters in civil court.\u201d In short, these provisions establish the agreement\u2019s primary emphasis on the exclusivity and finality of arbitration as a means of resolving the instant dispute between the parties. All of these provisions support the conclusion that the parties\u2019 handwritten \u201cno waiver\u201d clause merely sought to preserve whatever narrow grounds for challenging an arbitration award that were available to them.\\nNor do the aptly-labeled \u201ccontractual tidbits\u201d cited by the majority compel the contrary conclusion that the parties\u2019 added language intended to expand the scope of judicial review. That the parties\u2019 agreement authorized \u201ca court of law\u201d to review written and oral communications might, as the majority concludes, support the notion that they contemplated an expanded review. However, it is also wholly consistent with an intent to allow consideration of the arbitration award only under the narrow grounds available under the FAA, or, in this case, the MUAA, which, for example, permit vacatur where an arbitrator\u2019s failure to consider relevant evidence has substantially prejudiced a party. See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(3); Mont.Code \u00a7 27-5-312(l)(d). In the absence of record evidence, or the authorization to review written and oral communications, the reviewing court would encounter great difficulty in assessing an alleged error by the arbitrator based on this ground.\\nSimilarly, Prescott\u2019s insistence that the arbitral proceedings be transcribed do not persuade me to lean in favor of finding an intent to expand the scope of judicial review. The application of a narrow scope of review (limiting the grounds open for our consideration) or a deferential standard of review (setting forth how hard we must look at such grounds) does not obviate the need for a record. See, e.g., Prestige Ford v. Ford Dealer Computer Servs., Inc., 324 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir.2003) (stating that, \u201c[g]iven the limited record available to this court, absent further documentation in the record suggesting a willful inattentiveness to the governing law, it would be difficult to find that the arbitration panel acted with manifest disregard for an applicable legal principle without undermining our stated deference for the arbitration process\u201d). In fact, the ICC Rules pursuant to which the parties\u2019 arbitration was conducted specifically allow such transcription, yet, as noted above, also expressly state that any resultant award \u201cshall be legally binding on the parties\u201d and \u201ccannot be considered or appealed except as provided by Rule 41 (Request for Reconsideration [by the arbitrator]) and\/or civil law.\u201d ICC Rules 40.E, G. Admittedly, the grounds available for disturbing an arbitration award pursuant to the FAA or MUAA are narrow; however, when they apply they do not provide for no review at all.\\nFinally, even if I were to agree with the majority that the \u201cno waiver\u201d clause at issue is ambiguous regarding the parties\u2019 intent to expand judicial review, the very existence of ambiguity means that at best this clause may be deemed a failed attempt to alter the scope of review otherwise available under the MUAA. Our recent decision in Action Industries, 358 F.3d at *502340-41, confirms the district court\u2019s rationale that the contractual language required to opt-out of the governing statutory scope of review must be \u201cclear and unambiguous.\u201d See id. at 841-42 (citing Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52, 59, 115 S.Ct. 1212, 131 L.Ed.2d 76 (1995); Hughes Training Inc. v. Cook, 254 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2001)). In Action Industries, we rejected the assertion that a general choice-of-law provision referencing Tennessee law, without reference to the Tennessee Uniform Arbitration Act, was insufficiently clear and unambiguous to evidence the parties\u2019 intent to opt-out of the FAA\u2019s grounds for vacatur of an arbitration award. Id. at 342. Notwithstanding the appellant\u2019s argument that this intent could be \u201cgleaned\u201d from this choice-of-law provision, we did not remand the matter to the district court to adduce further evidence regarding the parties\u2019 intent. Rather, once we determined that the parties\u2019 agreement did not specifically reference state arbitration law or specify, \u201cwith certain exactitude how the FAA [vacatur] rules [were] to be modified,\u201d we simply concluded that it failed as a matter of law to depart from the governing standard.\\nAs examples of clauses that met the requisite level of exactitude, the Action Industries panel pointed to the clauses in Gateway, 64 F.3d at 996, and Harris, 286 F.3d at 793, noting that in each case we held that the language employed \u201cevinced the parties\u2019 clear intent to depart from the FAA\u2019s vacatur standard.\u201d Action Industries, 358 F.3d at 342. Although the majority concedes that the \u201cno waiver\u201d clause at issue in this case is not \u201cas straightforward\u201d as the clauses we considered in Gateway and Harris, I cannot agree, in light of our opinion in Action Industries, that the lack of specificity in the \u201cno waiver\u201d clause can lead us to conclude anything other than it does not suffice to expand the scope of judicial review beyond the grounds available under the MUAA. Moreover, a close reading of Harris reveals that the opinion presciently recognized that to the extent a clause neither identifies with specificity a question for our consideration not otherwise available under the governing statutory standard nor refers to any particular level of scrutiny pursuant to which such review should be conducted, that clause will not successfully expand the scope of review.\\nIn Harris, we refined Gateway\u2019s, holding by establishing that an agreement that merely reserves the \u201cright to appeal any questions of law,\u201d does not necessarily mean that de novo review applies to all issues on appeal. See Harris, 286 F.3d at 793-94. At issue in Harris was the intended meaning of the phrase \u201cquestions of law.\u201d Id. The Harris panel found that the phrase was equally susceptible to two reasonable and conflicting interpretations, noting that it \u201ccould reasonably be interpreted to encompass solely \u2018pure\u2019 questions of law, [as the appellee argued,] or it could be read broadly, to encompass mixed questions of law and fact,\u201d as urged by the drafter-appellants. Id. at 793-94. Consequently, the Harris panel concluded that the reference to \u201cquestions of law\u201d was ambiguous, and construed the phrase against the drafter-appellants.3 Id. at 794. Significantly, the panel concluded that this *503not only dictated that de novo review apply only to pure questions of law, but that, \u201cwith respect to questions of fact and mixed questions of law and fact, we apply the default standard of review, vacating only for manifest disregard of the law, or on the grounds listed in the FAA.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\\nWe also found that the canon of contract construction requiring courts to \u201cgive effect to all contract provisions so that none will be rendered meaningless\u201d compelled our narrow interpretation of the clause. Id. We noted in Harris that because the arbitrator\u2019s legal conclusions \u201cwere intimately bound up with the facts,\u201d none of his findings would be final if we were to review de novo all mixed questions of fact and law. Id. Thus, we reasoned, a broad reading of \u201cquestions of law\u201d to encompass mixed questions would render meaningless \u201cthe provision that the arbitrator\u2019s award should be binding.\u201d Id. Accordingly, we concluded that \u201cquestions of law\u201d had to be construed as referring to only \u201cpure\u201d legal questions in order to give effect to this finality provision. We further pointed out that parties seeking \u201cmore extensive review of an arbitrator\u2019s award may do so by specifying the standard of review in the arbitration agreement.\u201d Id. (citing Hughes Training, 254 F.3d at 593 (enforcing a provision that stated that \u201cin actions seeking to vacate an [arbitration] award, the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law will be the same as that applied by an appellate court reviewing a decision of a trial court sitting without a jury\u201d)). The Harris panel noted that unlike in Hughes, \u201c[i]n the present case, the arbitration agreement simply did not specify that the standard of review for anything other than pure questions of law had been altered.\u201d Id.\\nIn light of our circuit precedent as clarified in Harris and Action Industries, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s view that a clause which, by the majority\u2019s own admission is at best ambiguous regarding the parties\u2019 intent to expand judicial review, requires remanding the matter for further inquiry into the circumstances surrounding its drafting. In Harris and Action Industries, we did not remand the matter for the district court to take evidence on the parties\u2019 intent; rather, we established that the applicable statutory standard would govern to the extent of the deficiency in specificity. See Harris, 286 F.3d at 794; Action Industries, 358 F.3d at 342. Because I find that by its terms, purpose, and context, the \u201cno waiver\u201d clause does not unambiguously expand the scope of judicial review and that a contrary interpretation would render other provisions pertaining to the finality of the award meaningless, I would affirm the district court\u2019s confirmation of the arbitration award. As the majority concedes, a remand would eviscerate whatever vestiges of efficient dispute resolution still exist in this case, an eventuality that is wholly inconsistent with the parties\u2019 undisputed intent to resolve their claims exclusively through arbitration. The parties have already asserted their respective conflicting interpretations to the district court and this court, and I am unpersuaded that they will shed any greater light on their respective positions should they find themselves before the district court for a reprise. I further note that it is inevitable that one side in an arbitration would be dissatisfied with the result. Absent clear and unambiguous contractual language to the contrary, however, I find that the scope of our review is limited to consideration of the narrow grounds for vacatur or modification of the award that exist at law. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n. The clause at issue provided: \"Any and all differences and disputes of whatsoever nature arising out of this Charter shall be put to arbitration in the City of New York pursuant to the laws relating to arbitration there in force.\u201d Valero Refining, 813 F.2d at 64 n. 5.\\n\\n\\n. The arbitration agreement stated that arbitration of any claim must be settled \u201cin accor*500dance with the Texas General Arbitration Act\u201d and, as in this case, contained a notice providing: \"THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THE TEXAS GENERAL ARBITRATION ACT.\u201d Ford, 141 F.3d at 249.\\n\\n\\n. Unlike Harris, however, in the instant case the parties\\' employment contract provided that \"This contract shall be interpreted under ...

FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") appeals various rulings of the district court in its suit against Peabody Western Coal Company (\"Peabody\"). Peabody leases mines from the Navajo Nation (\"the Nation\"), and maintains a preference for employing Navajo workers at these mines. EEOC alleges that in maintaining its employment preference Peabody discriminates against non-Navajo Indians, including two members of the Hopi Nation and one member of the Otoe tribe, in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). The district court first dismissed EEOC\\'s suit in 2002. EEOC v. Peabody Coal Co. (\"Peabody I\"), 214 F.R.D. 549 (D.Ariz.2002). We heard EEOC\\'s appeal from that dismissal in EEOC v. Peabody Western Coal Co. (\"Peabody II\"), 400 F.3d 774 (9th Cir.2005). We reversed, holding that it was feasible to join the Nation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 and that the suit did not present a nonjusticiable political question. On remand, the district court granted summary judgment to Peabody. EEOC appeals.\\nIn this appeal, we address questions arising out of the joinder of two different parties. We first address the joinder of the Nation. We hold that the amended complaint filed by EEOC after our remand does not render it infeasible to join the Nation. We next address the joinder of the Secretary of the Interior (\"the Secretary\"). We hold that the Secretary is a required party under Rule 19(a), and that joining him is not feasible. We hold further that Peabody and the Nation may not bring a third-party damages claim against the Secretary under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 14(a), and that EEOC\\'s claim against Peabody for damages must therefore be dismissed under Rule 19(b). However, we hold that Peabody and the Nation may bring a third-party claim against the Secretary for prospective relief under Rule 14(a), and that EEOC\\'s injunctive claim against Peabody should therefore be allowed to proceed.\\nWe vacate the remainder of the district court\\'s rulings and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\nI. Background\\n\\nA. Factual Background\\nPeabody mines coal at the Black Mesa Complex and Kayenta Mine on the Navajo and Hopi reservations in northeastern Arizona. Peabody does so pursuant to leases with the Navajo and Hopi tribes inherited from its predecessor-in-interest, Sentry Royalty Company (\"Sentry\"). This case involves two leases Sentry entered into with the Nation: a 1964 lease permitting it to mine on the Navajo reservation (lease no. 8580) and a 1966 lease permitting it to mine on the Navajo portion of land jointly used by the Navajo and Hopi nations (lease no. 9910).\\nBoth leases require that Peabody provide an employment preference to Navajo job applicants. The 1964 lease provides *1075 that Peabody \"agrees to employ Navajo Indians when available in all positions for which, in the judgment of[Peabody], they are qualified,\" and that Peabody \"shall make a special effort to work Navajo Indians into skilled, technical and other higher jobs in connection with [Peabody\\'s] operations under this Lease.\" The 1966 lease provides similarly, but also states that Peabody may \"at its option extend the benefits of this Article [containing the Navajo employment preference] to Hopi Indians.\" We will refer to these provisions as \"Navajo employment preference provisions.\" Many business leases on the Navajo reservation contain similar employment preferences for Navajo job applicants.\\nAs we noted in Peabody II, the Department of the Interior (\"DOI\") approved both mining leases, as well as subsequent amendments and extensions, under the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (\"IMLA\"). Peabody II, 400 F.3d at 776; see 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 396a, 396e; see also United States v. Navajo Nation (\"Navajo Nation I\"), 537 U.S. 488, 493, 123 S.Ct. 1079, 155 L.Ed.2d 60 (2003) (explaining that DOI\\'s approval is necessary before leases on reservation land become effective). Former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, who served as Secretary during the period the leases were drafted and approved, stated in a declaration submitted to the district court that DOI drafted the leases and required the inclusion of the Navajo employment preferences. This statement is undisputed. The leases provide that, if their terms are violated, both the Nation and the Secretary retain the power to cancel them after a notice and cure period. Amendments to the leases must be approved by the Secretary.\\n\\nB. Procedural Background\\nThis is the latest in a series of cases involving Navajo employment preferences. See Dawavendewa v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement &amp; Power Dist. (\"Dawavendewa II\"), 276 F.3d 1150, 1163 (9th Cir.2002); Dawavendewa v. Salt River Agric. Improvement &amp; Power Dist. (\"Dawavendewa I\"), 154 F.3d 1117, 1124 (9th Cir.1998). We discussed the history of Navajo employment preferences in detail in the first appeal in this case. See Peabody II, 400 F.3d at 777.\\nEEOC filed this suit against Peabody in June 2001, alleging that Peabody was unlawfully discriminating on the basis of national origin by implementing the Navajo employment preferences contained in the leases. EEOC\\'s complaint charged that Peabody had refused to hire non-Navajo Indians including two members of the Hopi and one now-deceased member of the Otoe tribe, as well as unspecified other non-Navajo Indians, for positions for which they were otherwise qualified. EEOC alleged that such conduct violated Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1), which prohibits employers from refusing to hire applicants because of their national origin. EEOC\\'s position throughout this litigation has been that the Indian preference exception of Title VII, \u00a7 2000e-2(i), permits discrimination in favor of Indians living on or near a particular tribe\\'s reservation, but does not permit discrimination against Indians who live on or near that reservation but are members of another tribe. Peabody II, 400 F.3d at 777-78. EEOC alleged further that Peabody had violated the recordkeeping requirements of \u00a7 2000e-8(c). EEOC requested three forms of relief: (1) an injunction prohibiting Peabody from continuing to discriminate on the basis of national origin and requiring Peabody to provide equal employment opportunities for non-Navajo Indians living on or near the Navajo reservation; (2) damages, including back pay with interest, compensatory damages, and punitive damages; and *1076 (3) an order requiring Peabody to make and preserve records in compliance with Title VII.\\nPeabody moved for summary judgment and for dismissal of the action. Peabody argued, first, that Rule 19 required dismissal because the Nation was a necessary and indispensable party to the action and, second, that the action presented a nonjusticiable political question between EEOC and DOI because DOI had approved the mining leases. The district court agreed and granted Peabody\\'s motion to dismiss on both grounds. Peabody I, 214 F.R.D. at 559-63. The district court also dismissed EEOC\\'s recordkeeping claim, even though Peabody had not sought dismissal of this claim. Id. at 563.\\nWe reversed in Peabody II. First, we held that the Nation was a necessary party under Rule 19, but that EEOC\\'s suit need not be dismissed because joinder of the Nation was feasible. Peabody II, 400 F.3d at 780-81. Because EEOC is an agency of the United States, the Nation could not assert sovereign immunity as a defense to joinder. Although EEOC lacked statutory authority to state a cause of action against the Nation, joinder of the Nation for the purposes of res judicata was still possible and would be effective in providing \"complete relief between the parties.\" Id. at 781. Second, we held that EEOC\\'s claim did not present a nonjusticiable political question. Id. at 784-85. Third, we held that the district court erred in dismissing EEOC\\'s recordkeeping claim. Id. at 785. We remanded for further proceedings with the Nation joined under Rule 19. Id. at 785.\\nOn remand, EEOC filed an amended complaint that included the same claims and prayer for relief as its initial complaint. The newly joined Nation moved to dismiss under Rule 19, arguing, inter alia, that EEOC\\'s amended complaint impermissibly seeks affirmative relief against the Nation, and that the Secretary of the Interior is a necessary and indispensable party. Peabody filed its own motion to dismiss. Inter alia, it agreed with the Nation\\'s argument that the Secretary was a necessary and indispensable party. This was the first time in this litigation that anyone had argued that the Secretary was a necessary and indispensable party.\\nThe district court converted the motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment against EEOC, holding, in the alternative, that (1) EEOC was seeking affirmative relief against the Nation in its amended complaint, and that the Nation therefore could not be joined under Rule 19; (2) the Secretary was a necessary and indispensable party for whom joinder was not feasible; and (3) the Rehabilitation Act of 1950, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 631-638, authorized the tribe-specific preferences challenged by EEOC. The district court also granted the Nation\\'s motions to strike two EEOC exhibits and to strike an EEOC footnote reference. Finally, the court denied EEOC\\'s motion to strike two forms upon which Peabody relied. EEOC timely appealed all of the district court\\'s rulings.\\nWe reach only holdings (1) and (2), as to which we reverse the district court. We vacate the rest of the court\\'s decision and remand for further proceedings.\\n\\nII. Standard of Review\\nWe review a district court\\'s decision on joinder for abuse of discretion, and we review the legal conclusions underlying that decision de novo. Peabody II, 400 F.3d at 778.\\n\\nIII. Discussion\\nThis case continues to present somewhat complex compulsory party joinder issues. *1077 As we explained in Peabody II, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 governs compulsory party joinder in federal district courts. In its recently amended form, Rule 19 provides, in relevant part:\\n(a) Persons Required to Be Joined if Feasible.\\n(1) Required Party.\\nA person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:\\n(A) in that person\\'s absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or\\n(B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person\\'s absence may:\\n(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person\\'s ability to protect the interest; or\\n(ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.\\n(2) Joinder by Court Order.\\nIf a person has not been joined as required, the court must order that the person be made a party. A person who refuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.\\n. . .\\n(b) When Joinder Is Not Feasible.\\nIf a person who is required to be joined if feasible cannot be joined, the court must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed. The factors for the court to consider include:\\n(1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person\\'s absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties;\\n(2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by:\\n(A) protective provisions in the judgment;\\n(B) shaping the relief; or\\n(C) other measures;\\n(3) whether a judgment rendered in the person\\'s absence would be adequate; and\\n(4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder....\\nFed.R.Civ.P. 19. Although the wording of Rule 19 has changed since the district court dismissed this case, its meaning remains the same.[1] When dealing with the *1078 amended rule in this opinion, we will use the new language.\\nA Rule 19 motion poses \"three successive inquiries.\" Peabody II, 400 F.3d at 779. \"First, the court must determine whether a nonparty should be joined under Rule 19(a).\" Id. That nonparty (or \"absentee\") is now referred to as a \"person required to be joined if feasible.\" If an absentee meets the requirements of Rule 19(a), \"the second stage is for the court to determine whether it is feasible to order that the absentee be joined.\" Id. \"Finally, if joinder is not feasible, the court must determine at the third stage whether the case can proceed without the absentee\" or whether the action must be dismissed. Id. A nonparty in whose absence an action must be dismissed is one who \"not only [has] an interest in the controversy, but [has] an interest of such a nature that a final decree cannot be made without either affecting that interest, or leaving the controversy in such a condition that its final termination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience.\" Shields v. Barrow, 58 U.S. 130, 139, 17 How. 130, 15 L.Ed. 158 (1855). With these principles in mind, we consider the Rule 19 joinder of both the Navajo Nation and the Secretary of the Interior.\\n\\nA. Joinder of the Navajo Nation under Rule 19\\nIn Peabody II, we held that the Navajo Nation was a necessary party for whom joinder was feasible. Peabody II, 400 F.3d at 778. It is undisputed that the Nation was a necessary party, and is now, under the amended rule, a person required to be joined if feasible. As we explained in Peabody II, the Nation is a party to the leases whose employment preference is challenged in this lawsuit.\\nIf the EEOC is victorious in this suit but the Nation has not been joined, the Nation could possibly initiate further action to enforce the employment preference against Peabody, even though that preference would have been held illegal in this litigation. Peabody would then be, like the defendant in Dawavendewa II, 276 F.3d at 1156, \"between the proverbial rock and a hard place\\x97comply with the injunction prohibiting the hiring preference policy or comply with the lease requiring it.\" By similar logic, we have elsewhere found that tribes are necessary parties to actions that might have the result of directly undermining authority they would otherwise exercise.\\nId. at 780. We held that it was feasible to join the Nation even though under Title VII no affirmative relief was available to EEOC against the Nation.\\nAfter our remand, EEOC amended its complaint to add the Nation as a defendant. The district court held that EEOC sought affirmative relief against the Nation in its amended complaint even though we had specifically held in Peabody II that such relief was not available. Under its reading of EEOC\\'s amended complaint, the district court dismissed EEOC\\'s suit on the ground that the Nation could not, after all, be joined. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the district court should not have dismissed EEOC\\'s amended complaint on this ground.\\nIn Peabody II, Peabody made two arguments why joinder of the Nation was not feasible. We disagreed with both of them. First, Peabody argued that the Nation could not be joined because of sovereign immunity. Id. at 780. We held that the Nation\\'s sovereign immunity did not shield it from a suit brought by EEOC and therefore did not bar its joinder. Id. at 781. We explained, \"Tribal sovereign immunity does not `act as a shield against the United States,\\' even when Congress has not specifically abrogated tribal immunity.\" Id. *1079 (quoting United States v. Yakima Tribal Ct., 806 F.2d 853, 861 (9th Cir.1986)).\\nSecond, Peabody argued that because Title VII exempts the Nation from the definition of employer, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b), EEOC could not state a claim against the Nation. Peabody II, 400 F.3d at 781. Therefore, Peabody argued, the Nation could not be joined in a suit brought by EEOC. But \"a plaintiff\\'s inability to state a direct cause of action against an absentee does not prevent the absentee\\'s joinder under Rule 19.\" Id. An absentee can be joined under Rule 19 in order to subject it, under principles of res judicata, to the \"minor and ancillary\" effects of a judgment. Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass\\'n, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 399, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982). We wrote that\\nEEOC has no claim against the party it seeks to join and is not seeking any affirmative relief directly from that party. Joinder is necessary for the \"sole purpose\" of effecting complete relief between the parties ... by ensuring that both Peabody and the Nation are bound to any judgment upholding or striking down the challenged lease provision.\\nPeabody II, 400 F.3d at 783.\\nOn remand, the district court concluded that EEOC\\'s amended complaint sought affirmative relief against the Nation. The district court found that \"with the benefit of the filing of the Amended Complaint and limited discovery, it is apparent to this Court that the EEOC is not merely seeking relief against Peabody Coal, but all parties acting in concert with it, which includes the Navajo Nation.\" In so holding, the district court relied on the language in the amended complaint seeking \"a permanent injunction enjoining Peabody... and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in discrimination on the basis of national origin.\" The court found that\\nthere can be no doubt that the Navajo Nation falls within the scope of affirmative relief sought by the EEOC.... Should the EEOC prevail in this suit and obtain the broad relief sought, the Navajo Nation would then be enjoined from implementing and requiring such lease provisions in the future as it would already be subject to injunctive relief from this Court based upon the determination that such provisions are contrary to Title VII. As such, there can be little doubt that the EEOC seeks affirmative relief not only against Peabody Coal but the Navajo Nation as well.\\nThe language added to the amended complaint provides, in its entirety:\\nDefendant Navajo Nation is a party to a lease agreement with the Defendant employer, Peabody Coal Company, and is therefore named as a party pursuant to Rule 19(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in that, in its absence, complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, and it has an interest in the subject of this action.\\nThis added language says nothing about any kind of relief against the Nation.\\nThe original complaint was before us when we decided Peabody II. The language in the amended complaint upon which the district court relied to conclude that EEOC was seeking affirmative relief is word-for-word the same as in the original complaint. It is, in its entirety:\\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court:\\nA. Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Peabody, its officers, successors, assigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in discrimination on the basis of national origin.\\n*1080 Some of this added language is standard boilerplate drawn from Rule 65(d)(2)(C), describing the \"persons bound\" by \"every injunction\" as including \"other persons who are in active concert or participation\" with the party or parties served with an injunction.\\nThere are two possible readings of the amended complaint. Under one reading, EEOC is not seeking any injunctive relief against the Nation. The Nation is \"bound\" by the injunction only in the sense that it is res judicata as to the Nation, not in the sense that the injunction affirmatively requires the Nation to do something. In our view, this is the better reading of the boilerplate language in the complaint, given that the explicit premise of our holding in Peabody II was that EEOC has no cause of action against the Nation under Title VII and that, as a necessary corollary, EEOC can obtain no injunctive relief against the Nation. However, the district court did not adopt this reading.\\nUnder the reading adopted by the district court, EEOC sought injunctive relief against the Nation in its amended complaint. Even if this is the correct reading, the district court nonetheless erred in dismissing EEOC\\'s suit. Because we had held in Peabody II that joinder of the Nation was feasible despite the unavailability of injunctive relief against it, the proper response of the district court would have been simply to deny EEOC\\'s request for injunctive relief. As we held in Peabody II, joinder of the Nation is feasible, and dismissal under Rule 19 is not required even though injunctive relief is unavailable.\\nThe district court therefore erred in dismissing EEOC\\'s complaint on the ground that it sought injunctive relief against the Nation.\\n\\nB. Joinder of the Secretary of the Interior under Rule 19\\nOn remand from Peabody II, Peabody and the newly joined Nation argued under Rule 19 that the suit could not proceed without joinder of the Secretary. Even though Peabody had been a defendant in the suit from the outset, this was the first time it made this argument. Because the Nation had just been joined, this was its first opportunity to make the argument. We agree with Peabody and the Nation that the Secretary is a person to be joined if feasible under Rule 19. But we do not agree that the entirety of EEOC\\'s suit must be dismissed.\\nThe central problem is that Peabody is caught in the middle of a dispute not of its own making. EEOC contends that the Navajo employment preference provision contained in the leases violates Title VII. The Secretary required that this provision be included in the leases. EEOC seeks damages and an injunction against Peabody, which has complied with the lease terms upon which the Secretary insisted.\\nIf the district court were to hold that the Navajo employment preference provision violates Title VII and to award damages against Peabody, it would be profoundly unfair if Peabody could not seek indemnification from the Secretary. It would be similarly unfair if the district court were to grant an injunction requiring Peabody to disregard the preference provision, but leaving the Secretary free, despite the court\\'s holding, to insist that Peabody comply with it.\\nThe same is true, though to a lesser extent, for the Nation. As we held in Peabody II, EEOC can obtain neither damages nor injunctive relief against the Nation. But if the district court holds that the employment preference provision violates Title VII, the Nation will be bound to that result by res judicata. If the Secretary *1081 is not made a party to the suit, he may ignore the court\\'s judgment and place conflicting demands upon the Nation who will be required by res judicata to honor the judgment.\\n\\n1. The Secretary as a Required Party under Rule 19(a)\\nA person is required to be joined if feasible under Rule 19(a)(1)(A) if, \"in that person\\'s absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among the existing parties\" or under Rule 19(a)(1)(B) if \"that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person\\'s absence may: (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person\\'s ability to protect the interest; or (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.\" \"There is no precise formula for determining whether a particular nonparty should be joined under Rule 19(a).... The determination is heavily influenced by the facts and circumstances of each case.\" N. Alaska Envtl. Ctr. v. Hodel, 803 F.2d 466, 468 (9th Cir. 1986) (quoting Bakia v. County of Los Angeles, 687 F.2d 299, 301 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam)) (alterations in original). The Secretary meets the standards of both Rule 19(a)(1)(A) and Rule 19(a)(1)(B).\\nFirst, under Rule 19(a)(1)(A), in the absence of the Secretary, the district court cannot accord complete relief among the existing parties. The record makes clear that the Secretary insisted that the disputed employment preference provision be included in the leases between Peabody and the Nation, and that the Secretary is ultimately responsible for its continued inclusion in the leases. If EEOC prevails in its interpretation of Title VII, it may recover damages from Peabody based on Peabody\\'s compliance with the employment preference provision. In that event, Peabody will be obliged to pay damages for having engaged in conduct that was mandated by the Secretary. If the Secretary is not made a party, Peabody will not be able to seek indemnification from the Secretary.\\nFurther, if EEOC prevails it may obtain an injunction ordering Peabody to disregard the employment preference provision. The Secretary has the power, if the lease terms are violated, to cancel the leases after a notice and cure period, and Peabody is unable to modify the terms of the leases without the approval of the Secretary. If the Secretary is not made a party, Peabody may be obliged by the court to disregard the preference provision, while the Secretary would remain free to insist that Peabody honor it, upon pain of losing the leases. See, e.g., Associated Dry Goods Corp. v. Towers Fin. Corp., 920 F.2d 1121, 1124 (2d Cir.1990) (holding that landlord was required party in suit brought by tenant against subtenant, as subtenant would not be able to obtain complete relief in counterclaims against tenant for increased electrical capacity without approval of landlord); Wymbs v. Republican State Executive Comm., 719 F.2d 1072, 1080 (11th Cir.1983) (holding that national political party committee was required party in suit on the constitutionality of a local political party\\'s delegate selection rule when the local rule was derived from the national rule and the national party still had the ability to determine which delegates would be seated).\\nSecond, under Rule 19(a)(1)(B), the Secretary has an interest in the subject matter of this action. Resolving this action in the Secretary\\'s absence may both impair the Secretary\\'s ability to protect that interest and leave Peabody and the Nation subject to a substantial risk of incurring inconsistent obligations. If the *1082 Secretary is not joined, he will be unable to defend his interest in the legality of the lease provisions. We have repeatedly held that \"[n]o procedural principle is more deeply imbedded in the common law than that, in an action to set aside a lease or a contract, all parties who may be affected by the determination of the action are indispensable.\" Lomayaktewa v. Hathaway, 520 F.2d 1324, 1325(9th Cir.1975); see also Dawavendewa II, 276 F.3d at 1156.\\nAlthough Lomayaktewa and Dawavendewa II involved parties who were signatories to a contract, which the Secretary is not, the underlying principle applies here. The Secretary mandated the provisions and continues to exercise oversight over the leases. A public entity has an interest in a lawsuit that could result in the invalidation or modification of one of its ordinances, rules, regulations, or practices. See, e.g., Davis v. United States, 192 F.3d 951, 959 (10th Cir.1999) (holding that Seminole Nation of Oklahoma was necessary party as a ruling on the merits would modify the Nation\\'s ordinances); Ricci v. State Bd. of Law Exam\\'rs, 569 F.2d 782, 784 (3d Cir.1978) (holding that Pennsylvania Supreme Court was indispensable party to an action that would, if it succeeded, invalidate one of the Court\\'s rules of admission). The Secretary thus has an interest in an action that would require him to modify the terms of leases he approves for entities conducting business on the Navajo reservation. The Secretary therefore qualifies as a person to be joined under Rule 19(a)(1)(B)(i).\\nIf the Secretary is not made a party and if EEOC prevails, the Secretary may choose to cancel the leases or to modify them to eliminate the Navajo employment preference. Alternatively, the Secretary may choose to continue the leases in their current form, ignoring the judgment in the case to which he has not been made a party. If the Secretary chooses to do this, he will put both Peabody and the Nation \"between the proverbial rock and a hard place,\" Peabody II, 400 F.3d at 780 (quoting Dawavendewa II, 276 F.3d at 1156), forcing them to choose between complying with the injunction or risking cancellation of the leases for violating terms mandated by the Secretary. The Secretary therefore qualifies as a person to be joined under Rule 19(a)(1)(B)(ii).\\nEEOC argues that the Secretary is not a person required to be joined under Rule 19(a), citing to the Navajo Nation line of cases decided by the Supreme Court. In these cases, the Court held that the DOI did not owe a fiduciary duty to the Navajo Nation in managing, negotiating, or approving leases under the statutes at issue in this litigation, and that the Nation therefore could not state a cause of action against DOI for breach of fiduciary duty. United States v. Navajo Nation (\"Navajo Nation II\"), ___ U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1547, 1558, 173 L.Ed.2d 429 (2009) (holding that the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950 and Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 do not provide a cause of action to the Navajo Nation against the United States for breach of trust in its approval of coal mining leases); Navajo Nation I, 537 U.S. at 506, 123 S.Ct. 1079 (holding the same for the IMLA). These cases indicate the limits of DOI\\'s fiduciary duty to the Nation with respect to the leases, but they say nothing about whether DOI possesses a cognizable interest in the outcome of litigation challenging lease terms mandated by the Secretary.\\nWe therefore hold that the Secretary is a person required to be joined if feasible under Rule 19(a)(1)(A) and Rule 19(a)(1)(B).\\n\\n\\n*1083 2. Feasibility of Joining the Secretary\\nRule 19(a) contemplates that a required party be joined as either a plaintiff or defendant. In the posture of this suit, the Secretary would be joined as a defendant rather than a plaintiff. However, we conclude that EEOC cannot join the Secretary as a defendant.\\nEEOC is prevented by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) from filing suit against the Secretary on its own authority. Section 2000e-5(f)(1) provides that if EEOC is not able to obtain a conciliation agreement with a governmental agency, it cannot itself bring suit against that agency. Instead, \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) provides that if EEOC is unable to obtain an agreement, it \"shall take no further action and shall refer the case to the Attorney General who may bring a civil action against such respondent in the appropriate United States district court.\" We were told at oral argument by EEOC\\'s attorney that EEOC has no expectation that the Attorney General will file suit against the Secretary. While there is no evidence in the record of a formal referral to and refusal by the Attorney General, we assume for purposes of our decision that the Attorney General either has refused or will refuse to file suit against the Secretary.\\n\\n3. Dismissal \"In Equity and Good Conscience\"\\nIf a required party under Rule 19(a) cannot be joined as a plaintiff or defendant, we look to the factors provided in Rule 19(b) to determine whether, \"in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b). Rule 19(b) provides four factors that we must consider in making this determination: (1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person\\'s absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties; (2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by shaping the judgment or the relief; (3) whether a judgment rendered in the person\\'s absence would be adequate; and (4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed. Id. The heart of this inquiry is the question of \"equity and good conscience.\" See Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U.S. 102, 125, 88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968); Dawavendewa II, 276 F.3d at 1161. \"The inquiry is a practical one and fact specific ... and is designed to avoid the harsh results of rigid application.\" Makah Indian Tribe v. Verity, 910 F.2d 555, 558(9th Cir.1990) (internal citations omitted).\\nFor the reasons that follow, we conclude that EEOC\\'s claim for damages against Peabody must be dismissed under Rule 19(b), but that its claim for an injunction against Peabody should be permitted to proceed.\\n\\na. EEOC\\'s Claim for Damages\\nIf EEOC\\'s suit against Peabody were allowed to proceed, the district court would almost certainly award damages against Peabody if it concludes that the Navajo employment preference provision violates Title VII. In that event, Peabody would quite reasonably look to the Secretary for indemnification, given that the preference provision was included in the leases at the insistence of the Secretary. Rule 14(a) would permit Peabody to file a third-party complaint against the Secretary for indemnification. But because Peabody\\'s indemnification suit would seek damages, it would be barred by the government\\'s sovereign immunity unless that immunity is waived by statute. We can find no waiver of sovereign immunity to such a suit.\\n*1084 The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2), waives the government\\'s sovereign immunity in damage suits based on contract, as well as for some claims arising under the Constitution and statutes of the United States. Under the Tucker Act, a party\\'s claims must either rest upon a contract, \"seek the return of money paid by them to the Government,\" or establish an entitlement to money damages under a federal statute that \"`can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained.\\'\" United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 400, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976) (quoting Eastport S.S. Corp. v. United States, 178 Ct.Cl. 599, 372 F.2d 1002, 1009 (1967)); see also Lake Mohave Boat Owners Ass\\'n v. Nat\\'l Park Serv., 78 F.3d 1360, 1365 (9th Cir.1995). The Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), waives the sovereign immunity of the United States for suits in tort. See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 477, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). However, neither the Tucker Act nor the Federal Tort Claims Act waives the government\\'s sovereign immunity in the circumstances of this case.\\nTitle VII also waives the government\\'s sovereign immunity to some extent. Based on that waiver, a federal employee may sue the government for damages under Title VII, provided that administrative remedies with EEOC have been exhausted. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c); see Library of Cong. v. Shaw, 478 U.S. 310, 319, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 92 L.Ed.2d 250(\"Congress waived the Government\\'s immunity under Title VII as a defendant, affording federal employees a right of action against the Government for its discriminatory acts as an employer.\"); cf. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976) (Title VII abrogates the states\\' sovereign immunity). But we can find nothing in Title VII that waives the government\\'s sovereign immunity to a damages suit brought by a private employer that has itself violated Title VII.\\nPeabody\\'s only sin, if indeed it was a sin, was to comply with an employment preference provision inserted in its lease at the insistence of the Secretary. It would be profoundly unfair for a court to award damages against Peabody while allowing Peabody no redress against the government. We are unable to see any way to mitigate this unfairness by, for example, \"protective provisions in the judgment;... shaping relief; or ... other measures.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b)(2)(A-C). We therefore conclude that \"in equity and good conscience\" EEOC\\'s damages claim against Peabody must be dismissed under Rule 19(b).\\n\\nb. EEOC\\'s Claim for an Injunction\\nIf EEOC\\'s suit is allowed to proceed and if the district court were to hold that the Navajo employment preference provision violates Title VII, the district court would almost certainly grant an injunction requiring Peabody to ignore the provision in making its employment decisions. This injunction would not only require Peabody to take certain actions; it would also operate as res judicata against the Nation. In the event such an injunction were issued, Peabody and the Nation would quite reasonably want to seek prospective relief preventing the Secretary from enforcing the provision. Rule 14(a) would permit Peabody and the Nation to file a third-party complaint seeking such relief against the Secretary. Sovereign immunity does not bar prospective injunctive relief against the Secretary. We conclude that the availability of prospective relief through a third-party complaint under Rule 14(a) means that \"in equity and *1085 good conscience\" EEOC\\'s suit against Peabody should be permitted to proceed.\\n\\ni. Sovereign Immunity\\nA claim to which sovereign immunity is not a defense may be entertained even if another claim in the suit is dismissed because of sovereign immunity. See, e.g., United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 159, 126 S.Ct. 877, 163 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006) (finding sovereign immunity of state was not a bar to some of the plaintiffs\\' claims and remanding to the district court to allow suit to proceed for any claims that were not shielded by sovereign immunity). Therefore, the district court may entertain Peabody and the Nation\\'s third-party claim for prospective relief if it is not barred by the United States\\' sovereign immunity, even if a Peabody claim for damages would have to be dismissed.\\nProspective relief requiring, or having the effect of requiring, governmental officials to obey the law has long been available. Sovereign immunity does not bar such relief. The case often cited for this proposition is Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), which permitted an injunction against the Attorney General of Minnesota despite the Eleventh Amendment. The Ex parte Young fiction remains the basis for prospective relief against state officers. For example, in Verizon Maryland, Inc. v. Public Service Commission, 535 U.S. 635, 122 S.Ct. 1753, 152 L.Ed.2d 871 (2002), the Supreme Court allowed injunctive and declaratory relief against individual state officials despite the Eleventh Amendment.\\nFor a number of years, prospective relief against federal officials was available under the fiction of Ex parte Young. For example, in Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949), the Supreme Court allowed prospective relief against a federal official despite an asserted defense of sovereign immunity. The Court wrote:\\nThere may be, of course, suits for specific relief against officers of the sovereign which are not suits against the sovereign. If the officer purports to act as an individual and not as an official, a suit directed against that action is not a suit against the sovereign.... [W]here the officer\\'s powers are limited by statute, his actions beyond those limitations are considered individual and not sovereign actions. The officer is not doing the business which the sovereign has empowered him to do or he is doing it in a way which the sovereign has forbidden. His actions are ultra vires his authority and therefore may be made the object of specific relief.\\nId. at 689, 69 S.Ct. 1457. We explicitly followed the \"legal fiction\" described in Larson in Washington v. Udall, 417 F.2d 1310, 1314 (9th Cir.1969), and did so again in Rockbridge v. Lincoln, 449 F.2d 567, 572-73 (9th Cir.1971).\\nHowever, since 1976 federal courts have looked to \u00a7 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, to serve the purposes of the Ex parte Young fiction in suits against federal officers. In Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) v. United States, 870 F.2d 518 (9th Cir.1989), we explained that after \u00a7 702 was amended in 1976, it replaced the Ex parte Young fiction as the doctrinal basis for a claim for prospective relief. We wrote:\\nIt is particularly significant that [in enacting \u00a7 702 of the APA] Congress referred disapprovingly to the Ex parte Young fiction, which permitted a plaintiff to name a government official as the defendant in equitable actions to redress government misconduct, on the pretense that the suit was not actually against the government. By invoking the Young fiction plaintiffs could, even before Congress *1086 amended \u00a7 702 in 1976, maintain an action for equitable relief against unconstitutional government conduct, whether or not such conduct constituted \"agency action\" in the APA sense. See, e.g., Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp. ... Congress\\' plain intent in amending \u00a7 702 was to waive sovereign immunity for all such suits, thereby eliminating the need to invoke the Young fiction.\\n\\nId. at 525-26 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).\\nIn Presbyterian Church we wrote, \"On its face, the 1976 amendment [to \u00a7 702] is an unqualified waiver of sovereign immunity in actions seeking nonmonetary relief against legal wrongs for which governmental agencies are accountable.\" 870 F.2d at 525. We explained that the waiver is not limited to judicial review in suits challenging \"agency action\" as defined in the APA, but instead covers \"all actions seeking relief from official misconduct except for money damages.\" Id. In Gallo Cattle Co. v. United States Department of Agriculture, 159 F.3d 1194 (9th Cir.1998), we stated that \"the APA\\'s waiver of sovereign immunity contains several limitations,\" including the \"final agency action\" requirement that we had considered irrelevant in Presbyterian Church. Id. at 1198. We held that, because the plaintiffs failed to challenge \"final agency action,\" the waiver of sovereign immunity did not apply. Id. In Gros Ventre Tribe v. United States, 469 F.3d 801 (9th Cir.2006), we discussed but declined to resolve the tension between the two cases, observing that there is \"no way to distinguish The Presbyterian Church from Gallo Cattle.\" Id. at 809.\\nWe similarly need not resolve this tension here. Unlike in Gallo Cattle, there is final agency action in this case, because the Secretary has mandated the disputed lease terms. \"Agency action\" under the APA is defined as \"the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(13). \"Persons\" entitled to judicial review under the APA include \"an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization other than an agency.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(b)(2)(providing that, for purposes of provisions on judicial review, definition of \"person\" in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 applies); id. \u00a7 551(providing definition of \"person\"). Both Peabody and the Navajo Nation come within this definition of \"person.\" Peabody is a corporation, and the Nation is a \"public organization.\" Id. Therefore, under \u00a7 702 of the APA, as would be the case under the Ex parte Young fiction, either Peabody or the Nation may assert a claim against the Secretary requesting injunctive or declaratory relief. We therefore conclude that neither Peabody nor the Nation is barred by sovereign immunity from bringing a thirdparty complaint seeking prospective relief against the Secretary under Rule 14(a).\\n\\nii. Third-party Complaints under Rule 14(a)\\nIf a required party under Rule 19(a) cannot be joined as a plaintiff or defendant, the court must determine whether under Rule 19(b) the action must be dismissed \"in equity and good conscience.\" Among the factors to be considered in making that determination is whether, under Rule 19(b)(2)(C), \"measures\" may be taken that would lessen or avoid any prejudice. To the degree that Peabody and the Nation may be prejudiced by the absence of the Secretary as a plaintiff or defendant, that prejudice may be eliminated by a third-party complaint against the Secretary under Rule 14(a).\\nThe courts of appeals that have addressed the question are unanimous in *1087 holding that if an absentee can be brought into an action by impleader under Rule 14(a), a dismissal under Rule 19(b) is inappropriate. In Pasco International (London) Ltd. v. Stenograph Corp., 637 F.2d 496 (2d Cir.1980), the Second Circuit repeatedly indicated that prejudice to existing parties could be eliminated by impleader under Rule 14(a). The court wrote, \"Stenograph can always protect itself from the possibility of inconsistent verdicts by impleading Croxford under Rule 14[.] ... [T]he existence of the Rule 14 provisions demonstrates that parties such as Croxford who may be impleaded under Rule 14 are not indispensable parties within Rule 19(b).\" Id. at 503. It summarized, \"[A]ll persons subject to impleader by the defendant are not indispensable parties. This is... merely an extension of the settled doctrine that Rule 19(b) was not intended to require the joinder of persons subject to impleader under Rule 14 such as potential indemnitors.\" Id. at 505 n. 20. The other circuits that have addressed the question have come to the same conclusion. See, e.g., Boone v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 682 F.2d 552, 553 (5th Cir.1982) (defendants \"could protect their interests by joining the dealer as a third party should they care to do so\"); Challenge Homes, Inc. v. Greater Naples Care Ctr., Inc., 669 F.2d 667, 671 (11th Cir.1982) (defendant \"may protect itself against [prejudice] by impleading [the absent person] under Rule 14\").\\n\\nc. Summary\\nWe conclude that prospective relief in the form of an injunction or declaratory judgment is available in a Rule 14(a) impleader against the Secretary. Such prospective relief against the Secretary is enough to protect Peabody and the Nation, both with respect to EEOC\\'s request for injunctive relief against Peabody and with respect to any res judicata effect against the Nation. Such relief would also protect the Secretary because, once brought in as a third-party defendant, he will be able to defend his position on the legality of the leases. We therefore conclude, \"in equity and good conscience,\" that EEOC\\'s claim against Peabody for injunctive relief should be allowed to proceed.\\n\\nC. Remaining Issues\\nEEOC has appealed the district court\\'s various other rulings, including its holding that the Navajo employment preference does not violate Title VII. We vacate all of these rulings to allow reconsideration once the Secretary has been brought into the suit as a third-party defendant. This will allow the court to consider the arguments of the Secretary on the legality of the employment preferences before issuing a final ruling. We note, further, that the presentation of the Secretary\\'s views in the district court, and the district court\\'s considered ruling taking those views into account, will be useful to us in the event of a further appeal.\\n\\nConclusion\\nWe again hold that joinder of the Navajo Nation under Rule 19 is feasible. We hold that the Secretary of the Interior is a party required to be joined if feasible under Rule 19(a), but that joinder of the Secretary as a defendant is not feasible. We hold that EEOC\\'s damages claim against Peabody must be dismissed under Rule 19(b). Finally, we hold that EEOC\\'s injunctive claim against Peabody should be allowed to proceed. We vacate the other rulings of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\nREVERSED in part and VACATED in part. Each party to bear its own costs.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  As of December 1, 2007, Rule 19 no longer refers to \"necessary\" or \"indispensable\" parties. Instead, it refers to \"persons required to be joined if feasible\" and persons in whose absence, if they cannot be joined, the action should not proceed.\\n\\nThe advisory committee notes indicate that the 2007 amendments to the civil rules were merely stylistic. With respect to Rule 19, they state:\\nThe language of Rule 19 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.\\nFormer Rule 19(b) described the conclusion that an action should be dismissed for inability to join a Rule 19(a) party by carrying forward traditional terminology: \"the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.\" \"Indispensable\" was used only to express a conclusion reached by applying the tests of Rule 19(b). It has been discarded as redundant.\\nFed.R.Civ.P. 19 advisory committee\\'s note (2007).\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 149223}]"},{"id":2599080,"date_filed":"2001-05-10","judges":"Marquez, Ney, Nieto","case_name_full":"Bashar LUTFI, M.D., Plaintiff-Appellant, v.

Grund, Denver CO; Kutak Rock, LLP, Melvin B. *54 Sabey, Denver, CO, for Defendants-Appellees.\\nOpinion by Judge MARQUEZ.\\nIn this dispute involving his removal from a schedule of physicians providing services in a hospital emergency medical service department (ER), plaintiff, Bashar Lutfi, M.D., appeals the summary judgment in favor of defendants, Platte Valley Medical Center, Inc. (the hospital), and John Hicks, the hospital\\'s chief executive officer. We affirm.\\nThe hospital contracted with Platte Valley Emergency Physicians, Inc. (PVEP), to provide physicians to cover the hospital\\'s ER. That contract contained a provision stating that the hospital could require PVEP to remove a physician from the ER. Plaintiff entered into an arrangement as an independent contractor with PVEP under which PVEP scheduled plaintiff to work in the ER.\\nWhile plaintiff was working in the ER, a patient with lacerated fingers came in. Although plaintiff denies it occurred, the patient claimed that plaintiff made him wait an inordinate amount of time for treatment, was rude to him, and finally refused him treatment. Subsequently, Hicks contacted PVEP and required, pursuant to the contract between the hospital and PVEP, that plaintiff be removed from the ER rotation.\\nAsserting racial and national origin discrimination, plaintiff brought this action alleging claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e (1994 &amp; 1998 Supp.), and also under \u00a7 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1994 &amp; 1998 Supp.). He also asserted claims for tortious interference with his employment agreement with PVEP, breach of agreement contained in the hospital\\'s bylaws, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, breach of employment contract, and promissory estoppel. Only the tortious interference and bylaws claims were asserted against Hicks. The trial court granted defendants\\' motion for summary judgment as to all of plaintiff\\'s claims for relief. This appeal followed.\\nSummary judgment is appropriate only when the pleadings and supporting documents demonstrate that no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Our review of an order granting or denying a motion for summary judgment is de novo. Aspen Wilderness Workshop, Inc. v. Colorado Water Conservation Board, 901 P.2d 1251 (Colo.1995). We conclude that the summary judgment was appropriate here.\\n\\nI. Title VII\\nPlaintiff first contends that the trial court erred in dismissing his national origin discrimination claim under Title VII on grounds that he was an independent contractor. He asserts that he need not establish a direct employer-employee relationship with the hospital to establish liability under Title VII, and that he is an employee for Title VII purposes. We are not persuaded.\\n\\nA. Title VII Does Not Apply to Independent Contractors\\nTitle VII provides, in pertinent part, that \"[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer \\x97 (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual ... because of such individual\\'s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a).\\nThere must, however, be some connection with an employment relationship for Title VII protections to apply. Thus, Title VII protects employees, but does not protect independent contractors. Adcock v. Chrysler Corp., 166 F.3d 1290 (9th Cir.1999). Under Title VII, \"employee\" is defined as \"an individual employed by an employer.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(f).\\nPlaintiff relies upon Sibley Memorial Hospital v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.Cir.1973), and other cases for the proposition that a nonemployee independent contractor may bring a claim under Title VII.\\nIn recent years, however, federal courts have almost uniformly ruled that a person who is an independent contractor cannot bring a Title VII claim. We find the reasoning of those decisions persuasive. See Schwieger v. Farm Bureau Insurance Co., 207 F.3d 480 (8th Cir.2000); Adcock v. *55 Chrysler Corp., supra; Zinn v. McKune, 143 F.3d 1353 (10th Cir.1998); Cilecek v. Inova Health System Services, 115 F.3d 256 (4th Cir.1997)(physician under contract to provide emergency medical services was an independent contractor rather than an employee and thus could not sustain a Title VII action); Alexander v. Rush N. Shore Medical Center, 101 F.3d 487 (7th Cir.1996)(physician could not bring a Title VII claim alleging the hospital\\'s revocation of his staff privileges constituted unlawful discrimination absent proof of an employment relationship, which did not exist because physician was independent contractor); Diggs v. Harris Hospital-Methodist, Inc., 847 F.2d 270 (5th Cir.1988)(no Title VII claim was proper because independent contractor physician failed to prove existence of an employment relationship with which hospital allegedly interfered); Cobb v. Sun Papers, Inc., 673 F.2d 337 (11th Cir.1982); Spirides v. Reinhardt, 613 F.2d 826 (D.C.Cir. 1979); Peck v. Democrat &amp; Chronicle\/Gannett Newspapers, 113 F. Supp. 2d 434 (W.D.N.Y.2000); Hannon v. Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., 107 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D.Mont.2000). See also 1 A. Larson &amp; L. Larson, Employment Discrimination \u00a7 5.22 (1991).\\nSome state courts also have recognized that Title VII applies to employees and not to independent contractors. See, e.g., Ostrander v. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co., 123 Idaho 650, 851 P.2d 946 (1993); Marquis v. City of Spokane, 130 Wash.2d 97, 922 P.2d 43 (1996).\\nFurther, the cases relied upon by plaintiff are distinguishable. In Sibley Memorial Hospital v. Wilson, supra, the court recognized that in a sex discrimination claim, even in the absence of an employment relationship, a hospital had brought itself within the strictures of Title VII by determining that a female patient should not have a male nurse and thus blocking access of a male private duty nurse to work for a female patient. In Christopher v. Stouder Memorial Hospital, 936 F.2d 870 (6th Cir.1991), a hospital refused to grant a nurse privileges to work in its facility as a private scrub nurse. Because the hospital had allegedly interfered with her access to employment, the nurse stated a claim under Title VII, even though she was not an employee. The court noted she was not an independent contractor with respect to the hospital. In Zaklama v. Mt. Sinai Medical Center, 842 F.2d 291 (11th Cir.1988), an anesthesiologist from Egypt was dismissed from a residency program based on adverse evaluations from a director of a training program and the hospital\\'s decision to bar him from the hospital. The hospital\\'s actions affected the plaintiff\\'s employment with an employer other than the defendant, and the plaintiff stated a claim under Title VII. In Pardazi v. Cullman Medical Center, 838 F.2d 1155 (11th Cir.1988), an Iran-educated medical practitioner was employed by a professional corporation, conditioned upon his becoming a member, with staff privileges, of the hospital. Although he was appointed to the hospital staff, his observation period was extended from four months to one year. Accepting that the plaintiff was not an employee, the court nonetheless concluded that the hospital could be held liable under Title VII if it interfered with the plaintiff\\'s employment opportunities with the professional corporation.\\nHowever, there is no indication in those cases of an agreement of the type between the hospital and PVEP requiring removal upon the hospital\\'s request. Here, the hospital acted in accordance with its contract with PVEP. Further, as discussed more fully below, the hospital\\'s action did not affect plaintiff\\'s employment status with PVEP, because plaintiff here was an independent contractor with respect to PVEP, not a PVEP employee. Additionally, those cases do not contradict the proposition that Title VII does not protect independent contractors. See, e.g., Spirides v. Reinhardt, supra (decision from the same circuit as Sibley Memorial Hospital v. Wilson, supra). Each of those cases is also distinguishable in that they involved defendants who were in a position to influence significantly the plaintiffs\\' respective employment opportunities. Here, by contrast, there is no evidence that the hospital interfered with plaintiff\\'s employment opportunities with other parties.\\n*56 We thus conclude that to prevail under Title VII, plaintiff must establish that he was not an independent contractor.\\n\\nB. Plaintiff Was an Independent Contractor\\nTo determine whether a person is an employee, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has concluded that the skeletal definitions of \"employer\" and \"employee\" provided in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e(b) and 2000e(f) should be fleshed out by applying common law agency principles to the facts and circumstances surrounding the working relationship of the parties. Although the main focus of this inquiry is whether and to what extent a putative employer has the right to control the means and manner of the worker\\'s performance, other factors inform the analysis, including:\\n(1) the kind of occupation at issue, with reference to whether the work usually is done under the direction of a supervisor or is done by a specialist without supervision; (2) the skill required in the particular occupation; (3) whether the employer or the employee furnishes the equipment used and the place of work; (4) the length of time the individual has worked; (5) the method of payment, whether by time or by job; (6) the manner in which the work relationship is terminated; (7) whether annual leave is afforded; (8) whether the work is an integral part of the business of the employer; (9) whether the worker accumulates retirement benefits; (10) whether the employer pays social security taxes; and (11) the intention of the parties.\\nZinn v. McKune, supra, 143 F.3d at 1357 (quoting Lambertsen v. Utah Department of Corrections, 79 F.3d 1024, 1028 (10th Cir. 1996)).\\nThe inquiry requires us to look to the totality of circumstances surrounding the working relationship between the parties; no single factor is determinative. Zinn v. McKune, supra.\\nHere, the contract between the hospital and PVEP expressly provides that \"nothing in this Agreement is intended nor shall be construed to create between Hospital and Contractor an employer\/employee relationship... or to allow Hospital to exercise control or direction over the manner or method by which the Physicians provide professional medical services at Hospital.\" This leaves no question as to the intent of the parties that no employee-employer relationship would be formed and that the hospital would have no control over the \"means and manner\" of plaintiff\\'s ER work.\\nPlaintiff was also an independent contractor in relation to PVEP. This is shown in an agreement with PVEP, which plaintiff signed, that stated that all \"physicians are independent contractors.\"\\nIn addition, plaintiff had signed an agreement regarding his medical staff privileges with the hospital in which he \"expressly acknowledged... that [he] is an `independent contractor\\' with respect to Hospital and nothing in this Agreement ... shall be construed to create ... an employer\/employee relationship.\"\\nAccording to the evidence submitted by defendants, PVEP provided plaintiff, a licensed professional physician, with his work assignments and scheduling at the hospital. In contrast, the hospital did not directly hire plaintiff for ER assignments and could not fire plaintiff from PVEP. If the hospital was not satisfied with a PVEP employee, its only option was to contact PVEP and require that that person be removed from the ER. Further, according to PVEP\\'s agreement with the hospital, the hospital paid PVEP for plaintiff\\'s services, and PVEP paid plaintiff for services rendered in the ER.\\nThe physician who incorporated PVEP and executed its agreement with the hospital stated in his deposition that the memorandum executed by plaintiff was intended \"to remind [the physicians] that they were independent contractors.\" Plaintiff\\'s own expert witness also stated that \"[plaintiff] was not an employee of the hospital.\"\\nIn response, plaintiff emphasized portions of the agreement between PVEP and the hospital, arguing that these provisions established the hospital\\'s control over ER physicians and that the hospital agreed to provide office space, furniture, and equipment. However, read in context, those provisions do not *57 support an employment relationship. We thus conclude as a matter of law that plaintiff was an independent contractor.\\nOur conclusion is consistent with the \"corporate practice of medicine\" doctrine articulated by the supreme court in the context of respondeat superior. Under that doctrine, a corporation such as a hospital cannot be licensed to practice medicine and thus cannot command or forbid any act by a doctor in the practice of medicine. Its relationship with a doctor providing medical services is necessarily that of an independent contractor. Moon v. Mercy Hospital, 150 Colo. 430, 373 P.2d 944 (1962); Nieto v. State, 952 P.2d 834 (Colo.App.1997), rev\\'d on other grounds, 993 P.2d 493 (Colo.2000).\\nThe one exception to the doctrine, which applies to physician-formed professional services corporations, is not relevant here because the hospital is not such a corporation. See generally \u00a7 12-36-134, C.R.S.2000; Russell v. Pediatric Neurosurgery, P.C., 15 P.3d 288 (Colo.App.2000)(cert. granted December 18, 2000).\\nAccordingly, the trial court correctly granted summary judgment on plaintiff\\'s Title VII claim.\\n\\nII. Section 1981\\nPlaintiff next contends that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 does not require proof that he was an \"employee,\" as defined in Title VII, and that the trial court erred in failing to consider the implications of the hospital bylaws, which plaintiff alleges constituted a contract between plaintiff and the hospital, giving grounds for a \u00a7 1981 claim. We disagree.\\nUnder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(a), \"[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State ... to make and enforce contracts,\" which includes the \"making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(b).\\nWhen \u00a7 1981 and Title VII claims arise from identical facts, the elements of each claim are construed in the same way. Gwin v. Chesrown Chevrolet, Inc., 931 P.2d 466 (Colo.App.1996) (citing Skinner v. Total Petroleum, Inc., 859 F.2d 1439 (10th Cir. 1988)).\\nTherefore, because plaintiff\\'s Title VII claim fails due to his independent contractor status, his \u00a7 1981 claim fails as well. See O\\'Neal v. Ferguson Construction Co., 237 F.3d 1248 (10th Cir.2001)(both Title VII and \u00a7 1981 require a plaintiff to establish the same prima facie elements); Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 232 F.3d 836 (11th Cir.2000)(elements of a claim of race discrimination under \u00a7 1981 are the same as those for a Title VII disparate treatment claim in the employment context); Johnson v. University of Cincinnati, 215 F.3d 561 (6th Cir.2000)(elements are the same for employment cases stemming from \u00a7 1981 and Title VII); Vakharia v. Swedish Covenant Hospital, 190 F.3d 799 (7th Cir.1999).\\nPlaintiff, however, contends that he has a contractual relationship with the hospital based upon its bylaws. He claims this is sufficient to give rise to a \u00a7 1981 claim independent of an employee-employer relationship. We disagree.\\nSection 1981 prohibits discriminatory conduct that occurs both before and after the establishment of the contractual relationship. See Perry v. Woodward, 199 F.3d 1126 (10th Cir.1999)(\u00a7 1981 centers on the protection of contractual rights; any claim brought pursuant to \u00a7 1981 must be supported by an underlying right of the employee to make and enforce contracts).\\nAn employer\\'s distribution to an employee of documents that contain specific procedures for termination of employment, when relied upon by an employee and supported by the consideration of continued employment, may result in the employer becoming contractually bound to comply with those procedures. See Continental Air Lines, Inc. v. Keenan, 731 P.2d 708 (Colo.1987); Ferrera v. Nielsen, 799 P.2d 458 (Colo.App.1990).\\nHere, the hospital\\'s bylaws, under the capitalized heading \"PURPOSE AND USE OF MEDICAL STAFF BYLAWS,\" contain the following disclaimer:\\n\\n*58 These Medical Staff Bylaws and the Rules and Regulations do not constitute a contract of any kind whatsoever and any Practitioner who intends that these Bylaws and the Rules and Regulations should constitute a contract must first notify the Hospital and obtain the written consent of the Board. These Bylaws and the Rules and Regulations shall be interpreted, applied and enforced within the sole discretion of the Hospital. (emphasis added)\\nPlaintiff presented no evidence that he attempted to notify the hospital of his intent to rely upon the bylaws as a contract. Nor is there evidence that he obtained the requisite consent of the board to do so. Thus, the bylaws did not create a contractual relationship between plaintiff and the hospital.\\nTherefore, plaintiff\\'s \u00a7 1981 claim also fails under his theory that the bylaws created such a relationship.\\n\\nIII. Tortious Interference\\nPlaintiff next contends that Hicks, in directing PVEP to remove plaintiff from the ER rotation, tortiously interfered with his contract with PVEP. We are not persuaded.\\nTo establish tortious interference with a contract requires that: (1) the plaintiff had a contract with another party; (2) the defendant knew or should have known of such contract\\'s existence; (3) the defendant intentionally induced the other party to the contract not to perform the contract with the plaintiff; and (4) the defendant\\'s actions caused the plaintiff to incur damages. Telluride Real Estate Co. v. Penthouse Affiliates, LLC, 996 P.2d 151 (Colo.App.1999).\\nRegarding the third element, the interference with a prospective business relationship must be both intentional and improper. Amoco Oil Co. v. Ervin, 908 P.2d 493 (Colo.1995).\\nHere, even if plaintiff established the first and second elements of his claim, he provided no evidentiary support for the third element, intentional and improper action by Hicks.\\nThe record reveals that Hicks directed PVEP to remove plaintiff from the emergency room rotation. However, the agreement between the hospital and PVEP states, in pertinent part, that the \"Hospital may at any time, require Contractor [PVEP] to remove any of the individual Physicians from the Department coverage schedule.\" Thus, the hospital, through Hicks, acted properly in exercising its rights under the agreement.\\nFurther, nothing in plaintiff\\'s agreement with PVEP specifically precluded his removal from the ER rotation. His contract addressed only compensation, holidays, weekends, vacations, and time off.\\nTherefore, because plaintiff presented no evidence to establish improper action by Hicks, we conclude that the trial court properly entered summary judgment on this claim as well.\\n\\nIV. Breach of Contract\\nWe also reject plaintiff\\'s contention that the hospital breached its contract with him by failing to afford him the benefits and protections of its bylaws.\\nAs noted above, the bylaws did not create a contractual relationship between plaintiff and the hospital. However, even if the bylaws were contractually binding upon the hospital, the protective provisions of the bylaws upon which plaintiff relies do not apply here. The procedural rights in the bylaws, which relate to physicians whose right to practice medicine the hospital denies, removes, or restricts, were not implicated by defendants\\' actions. Plaintiff\\'s removal from the ER had \"no effect on [plaintiff\\'s] appointment status or clinical privileges\" at the hospital.\\nThe procedural rights contained in the bylaws apply only to an adverse recommendation, after investigation by the Medical Executive Committee (MEC), rather than to an action taken by the hospital\\'s chief executive officer pursuant to an outside contract. Hicks\\' actions in the present case were exclusively controlled by the terms of the contract between the hospital and PVEP, not hospital bylaws.\\n\\n\\n*59 V. Good Faith and Fair Dealing\\nPlaintiff further contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. We are not persuaded.\\nEvery contract contains an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. However, this implied duty may be relied upon only when the manner of performance under a specific contract term allows for discretion on the part of either party; it may not contradict terms or conditions for which the parties have bargained. Amoco Oil Co. v. Ervin, supra.\\nIf a claim based on the violation of an express covenant of good faith is to be recognized, such a claim is a contractual one. Hoyt v. Target Stores, 981 P.2d 188 (Colo. App.1998).\\nHere, there was no contract, express or implied, between plaintiff and the hospital concerning his work in the ER. Therefore, no claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing may stand. See Hoyt v. Target Stores, supra.\\nFurther, plaintiff\\'s relationship with the hospital as an ER physician was based solely on the agreement between the hospital and PVEP. As discussed above, that document expressly sets forth the hospital\\'s right to require PVEP to remove a physician from the ER schedule. Consequently, plaintiff cannot rely on the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing to circumvent terms for which PVEP and the hospital expressly bargained. See generally Grossman v. Columbine Medical Group, 12 P.3d 269 (Colo.App.1999)(covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot limit an independent practice association\\'s right to discharge an independent contractor, where terms for which independent contractor and association bargained allowed such removal).\\nTherefore, we conclude that summary judgment for the defendants was proper on this claim.\\n\\nVI. Promissory Estoppel\\nFinally, we are not persuaded by plaintiff\\'s contention that the trial court erred in dismissing his claim for promissory estoppel based upon his reliance on the hospital\\'s bylaws.\\nUnder Colorado law, the elements of a promissory estoppel claim are: (1) the promisor made a promise to the promisee; (2) the promisor should reasonably have expected that the promise would induce action or forbearance by the promisee; (3) the promisee reasonably relied on the promise to the promisee\\'s detriment; and (4) the promise must be enforced to prevent injustice. Berg v. State Board of Agriculture, 919 P.2d 254 (Colo.1996).\\nHere, plaintiff claims on appeal that he agreed to close his internal medicine practice based on his understanding that the hospital bylaws would protect him from indiscriminate termination from the ER. While plaintiff cites portions of the record in support of his claim, he points to nothing in the record that indicates his reliance upon the hospital\\'s bylaws. The record indicates that it was not until after he lost his ER position that he looked to the bylaws to see if they contained provisions on physician removal that might strengthen his claim against the hospital. See Brighton School District 27J v. Transamerica Premier Insurance Co., 923 P.2d 328 (Colo.App.1996)(it is not the duty of the reviewing court to search the record for evidence to support bald assertions).\\nFurther, if an employee seeks to rely upon a written policy of the employer as the basis for a promissory estoppel claim, that employee must accept the whole of that policy. The employee may not reject those portions of the policy that may be considered unfavorable. Floyd v. Coors Brewing Co., 952 P.2d 797 (Colo.App.1997), rev\\'d on other grounds, 978 P.2d 663 (Colo.1999).\\nHere, even if plaintiff had relied upon the bylaws, as noted above, they offer protection only under certain circumstances not present in plaintiff\\'s situation, i.e., \"an adverse recommendation\" by the MEC.\\nAccordingly, the judgment is affirmed.\\nNEY and NIETO, JJ., concur.\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 2599080}]"},{"id":2596640,"date_filed":"1996-05-08","judges":"Kay","case_name_full":"Jeffrey M.

Ellison, formerly an aircraft mechanic employed by defendant Northwest Airlines, Inc. (\"Northwest\"), filed a complaint against defendants Northwest and Wendell A. Nelson, his direct supervisor at Northwest (collectively, \"Defendants\"), alleging harassment, discrimination and wrongful termination.\\nOn January 22, 1996, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On April 18, 1996, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On May 6, 1996, the Court heard Defendants\\' motion. All parties appeared through counsel. Upon considering the papers filed by the parties, the arguments at the hearing, and the record, the Court hereby GRANTS Defendants\\' motion for summary judgment.\\n\\nFACTS\\nIn 1981, plaintiff Ellison began working as an aircraft mechanic for defendant Northwest at its Minneapolis facility. In 1988, Plaintiff transferred to Northwest\\'s Honolulu facility, where he worked on the flight line as an aircraft mechanic until July 17, 1992. On that day, according to the affidavit of Plaintiff\\'s supervisor at that time Wendell Nelson, Nelson suspended Plaintiff and sent him home because of insubordinate conduct, use of abusive language towards Nelson and Plaintiff\\'s crew chief Danny Marcom, and conduct that day which otherwise interfered with the performance of other employees.\\nNelson scheduled an insubordination meeting with Plaintiff to take place July 20, 1992. Plaintiff however failed to appear for this meeting, allegedly because he was experiencing an emotional breakdown at the time and could not do so. Ellison Affid. at \u00b6 11. Nelson then rescheduled the meeting for July 27, 1992 and sent Plaintiff a notice to this effect by certified mail.\\nOn July 23, 1992, Plaintiff was taken to the emergency room at Queen\\'s Medical Center and admitted for treatment in the psychiatric ward under the care of Dr. Mutsuoki Kai. Plaintiff stayed there for 8 days.\\nOn July 27, 1992, Plaintiff failed to appear for the rescheduled meeting. Instead, union representative Danny Chong gave Nelson a letter dated July 24, 1992 from Dr. Harry Chingon, writing for Dr. Mutsuoki Kai, stating that Plaintiff was under the care of Dr. Kai and could not attend the meeting on July 27, 1992. See Plaintiff\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. 15 (letter dated July 24, 1992).\\nAlso on July 27, 1992, Nelson sent Plaintiff (1) a notice entitled \"Level 2 Reminder \\x97 Insubordination,\" reminding Plaintiff he already had an active level 1 reminder on file for insubordination and cautioning him to modify his behavior; and (2) a notice entitled \"Medical Statement\" informing Plaintiff that *1505 \"[i]n order to return to active employment with Northwest Airlines, your physician must sign a statement acknowledging you have fully recovered from your illness\" and that \"[u]ntil that time, ... you will be compensated for medical leave.\" Plaintiffs Concise Stmt., Exhs. 16 (level 2 reminder) and 17 (notice re medical statement).\\nOn August 7, 1992, Nelson received a letter dated July 30, 1992 from Dr. Kai, stating in relevant part as follows:\\n[Plaintiff] has been at Queen\\'s Medical Center under my care from July 24 to this morning. Diagnosis is 1. Adjustment Disorder with mixed emotional disturbances due to stresses at his job, 2. Chronic Dyspepsia, 3. Hypothyroidism.\\nYesterday he had an endoscopy by Gerald Hyatt, M.D., re: his so called stomach ulcer or a chronic dyspepsia.\\nHe will be followed by George Seberg, M.D. his internist.\\nHe will see a psychiatrist of his choice.\\nHe will return to his job on Monday, August 3rd. The above statement is almost exactly identical with my hand-written letter addressed to you that I handed to him this morning.\\nNow I would like to add that he had some predischarge anxiety after he finished talking with me. As he was anxious about his return to the job on Monday, I suggested him to consult his future psychiatrist quickly about it.\\nDefendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. A.\\nUpon his release from Queen\\'s Medical Center, Plaintiff sought the assistance of Dr. Alvin Murphy, who, on July 31, 1992, issued a note stating: \"To Whom it May Concern ... [Plaintiff] is seen for the first time today. He is clearly disabled and unable to work. The period of disability is unclear at present.\" Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. C. According to his affidavit, Nelson did not receive a copy of this note or know of Plaintiff\\'s diagnosis as \"disabled and unable to work\" until August 25, 1992, at the first step grievance hearing on Plaintiff\\'s termination on August 12, 1992. Nelson Affid. at \u00b6 7. Plaintiff does not claim he communicated the contents of the note to Defendants prior to August 25, 1992.\\nBy \"Notice of Discharge\" dated August 12, 1992, Nelson advised Plaintiff that he was terminated as of 8:00 a.m. that day. Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. B. The Notice states that the discharge was based on (1) the July 17, 1992 incident of insubordination; (2) Plaintiffs failure to appear for the July 27, 1992 rescheduled meeting and to contact Nelson since;[1] and (3) Plaintiff\\'s failure to report for his scheduled work shift since August 3, 1992. See id. Nelson states in his affidavit that he \"believed Ellison had no valid reason for not appearing for work, since Dr. Kai\\'s letter [which was dated July 30, 1992 but allegedly not received by Nelson until August 7, 1992] stated that [Plaintiff] would be able to return to work on August 3, 1992.\" Nelson Affid. at \u00b6 6.\\nEllison\\'s August 12, 1992 termination was grieved by his union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, under its collective bargaining agreement with Northwest. Plaintiff was represented during this grievance process by union representatives Nan Otto and Danny Marcom. See Defendants\\' Reply, Exh. A (Ellison Depo.) at 297-98. On or about March 30, 1993, Plaintiff wrote Timothy Mahoney, in house labor counsel for Northwest, stating that he \"would like to meet with [Mahoney] to discuss [his] termination and disability, and to be placed back on active status under the Americans With Disabilities Act.\" Defendants\\' Concise Stmt. at \u00b6 9.\\nOn or about April 8, 1993, Mahoney replied to Plaintiff, stating that because Plaintiffs termination from Northwest was \"not related to any disability,\" Northwest was under no obligation to reinstate his employment. Defendants\\' Concise Stmt. at 10.\\nOn April 20-21, 1993 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, an arbitration hearing on Plaintiff\\'s *1506 grievance was held before the System Board of Adjustment (\"SBA\").\\nOn June 7, 1993, Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, filed a charge of discrimination against Northwest with the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission and the Honolulu office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), alleging discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"). Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. G. The charge does not name Wendell Nelson as a respondent. Id.\\nOn October 3, 1993, the SBA rendered its Opinion and Award regarding Plaintiffs union grievance, finding that (1) the Level 2 Reminder dated July 27, 1992 was issued for just cause; but (2) Plaintiff\\'s discharge was not for just cause. Plaintiff\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. 9 (opinion and award) at 23. The SBA ordered that Plaintiff be reinstated without backpay conditioned on a favorable fitness evaluation. Plaintiff\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. 9 (opinion and award) at 23. The SBA ordered that Plaintiff undergo a fitness for duty evaluation by a physician designated by Northwest. Id. Plaintiff could also designate his own physician to conduct an evaluation. If the physicians\\' evaluations disagreed, the parties were instructed to agree on a third physician, whose evaluation would be final and binding. Id. If Plaintiff finally was found unfit for service, he would be placed on unpaid medical leave for 90 days. If at the end of that period Plaintiff still had not been certified as fit for service, he would be terminated and such termination would be deemed for just cause. Id. at 24.\\nAs a result of the SBA\\'s decision, Nelson wrote Plaintiff on October 19, 1993 and informed him that evaluations with Dr. Charles Hipp and Dr. Hung had been scheduled for November 19, 1993. Plaintiff\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. 10. By letter dated December 9, 1993, Dr. Hipp wrote Timothy Caskey, manager of labor relations for Northwest, stating: \"Both Dr. Hung and I feel that Mr. Ellison is not capable of working as an aircraft mechanic due to his underlying medical problem and functional limitations. It is unlikely he will be able to return to work as an aircraft mechanic in the foreseeable future.\" Plaintiffs Concise Stmt., Exh. 11. On December 16, 1993, therefore, Timothy Mahoney, labor counsel for Northwest, wrote Nan Otto, general chairwoman of Plaintiff\\'s union, and informed her that Plaintiff would be placed on 90-day medical leave to expire March 15, 1994, at which time he would be terminated and such termination would be deemed for just cause. Plaintiff\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. 12. At the expiration of this period, by letter dated March 18, 1994, Nelson informed Plaintiff that pursuant to the SBA decision, Plaintiff was terminated effective March 15, 1994. Plaintiff\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. 13.\\nIn addition to pursuing his union grievance, Plaintiff was also pursuing a workers\\' compensation claim, in which he was represented by attorney Lowell Chun-Hoon. Defendants\\' Reply, Exh. A (Ellison Depo.) at 16:9-11. On November 30, 1993, Plaintiff received a favorable workers\\' compensation award against Northwest from the Hawaii Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. Plaintiff\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. 7 (award).\\nAt around this time, Plaintiff was also pursuing medical negligence claims against Queen\\'s Medical Center and Dr. Mutsuoki Kai, in which he was represented by attorney Robert Merce, who had been recommended to Plaintiff by Lowell-Chun Hoon. See Defendants\\' Reply at 4; Ellison Depo. at 61:14-62:19. According to Defendants, Plaintiff\\'s original claims were filed by Merce on Plaintiff\\'s behalf on October 14, 1993. See Defendants\\' Reply at 4. The case then proceeded to a hearing on December 21, 1993 before the Medical Claims Conciliation Panel (\"MCCP\"), which resulted in a decision from the MCCP dated December 29, 1993 finding no negligence on the part of Queen\\'s Medical Center but negligence on the part of Dr. Kai. Defendants\\' Reply, Exh. A, Ellison Depo., Exh. 2 (MCCP decision). After some settlement negotiations, Plaintiff, with some help from Merce by way of a memorandum with instructions dated July 21, 1994, filed suit against Queen\\'s Medical Center and Dr. Kai. See Defendants\\' Reply at 4; Ellison Depo. at 289:1-23; Ellison Depo., Exh. 1 (July 21, 1994 memorandum from Merce).\\n*1507 According to his affidavit, Plaintiff began receiving workers\\' compensation benefits in November 1993, at which time he started renting a room at 505 Kao\\'opulu Way in Hawaii Kai. Ellison Affid. at \u00b6 24. Sometime later that month, Plaintiff moved from that address and obtained a new post office box address at P.O. Box 25852, Honolulu, HI 96825. Ellison Affid. at \u00b6 25; Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. J at Interrogatory No. 2. Plaintiff alleges that sometime in November 1993, he called the EEOC Honolulu office and gave it his new telephone number and post office box address. Ellison Affid. at \u00b6 25; see also Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. H (EEOC log with 11\/9\/93 entry stating \"CP [charging party] called to discuss NRTS [presumably notice of right to sue] &amp; new phone no.\").\\nBy letter dated December 13, 1993, Plaintiff wrote to the EEOC and requested a right to sue letter, stating \"I intend to file suit in Federal Court.\" Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. I. By letter dated December 14, 1993, the EEOC wrote Plaintiff, stating that it appeared its investigation was complete and that the investigation had uncovered no evidence Northwest knew Plaintiff had a disability or considered him as having a disability when it discharged him on August 12, 1992. The EEOC invited Plaintiff to submit within 10 days any further arguments or evidence he wished EEOC to consider before issuing its Letter of Determination. Plaintiff\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. 1. This December 14, 1993 letter was addressed to Plaintiff\\'s new post office box address. Id.\\nBy letter dated December 27, 1993, the EEOC issued its Determination, which found that \"the evidence obtained during the investigation does not establish a violation of the [ADA]\" and which informed Plaintiff he had to file suit within 90 days. Plaintiff\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. 2.\\nThis December 27, 1993 Determination was mailed by EEOC not to Plaintiff\\'s new post office box address, however, but to his former address at \"505 Kao\\'opulu Way, Honolulu, HI 96825.\" Plaintiff\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. 2. The Determination was then forwarded by the post office on either January 3 or 4, 1994 to Plaintiffs correct post office box address. See Defendant\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. J at Exh. A (certified, postmarked and forwarded envelope produced by Plaintiff). In response to Defendants\\' request for admissions, Plaintiff admits he received the December 27, 1993 Determination but states: \"I do not recall the exact date that I received such letter given my mental condition at that time.\" Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. J at Request for Admission No. 2.\\nAccording to Plaintiff, sometime in August 1994, he called the EEOC office to inquire about the status of his complaint and was informed that a right to sue letter had been sent several months earlier. Ellison Affid. at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Plaintiff then requested that another right to sue letter be issued. Id. at \u00b6 29. The EEOC mailed this second right to sue letter on August 26, 1994. See Plaintiff\\'s Memo. in Opp. at 4. Plaintiff filed the instant suit on November 23, 1994, eighty-nine days after August 26, 1994.\\nAt the present time, Plaintiff is still being treated by Dr. Alvin Murphy and is still receiving workers\\' compensation benefits. Ellison Affid. at \u00b6 33.\\n\\nSUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\\nSummary judgment shall be granted where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). One of the principal purposes of the summary judgment procedure is to identify and dispose of factually unsupported claims and defenses. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552-53, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).\\nThe United States Supreme Court has declared that summary judgment must be granted against a party who fails to demonstrate facts to establish an element essential to his case where that party will bear the burden of proof of that essential element at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S. Ct. at 2552. \"If the party moving for summary judgment meets its initial burden of identifying for the court the portions of the materials on file that it believes demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact [citations omitted], the nonmoving party may *1508 not rely on the mere allegations in the pleadings in order to preclude summary judgment.\" T.W. Elec. Serv. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass\\'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir.1987).\\nRather, Rule 56(e) requires that the nonmoving party set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. T.W. Elec. Serv., 809 F.2d at 630. At least some \"significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint\" must be produced. Id. Legal memoranda and oral argument are not evidence and do not create issues of fact capable of defeating an otherwise valid motion for summary judgment. British Airways Bd. v. Boeing Co., 585 F.2d 946, 952 (9th Cir.1978).\\nThe standard for a grant of summary judgment reflects the standard governing the grant of a directed verdict. See Eisenberg v. Ins. Co. of North America, 815 F.2d 1285, 1289 (9th Cir.1987) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). Thus, the question is whether \"reasonable minds could differ as to the import of the evidence.\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250-51, 106 S. Ct. at 2511.\\nThe Ninth Circuit has established that \"[n]o longer can it be argued that any disagreement about a material issue of fact precludes the use of summary judgment.\" California Architectural Bldg. Products, Inc. v. Franciscan Ceramics, Inc., 818 F.2d 1466, 1468 (9th Cir.1987). Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has stated that \"[w]hen the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56(c), its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).\\nIndeed, \"if the factual context makes the nonmoving party\\'s claim implausible, that party must come forward with more persuasive evidence than would otherwise be necessary to show that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Franciscan Ceramics, 818 F.2d at 1468 (emphasis in original) (citing Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S. Ct. at 1356). Of course, all evidence and inferences to be drawn therefrom must be construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. T.W. Elec. Serv., 809 F.2d at 630-31.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nAlthough not entirely clear, Plaintiff appears to make the following claims: (1) violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 et seq., based on (a) Defendants\\' August 12, 1992 termination of Plaintiff allegedly with knowledge of his disability and (b) Defendants\\' refusal to meet with Plaintiff in response to his March 30, 1993 letter requesting a meeting to discuss possible reinstatement and \"reasonable accommodation;\" (2) wrongful termination of employment while on medical leave for occupational injury; (3) negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress as a result of his harassment at work; and (4) retaliatory discharge based on Plaintiff\\'s refusal to violate Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") regulations regarding airplane maintenance and clearance procedures. See Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. J at Request for Admission No. 1 and Interrogatory No. 1; see also id., Exh. G (Plaintiff\\'s EEOC charge); Mahoney Affid. at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 (rejecting Plaintiff\\'s March 30, 1993 request for meeting); Plaintiff\\'s Opp. at 12-13 (violation of ADA based thereon).\\n\\nI. ADA\\n\\nDefendants argue that Plaintiff\\'s ADA claim is barred because he failed to file suit within the applicable 90 day period and because he is not entitled to equitable tolling. The Court agrees.\\n\\nA. 90 Day Filing Requirement\\n\\nThe ADA incorporates the complaint filing procedures set forth in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). Title VII provides that an action must be filed within 90 days of the \"giving of ... notice\" of the EEOC\\'s dismissal of a claimant\\'s charge. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). This 90 day filing requirement constitutes a statute of limitations. Scholar v. Pacific Bell, 963 F.2d 264, 267 (9th Cir.1992); Edwards *1509 v. Occidental Chem. Corp., 892 F.2d 1442, 1445 (9th Cir.1990).\\nHere, the EEOC\\'s Determination and right to sue letter dated December 27, 1993 was mailed on December 28, 1993 by certified mail to Plaintiff at his old address at \"505 Kao\\'opulu Way.\" Defendant\\'s Concise Stmt., Exh. J at Exh. A (certified, postmarked and forwarded envelope containing December 27, 1993 Determination, produced by Plaintiff). The Determination was then forwarded on either January 3 or 4, 1994, to Plaintiffs new post office box address at \"P.O. Box 25852, Honolulu, HI XXXXX-XXXX.\" Id.\\nPlaintiff admits receiving the forwarded Determination but claims he cannot recall when. See Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. J at Request for Admission No. 2. Plaintiff\\'s complaint was filed November 23, 1994, over 10 months after the Determination was forwarded to Plaintiff\\'s post office box address. The question presented is whether it should be presumed that Plaintiff received the Determination a certain number of days after forwarding.\\nIn similar situations where the date of receipt of a right to sue letter has been uncertain, courts have applied a presumption of receipt within a certain number of days after mailing, including 3, 5 or 7 days. See, e.g., Baldwin County Welcome Ctr. v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 148 n. 1, 104 S. Ct. 1723, 1724 n. 1, 80 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1984) (presumed date of receipt of right to sue letter was 3 days after issuance, based on Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(e)); Pacheco v. Int\\'l Business Machines Corp., 1991 WL 87538, *3-4 (N.D.N.Y.1991) (same); Rich v. Bob Downes Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 831 F. Supp. 733, 735 (E.D.Mo.1993) (same); Stambaugh v. Kansas Dept. of Corrections, 844 F. Supp. 1431, 1433 (D.Kan. 1994) (same, 3 day receipt presumption triggered by right to sue letter being mailed and by the fact that date of actual receipt \"is either unknown or in dispute\"); Hunter v. Stephenson Roofing, Inc., 790 F.2d 472, 475 (6th Cir.1986) (applying 5 day presumption where claimant failed to notify EEOC of change of address, citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.210(c) (1985) (presumption that social security claimant receives notice of right to sue 5 days after notice first enters mail)); Banks v. Rockwell Int\\'l North American Aircraft Operations, 666 F. Supp. 1053, 1059 (S.D.Ohio 1987) (same, citing Hunter), aff\\'d, 855 F.2d 324 (6th Cir.1988); Witt v. Roadway Express, 880 F. Supp. 1455, 1461 (D.Kan. 1995) (applying 5 day presumption); Roush v. Kartridge Pak Co., 838 F. Supp. 1328, 1335 (S.D.Iowa 1993) (applying 7 day presumption, suggested by defendants, as reasonable period of time); McNeill v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., 878 F. Supp. 986, 990 (S.D.Tex.1995) (applying 7 day presumption as reasonable, citing Roush).\\nThe Court first finds that here, where the December 17, 1993 Determination was forwarded to Plaintiff\\'s correct address and where Plaintiff admits having received the Determination, a presumption of receipt within some reasonable time properly applies. The Court need not decide however whether 3, 5 or 7 days is the appropriate period of time, although it finds that the appropriate period should be no greater than 7 days. Even applying a 7 day presumption to a forwarding date of January 4, 1994 yields at the latest a presumptive receipt date of January 11, 1994, which is much more than 90 days prior to the filing of Plaintiff\\'s complaint on November 23, 1994. For purposes of this motion, therefore, the Court will apply a presumptive receipt date of January 11, 1994.\\nThe Court further finds that the January 11, 1994 presumptive receipt date is unrebutted, whether by any evidence of nonreceipt (in fact, Plaintiff admits he received the Determination) or by any evidence of receipt on any other day within 90 days of initiation of the present action. See Roush v. Kartridge Pak Co., 838 F. Supp. 1328, 1335 (S.D.Iowa 1993) (granting summary judgment despite lack of any evidence as to whether plaintiff received EEOC right to sue letter on the basis she \"has failed to ... generate a material question of fact as to whether she received the [letter]\" and defendant is entitled to rely on presumption of receipt); Rich v. Bob Downes Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 831 F. Supp. 733, 735 (E.D.Mo.1993) (\"Particularly when considering the presumption that Rich received the *1510 notice three days after its mailing, Rich has not shown that a genuine issue exists as to whether he received the notice within ninety days of initiating this action.\"); Witt v. Roadway Express, 880 F. Supp. 1455, 1461 (D.Kan. 1995) (invoking 5 day presumption of receipt where \"[p]laintiff has not presented any evidence to rebut the presumption or to establish the actual receipt date\"); see also Stambaugh v. Kansas Dept. of Corrections, 844 F. Supp. 1431, 1433 (D.Kan.1994) (\"plaintiff is in the best position to know and prove whether the right-to-sue letter was actually received\"); see also T.W. Elec. Serv. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass\\'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir.1987) (plaintiff must produce at least some \"significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint\").\\nThe Court accordingly finds that Plaintiff\\'s complaint was filed outside the applicable 90 day period and therefore is barred as untimely \\x97 unless equitable tolling applies.\\n\\nB. Equitable Tolling\\n\\nThe Ninth Circuit has held that the 90 day filing requirement is subject to equitable tolling, although the doctrine is available only in \"extreme cases\" and is to be applied \"sparingly.\" Scholar v. Pacific Bell, 963 F.2d 264, 267 (9th Cir.1992); see also Irwin v. Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 457-458, 112 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1990) (\"Federal courts have typically extended equitable relief only sparingly. We have allowed equitable tolling in situations where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary\\'s misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass. We have generally been much less forgiving in receiving late filings where the claimant failed to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights.\") (footnotes omitted) (quoted in part in Scholar).\\nPlaintiff argues that equitable tolling ought to apply here on account of his \"severe mental condition.\" Plaintiff\\'s Opp. at 4. The Court does not concur. Preliminarily, the Court notes that Plaintiff does not present one of the situations set forth in Irwin: he neither filed a timely though defective pleading during the 90 day period nor was he tricked by Northwest into allowing the deadline to pass.\\nIn addition, even assuming mental incapacity can toll the 90 day period, see, e.g., Scott v. United States, 847 F. Supp. 1499 (D.Haw. 1993), aff\\'d, 70 F.3d 120 (9th Cir.1995), the Court finds there is no genuine issue of equitable tolling by reason of mental incapacity here. First, it is clear, as Defendants point out in their reply, that during the period from August 12, 1992, the date of Plaintiff\\'s complained of termination, to January 11, 1994, the presumptive receipt date of the EEOC\\'s Determination and right to sue letter, Plaintiff was not mentally incapacitated with respect to being able to manage his legal affairs.\\nSecond, according to the affidavit of Plaintiff\\'s doctor, Dr. Alvin Murphy, Plaintiff\\'s condition in fact generally improved after January 11, 1994. Moreover, although Dr. Murphy states repeatedly that Plaintiff is disabled and cannot work, at no time does he state that Plaintiff was mentally incapacitated to the point of being unable to deal with his legal affairs. Accordingly, at least during the 90 day period following January 11, 1994, the Court finds there is no genuine issue of equitable tolling by reason of mental incapacity.\\n\\n1. August 12, 1992 through January 11, 1994\\n\\nDuring the period from August 12, 1992 through January 11, 1994, Plaintiff clearly was not mentally incapacitated to the point of being unable to deal with his legal affairs. During this period, Plaintiff pursued his union grievance against Northwest with the help of union representatives Nan Otto and Danny Marcom. See Ellison Depo. at 297-98. Plaintiff also pursued his workers\\' compensation claims with the help of attorney Lowell Chun-Hoon. Defendants\\' Reply, Exh. A (Ellison Depo.) at 16:9-11. Plaintiff also pursued his medical negligence claims against Queen\\'s Medical Center and Dr. Mutsuoki Kai with the help of attorney Robert Merce. See Defendants\\' Reply at 4; Ellison Depo. at 61:14-62:19. After attending *1511 a hearing on December 21, 1993 before the Medical Claims Conciliation Panel, Plaintiff subsequently filed suit against Queen\\'s and Dr. Kai. Defendants\\' Reply, Exh. A, Ellison Depo., Exh. 2 (MCCP decision); Defendants\\' Reply at 4; Ellison Depo. at 289:1-23; Ellison Depo., Exh. 1 (July 21, 1994 memorandum from Merce). Finally, Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, filed a charge of discrimination on June 7, 1993 against Northwest with the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission and the EEOC and pursued this claim before the EEOC. Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. G.\\nThere are more examples demonstrating that Plaintiff was not mentally incapacitated during this period. On or about March 30, 1993, Plaintiff wrote Defendants\\' in house counsel Timothy Mahoney and requested a meeting to discuss his termination, disability and possible reinstatement. Defendants\\' Concise Stmt. at \u00b6 9. On April 20-21, 1993, Plaintiff attended an arbitration hearing on his union grievance in Minneapolis, Minnesota before the SBA. In November 1993, Plaintiff claims he called the EEOC office in Honolulu and notified it of his new telephone number and post office box address. Ellison Affid. at \u00b6 25; see also Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. H (EEOC log with 11\/9\/93 entry stating \"CP [charging party] called to discuss NRTS [presumably notice of right to sue] &amp; new phone no.\"). Finally, in December 1993, Plaintiff claims he called the EEOC regarding the status of his complaint and the issuance of a right to sue letter. Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. I; Ellison Affid. at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\\n\\n2. After January 11, 1994\\n\\nIn order to evaluate Plaintiff\\'s mental condition subsequent to January 11, 1994, the Court considers the affidavit of Plaintiff\\'s doctor, Dr. Alvin Murphy, which affidavit describes the progression of Plaintiff\\'s condition in part as follows:\\n2. ... [S]ince July 31, 1992, ... [Plaintiff] was clearly disabled and unable to work.\\n\\n3. Plaintiff had been hospitalized (7\/24\/92 to 7\/31\/92) and diagnosed as suffering from severe depression with accompanying anxiety due to work stresses.\\n\\n4. During early 1993, Plaintiff was dysphoric, agitated, chronically cried, and had sleep problems.\\n\\n5. On January 29, 1993, Plaintiff was again hospitalized with suicidal ideation[,] reduced sociability, increased irritability, and difficulties with maintaining his usual daily activities.\\n\\n. . . . .\\n7. During late March 1993, Plaintiff attempted suicide by taking an overdose of Pamelor.\\n8. On June 1, 1993, Plaintiff was re-admitted to The Queen\\'s Medical Center because of persistent severe depression; [h]e was retarded, discouraged, and suicidal.\\n\\n. . . . .\\n10. On June 19, 1993, Plaintiff again was re-admitted to [Queen\\'s] with suicidal ideation.\\n\\n11. In July 1993, Plaintiff\\'s diagnosis was Major Depression, Recurrent DSM 296.33....\\n13. On August 13, 1993, Plaintiff\\'s diagnosis was still Major Depression, Recurrent DSM 296.33.... He suffered sleep problems, dysphoria, anhedonia, appetite and weight changes, difficulties in energy, motivation, concentration....\\n14. On November 5, 1993, I reported to Plaintiff\\'s worker\\'s compensation insurance carrier that although the patient does seem improved, he is far from being in condition to return to his job....\\n15. Later on November 30, 1993, Plaintiff reportedly was upset for having to go on welfare; he was still polyarthralgia (neuralgic pain in more than one joint) noting he walked like a 60 year old; and though feeling better was fatigued.\\n\\n16. During 1994, I was still treating Plaintiff, who was still disabled and unable to work.\\n\\n17. Though doing relatively better in January 1994, Plaintiff was still dysfunctional and being medicated with Ritalin, *1512 Parnate, Tamazepam (Restoril), Ambien, Diazepam, and Trazedone (Desyrel).\\n. . . . .\\n19. In March of 1994, Plaintiff was still depressed about his condition, i.e., his inability to work, his depression was up and down but generally better....\\n20. During April 1994, Plaintiff was still \"up and down\"; on April 15, was noted as chronic emergency; on April 19[,] appeared to be moderately depressed, but not tearful; the following week, however, April 22 and 26, Plaintiff seemed to improve, but by the 29th appeared more paranoid.\\n\\n. . . . .\\n22. In June 1994, Plaintiff still up and down and was still having difficulty functioning in the most rudimentary ways and going through mood swings; [i]n addition to his other medications, Plaintiff was prescribed Valium.\\n23. In July 1994, Plaintiff reported wondering why he was so reluctant to go out or be around people. At this time, Plaintiff appeared confused as to what his goals were, he related he would either do himself in or find a new career; he was still dysfunctional in the most rudimentary ways.\\n24. During this period, Defendants\\' Expert George D. Bussey, M.D., evaluated Plaintiff and submitted to me his \"differential diagnosis ... as follows:\\nAxis I \\x97 Major depression, recurrent vs. dysthymic disorder....\\nAxis II \\x97 (Primary diagnosis) Mixed personality disorder with histrionic, dependent, narcissistic, paranoid, and antisocial traits....\\nAxis IV \\x97 Moderate to severe acute and chronic stressors. Mr. Ellison is unemployed, isolated from any social support networks, and living on the couch in someone else\\'s home.\\nAxis V \\x97 Current and highest global assessment of functioning in the past year (as presented by Mr. Ellison), 40-50.\"\\n25. In August 1994, Plaintiff was more depressed than recently, suicidal, and appeared to take a turn for the worse.\\n\\n26. By late August 1994, his friend and roommate related that Plaintiff no longer lay in bed all day, which was definitely an improvement and that he was able to concentrate when he wishes, but still forgets things, leaves doors unlocked, and still had difficulty prioritizing, tearful, difficulty making lists and getting things done, and setting goals.\\n27. By September [1994], Plaintiff was still \"up and down\" between \"apparently suicidal\" tendencies and stability.\\n\\n28. It was difficult at this time to tell whether his behavior was due to long term dysfunctional habits or from the effects of depression or from the effects of medication.\\nPlaintiff\\'s Concise Stmt., Murphy Affid. at 1-5 (emphasis added).\\nDr. Murphy\\'s affidavit indicates that despite the fact that Plaintiff was \"clearly disabled and unable to work,\" \"retarded, discouraged, and suicidal,\" and was suffering from, inter alia, \"persistent severe depression,\" \"suicidal ideation,\" and \"difficulties in energy, motivation [and] concentration,\" he nevertheless was able, during the period from August 12, 1994 through January 11, 1994, to manage all of his legal affairs as described in the preceding section.\\nDr. Murphy\\'s affidavit also indicates that at least during the 90 day period following January 11, 1994, Plaintiff\\'s condition \"seemed to improve\" and was \"generally better.\" In any event, there is no evidence Plaintiff\\'s condition was worse after January 11, 1994. There is also no evidence Plaintiff ever was mentally incapacitated to the point of being unable to deal with his legal affairs. Even in August 1994, after he \"was more depressed than recently, suicidal, and appeared to take a turn for the worse,\" Plaintiff nevertheless still was able to request another right to sue letter from the EEOC.\\nThe Court accordingly finds that at least during the 90 day period following January 11, 1994, there is no genuine triable issue of equitable tolling by reason of mental incapacity. Plaintiff\\'s ADA claim therefore must be dismissed on this basis alone. Alternatively, the Court makes the same finding for the *1513 entire period from January 1994 through August 1994. In any event, Plaintiff\\'s ADA claim is dismissed as untimely. See, e.g., Biester v. Midwest Health Serv., Inc., 77 F.3d 1264, 1268 (10th Cir.1996) (declining to toll 90 day period for mental incapacity due to \"major depression\" where no \"exceptional circumstances\" alleged \\x97 plaintiff was not \"adjudged incompetent or institutionalized\" and \"the evidence demonstrates that, in spite of his mental condition, [plaintiff] `was capable of pursuing his own claim,\\'\" inasmuch as he \"wrote to the EEOC ... to request a right to sue notice\"); Miller v. Runyon, 77 F.3d 189, 191 (7th Cir.1996) (\"[M]ental illness tolls a statute of limitations only if the illness in fact prevents the sufferer from managing his affairs and thus from understanding his legal rights and acting upon them.... Most mental illnesses today are treatable by drugs that restore the patient to at least a reasonable approximation of normal mentation and behavior.\") (emphasis in original).\\nFinally, and again alternatively, the Court dismisses Plaintiff\\'s ADA claim because there is no evidence Defendants terminated him because of his mental illness. Nelson states in his affidavit that he did not receive or become aware of Dr. Murphy\\'s note dated July 31, 1992 \\x97 stating \"To Whom it May Concern ... [Plaintiff] is seen for the first time today. He is clearly disabled and unable to work. The period of disability is unclear at present.\" \\x97 until August 25, 1992, after he already had terminated Plaintiff on August 12, 1992. Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. C; Nelson Affid. at \u00b6 7. Plaintiff presents no evidence to oppose this. Moreover, although Dr. Kai\\'s letter dated July 30, 1992 (which Nelson received on August 7, 1992) states that Plaintiff \"will see a psychiatrist of his choice,\" the letter also states that \"[Plaintiff] will return to his job on Monday, August 3rd.\" Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. A (emphasis added).\\nAccordingly, even assuming Defendants had notice as a result of Dr. Kai\\'s July 30, 1992 letter that Plaintiff was suffering from a mental illness, there is no evidence Defendants knew that Plaintiff was disabled as a result of that mental illness. In fact, Defendants were told by Plaintiff\\'s doctor that Plaintiff would be coming back to work that coming Monday (July 30, 1992 was a Thursday). Consistent with this, Nelson states in his affidavit that he fired Plaintiff because Plaintiff \"was absent without leave on August 3-7, 1992 and August 10-12, 1992,\" based on \"Dr. Kai\\'s letter stat[ing] that [Plaintiff] would be able to return to work on August 3, 1992.\" Nelson Affid. at \u00b6 6.\\nThe Court accordingly finds there is no genuine issue that Defendants did not fire Plaintiff because of his mental illness. See, e.g., Miller v. Runyon, 77 F.3d 189, 192 (7th Cir.1996) (\"[T]he Postal Service did not fire Miller because of his [mental] illness. It fired him because even though his psychiatrist had pronounced him able to return to work, he did not return. Miller\\'s superiors had no reason to believe that he was prevented from returning by his mental illness.\") (emphasis added).[2]\\n\\n\\n*1514 II. WRONGFUL TERMINATION\\n\\nThe nature of Plaintiff\\'s claim of \"wrongful termination while on medical leave due to occupational injury\" is somewhat obscure. In their moving papers, Defendants noted that Plaintiff seemed to be alleging a public policy wrongful discharge claim based on Parnar v. Americana Hotels, Inc., 65 Haw. 370, 652 P.2d 625 (1982) and H.R.S. \u00a7 378-32(2), which prohibits an employer from discharging an employee \"[s]olely because the employee has suffered a work injury which arose out of and in the course of the employee\\'s employment.\" See Defendants\\' Mot. at 7-8. Defendants argued that if so, Plaintiff\\'s claim is barred because H.R.S. Ch. 378 itself provides a sufficient remedy for its violation. Id.; see also Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 378-33 (aggrieved employee may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations); Ross v. Stouffer Hotel Co. (Hawaii) Ltd., Inc., 76 Hawai`i 454, 464, 879 P.2d 1037 (1994) (Parnar claim is barred \"where the policy sought to be vindicated is already embodied in a statute [in Ross as here, HRS Ch. 378] providing its own remedy for its violation. The fact that the relief available under Ross\\'s HRS \u00a7 378-2 claim is limited to equitable relief ... does not change our conclusion.\"). The Court agrees.[3]\\n\\nIII. INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS\\n\\nIn his opposition, Plaintiff states he \"is not alleging a public policy tort claim such as that found in [Parnar].\" Plaintiff\\'s Opp. at 10.[4] Instead, Plaintiff claims he suffered \"severe emotional and mental distress\" as a result of Defendants\\' harassment, citing H.R.S. \u00a7 386-5. Id. Section 386-5 states in relevant part:\\nThe rights and remedies herein granted to an employee ... on account of a work injury suffered by the employee shall exclude all other liability of the employer to the employee, ... at common law or otherwise, on account of the injury, except for sexual harassment or sexual assault and infliction of emotional distress or invasion of privacy related thereto, in which case a civil action may also be brought.\\n\\nId. (emphasis added) (second emphasized phrase added by 1992 amendments effective June 19, 1992).\\nFirst, the Court finds that all of Plaintiff\\'s emotional distress claims constitute a \"work injury\" arising from the conditions of his employment. See Plaintiff\\'s Opp., Exh. 7 (decision of Department of Labor and Industrial Relations awarding Plaintiff workers\\' compensation for stress and depression caused by harassment at work); Ellison Affid. at 1-7 (listing incidents of harassment at work); see also Courtney v. Canyon Television &amp; Appliance Rental, Inc., 899 F.2d 845, 851 (9th Cir.1990) (HRS \u00a7 386-5, bars emotional distress claims \"as long as there is a `causal connection between the injury and any incidents or conditions of employment ... regardless of where or when the injury\\' took place\") (quoting Chung v. Animal Clinic, Inc., 63 Haw. 642, 648-49, 636 P.2d 721 (1981)).\\nHowever, no claim of work related infliction of emotional distress is viable outside the exclusivity bar of H.R.S. \u00a7 386-5 unless *1515 it is \"related to\" sexual harassment or sexual assault. Here, Plaintiff alleges no sexual harassment or sexual assault.\\nAccordingly, H.R.S. \u00a7 386-5 bars all of Plaintiff\\'s negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress claims against Northwest and against Nelson for conduct within the scope of his employment. See, supra, Courtney, 899 F.2d at 851 (holding prior to 1992 amendments that HRS \u00a7 386-5 bars emotional distress claims \"as long as there is a `causal connection between the injury and any incidents or conditions of employment ... regardless of where or when the injury\\' took place\"); O\\'Connor v. Hilton Hawaiian Village, 763 F. Supp. 1544, 1549 (D.Haw.1990) (same); Marshall v. Univ. of Hawaii, 9 Haw. App. 21, 38, 821 P.2d 937 (1991) (adopting Ninth Circuit\\'s holding in Courtney); see also Wangler v. Hawaiian Elec. Co., Inc., 742 F. Supp. 1465, 1468 (D.Haw.1990) (\"[A]lthough the exclusivity provision of Hawaii\\'s workers compensation law extends immunity to co-employees acting within the scope of their employment, it does not relieve co-employees of liability to the extent that a fellow employee\\'s personal injury is caused by their `wilful and wanton misconduct.\\'\") (citing HRS \u00a7 386-8 and Morishige v. Spencecliff Corp., 720 F. Supp. 829, 837 (D.Haw. 1989)).\\nWith respect to Nelson individually, however, H.R.S. \u00a7 386-8 provides that \"[a]nother employee of the same employer shall not be relieved of his liability as a third party, if the personal injury is caused by his wilful and wanton misconduct.\" Hawaii courts have held that this provision preserves a plaintiff\\'s right of action in common law or under another statute against a fellow employee individually and \"clearly allows an employee to sue a fellow employee for damages resulting from an injury caused by the fellow employee\\'s willful and wanton misconduct.[5]\" Marshall v. Univ. of Hawaii, 9 Haw. App. 21, 36, 821 P.2d 937 (1991) (footnote in original); see also Hun v. Ctr. Properties, 63 Haw. 273, 277, 626 P.2d 182 (1981) (\"HRS \u00a7 386-8 does not establish an independent or new cause of action ... [but] preserv[es] the plaintiff\\'s right of action in common law or under a statute.\"); Wangler v. Hawaiian Elec. Co., Inc., 742 F. Supp. 1465, 1468 (D.Haw.1990) (exclusivity provision of HRS \u00a7 386-5 \"does not relieve co-employees of liability to the extent that a fellow employee\\'s personal injury is caused by their `wilful and wanton misconduct\\'\").\\nHere, although H.R.S. \u00a7 386-8 may allow a claim against Nelson individually for intentional infliction of emotional distress, it does not allow one for simply negligent infliction of emotional distress. See Marshall v. Univ. of Hawaii, 9 Haw.App. 21, 36, 821 P.2d 937 (1991) (conduct must be \"wilful and wanton\").\\nIn addition, any claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress (and for that matter any claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress) is subject to the two year statute of limitations in H.R.S. \u00a7 657-7, which states:\\nActions for the recovery of compensation for damage or injury to persons or property shall be instituted within two years after the cause of action accrued, and not after, except as provided in section 657-13 [disability by reason of infancy, insanity or imprisonment].\\nSee Linville v. State of Hawaii, 874 F. Supp. 1095, 1104 (D.Haw.1994) (two year period in HRS \u00a7 657-7 \"applies to ... personal injury claims of negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress\").\\nPlaintiff was sent home on July 17, 1992 and never returned to work. He did not file the instant suit until November 23, 1994. Moreover, in light of the discussion in Section I above, the Court finds there is no genuine issue of disability by reason of insanity or mental incapacity in general, and there certainly is none by reason of infancy or imprisonment. Accordingly, any claims against Nelson individually for negligent or *1516 intentional infliction of emotional distress are dismissed.[6]\\n\\nIV. RETALIATORY DISCHARGE\\n\\nPlaintiff\\'s final claim is one for \"[r]etaliatory discharge based on [his] refusal to violate [FAA] rules regarding airplane maintenance and clearance procedures.\" Defendants\\' Concise Stmt., Exh. J at Interrogatory No. 1. Despite Plaintiff\\'s earlier denial, this appears to be a public policy wrongful discharge claim based on Parnar v. Americana Hotels, Inc., 65 Haw. 370, 652 P.2d 625 (1982), and the Court will construe it as such.\\nDefendants argue that Plaintiff\\'s claim of retaliatory discharge is barred by the two year statute of limitations in H.R.S. \u00a7 657-7. See Linville v. State of Hawaii, 874 F. Supp. 1095, 1104 (D.Haw.1994) (Title IX wrongful discharge discrimination claim subject to two year statute of limitations under HRS \u00a7 657-7); cf. Pele Defense Fund v. Paty, 73 Haw. 578, 597, 837 P.2d 1247 (1992) (HRS \u00a7 657-7 is the \"general\" personal injury statute of limitations and applies to all \"actions for the recover of compensation for damage or injury to persons,\" including 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims).\\nPlaintiff does not dispute the applicability of the two year limitations period but contends it should be equitably tolled for mental incapacity. As discussed in Section I.B above, here the Court finds no genuine issue of equitable tolling on the basis of mental incapacity. Accordingly, Plaintiff\\'s claim of retaliatory discharge is dismissed as untimely.[7]\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendants\\' motion for summary judgment. There are no remaining claims.\\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Although on August 7, 1992, Nelson did receive a letter from Dr. Kai regarding Plaintiff\\'s medical treatment.\\n[2]  Defendants also argue in their reply at page 14 that because \"Plaintiff admits he is receiving total disability benefits from Workers\\' Compensation [and] has applied for long term disability benefits and Social Security disability benefits,\" he is estopped from claiming he is a \"qualified individual with a disability\" entitled to protection under the ADA \\x97 since \"qualified\" means the individual \"can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8); see Garcia-Paz v. Swift Textiles, Inc., 873 F. Supp. 547, 555 (D.Kan.1995) (plaintiff who represented in connection with applications for long term disability insurance benefits and Social Security disability benefits that she was totally disabled was estopped from claiming she was a \"qualified individual with a disability\" under ADA); McNeill v.

Kaiser Found. Health Plan of North Carolina, 859 F. Supp. 963, 969-70 (E.D.N.C.1994) (court stated that plaintiff who certified she was totally disabled in order to receive long term disability insurance benefits \"cannot speak out of both sides of her mouth with equal vigor and credibility before this court\" but also held there was no genuine issue for purposes of summary judgment); Harden v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 900 F.

Supp. 1528, 1538 (N.D.Ala.1995) (plaintiff\\'s testimony at workers\\' compensation trial that he was unable to perform the essential functions of any job at defendant\\'s plant estopped him from claiming he was \"qualified\" individual under ADA, citing Garcia-Paz); Cline v. Western Horseman, Inc., 922 F. Supp. 442, 447-449 (D.Colo.1996) (granting summary judgment based on estoppel and on the evidence in the record); but cf. Morton v. GTE North Inc., 922 F. Supp. 1169, (N.D.Tex. 1996) (expressing opinion that \"[t]he Garcia-Paz strict estoppel approach finds no support in the case law\" and that instead representations of disability are only evidence to be considered in determining whether there exists a genuine issue of standing).\\n\\nPlaintiff does not dispute Defendants\\' assertions regarding his representations of total disability. The Court accordingly finds in the alternative that Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue an ADA claim, both under a strict estoppel theory and because there is no genuine issue that Plaintiff is not a \"qualified\" individual under the statute.\\n[3]  The Court also finds in the alternative that there is no genuine issue that Defendants terminated Plaintiff not because of any occupational injury but because Plaintiff failed to appear for work even though his doctor stated he would. See, supra, Section I.B.2.\\n[4]  Any such claims accordingly are dismissed.\\n[5]  Black\\'s Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed. 1979), defines \"willful\" as:\\n\\nPremeditated; malicious; done with evil intent, or with a bad motive or purpose, or with indifference to the natural consequences; unlawful; without legal justification.\\n[6]  Alternatively, the Court finds that the allegations in Plaintiff\\'s affidavit concerning his alleged \"harassment\" at work raise no genuine issue of \"outrageous\" conduct necessary to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Wong v. Panis, 7 Haw.App. 414, 421, 772 P.2d 695 (1989) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46, cmt. d (1965)).\\n[7]  Defendants also argue that Plaintiff\\'s Parnar-based claim of retaliatory discharge is preempted by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, codified and amended July 5, 1994, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713(b)(1) (formerly 49 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a)(1)), which preempts any state law \"related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier.\" See Marlow v.

Tseu, 1995 WL 549319, *2 (D.Haw.1995) (disability discrimination and retaliation claims of monocular pilot applicant barred by Act); but see Ruggiero v. AMR Corp., 1995 WL 549010, *9 (N.D.Cal.1995) (declining to follow Marlow and relying instead on Anderson v. American Airlines, Inc., 2 F.3d 590, 597 (5th Cir.1993) (Act did not preempt a claim for money damages of retaliatory discharge for filing a workers\\' compensation claim) in finding no preemption).

Jones brought this action against the District of Columbia and David Rivers, then Director of the District\\'s Department of Human Services (DHS), alleging sexual discrimination and retaliation arising out of her employment at DHS. After a trial on the merits, the Court concludes, for the reasons set forth below, that plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence her case of discrimination and retaliation.\\n\\nI. Background\\nJoan Jones is a 47 year-old female who has, with minor exceptions, enjoyed a long career of employment with the District of Columbia in the area of health and social services. She began working for DHS\\' predecessor in 1965, starting as a DS-7 social worker and eventually reaching the DS-11 level as supervisor of a unit that handled over 2000 cases. Trial Transcript (Tr.) 81-84; Joint Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute (\"JS\") 1. In 1973, Jones was selected as a DS-12 social welfare specialist in the office of Albert Russo, the Assistant Director for Social Services. Russo later became Deputy Director and then Director of Social Services, and plaintiff was selected as his Executive Assistant *773 and Executive Officer, respectively. By 1978, Ms. Jones had been promoted to Assistant to the Director for Social Services and had reached the DS-15 grade level.\\nIn 1979, DHS was reorganized as a result of the new administration entering under Mayor Marion Barry. Ms. Jones\\' position was not affected by the change, but Albert Russo resigned in 1980 and was replaced by James Burford. Dissatisfied with what she considered scaled-back responsibilities under Burford, Jones left the District government in January 1982 to accept a one-year appointment at Howard University\\'s Graduate School of Social Work. In January 1983, plaintiff returned to DHS when she was selected for a temporary appointment as the Acting Chief of the Office of Policy and Planning (OPP), a position at the DS-15 level. In April 1983, however, that position was converted from DS-15 competitive status to the excepted service at the DS-16 level; it therefore became one of the 100 positions whose occupants serve at the pleasure of the Mayor. JS 8; D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1-610.1 et seq. At approximately the same time, Burford left DHS and was replaced as Director of DHS by David Rivers, who had been serving as Deputy Director since 1981. Jones received another temporary appointment as Acting OPP Chief in December 1983. Rivers was confirmed as the permanent Director of DHS in February of 1984.\\nThe turning point in plaintiff\\'s employment with DHS was the year 1984. In her capacity as a member of the Contracts Review Committee (CRC), an interagency group responsible for reviewing and approving DHS contracts in excess of $25,000, Jones attended a meeting in June 1984 and voted against a contract to provide services for the homeless at the Pitts Motor Hotel. On December 2, 1984, Rivers selected Carl Wilson, who was then serving as Director of DHS\\' State Health Planning and Development Agency (SHPDA), to become the permanent DS-16 Chief of OPP. On that same day, plaintiff was reassigned as Assistant to the Director for Special Initiatives, a DS-15 position. Shortly thereafter, Jones filed an internal charge of sex discrimination with Rivers, who denied the charges. In June 1985, plaintiff filed charges of discrimination and retaliation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\\nMs. Jones thereafter instituted this action against the District of Columbia and David Rivers.[1] Plaintiff alleges that a pattern of discrimination exists in DHS towards women above the DS-14 grade level and contends that, since April 1980, she has been \"thwarted in her efforts at career advancement\" by virtue of denial of promotions, reassignments to undesirable positions, and preferential treatment given to less-qualified male employees. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7. In Counts 1, 3 and 4, Jones maintains that this pattern and these acts constitute impermissible sex discrimination, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq., and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Plaintiff also asserts, in Counts 2, 5 and 6, that David Rivers impermissibly retaliated against her for opposing the Pitts contract and for filing her EEOC charges, in contravention of Title VII and Section 1983.[2] Having considered all of the testimony, exhibits and evidence adduced at the five-day bench trial, the parties\\' post-trial submissions, and the entire record in this case, the Court finds, for the reasons articulated below, that plaintiff Joan Jones has successfully proved by a preponderance of the evidence that she was discriminated against because of her sex and that she suffered retaliation during her employment with the District of Columbia.\\n\\nII. Discussion\\nPlaintiff\\'s claims fall into three categories. She asserts that she was the victim of sex discrimination because Carl Wilson, not she, was chosen for the OPP Chief position. She also maintains that Title VII was transgressed because David Rivers retaliated against her for filing an EEOC *774 complaint. Finally, she contends that her First Amendment rights were infringed because her opposition to the Pitts Hotel contract contributed to her nonselection for OPP Chief.\\n\\nA. Discrimination Claims\\n\\n1. Standards. Jones asserts sex discrimination under both Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Disparate treatment occurs under Title VII when a plaintiff shows that her \"employer treats some people less favorably than others\" because she is a woman. Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 2949, 57 L. Ed. 2d 957 (1978). The order and quantum of proof in disparate treatment cases was set forth by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), and its progeny. To succeed on her claim, plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1093, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). In the context of a failure to promote, this showing consists of proof that the plaintiff (1) belongs to a protected group, (2) was qualified for and applied for a promotion, (3) was considered for and denied the promotion, and (4) was passed by in favor of another employee with similar qualifications who was not within the protected group. Bundy v. Jackson, 641 F.2d 934, 951 (D.C.Cir.1981).\\nOnce a prima facie case has been made, a presumption of unlawful discrimination arises, see United States Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 714, 103 S. Ct. 1478, 1481, 75 L. Ed. 2d 403 (1983), which the employer may rebut by \"articulat[ing] some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\" for the challenged action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S. Ct. at 1824. If defendant carries this burden, the presumption \"drops from the case,\" Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255, 101 S. Ct. at 1094, and the party alleging discrimination must \"demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision [and] that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination.\" Id. at 256, 101 S. Ct. at 1095. Where, as here, a case has been fully tried on the merits, the question whether plaintiff has made out a prima facie case \"is no longer relevant\" and the court should proceed to the ultimate issue of whether discrimination has in fact occurred. Aikens, 460 U.S. at 715, 103 S. Ct. at 1482. Finally, the McDonnell Douglas framework also applies to plaintiff\\'s claim that defendants\\' acts of sex discrimination violated her due process rights protected under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Oates v. District of Columbia, 824 F.2d 87, 90 (D.C.Cir.1987).\\n2. Analysis. As noted above, plaintiff\\'s discrimination claim is that David Rivers selected Carl Wilson, rather than her, to be Chief of OPP because she was a woman. A variety of factors, described in detail below, convinces the Court that sex discrimination promoted the selection of Carl Wilson.\\nJoan Jones enjoyed a remarkable and distinguished career in the Department of Human Services. She rose rapidly through the agency from a DS-7 social worker to a DS-15 Assistant to the Director for Social Services. Plaintiff performed a wide variety of tasks along the way. She served as a caseworker for the elderly, she was the supervisor of a family services unit, and she dealt with rental payment and child care problems as a social welfare specialist. While managing the Director\\'s office as executive assistant to Albert Russo, Ms. Jones took the lead on projects relating to social rehabilitation, day care, targeted jobs and employee courtesy. In her spare time, plaintiff managed to raise a family and obtain a masters degree in social work from Howard University.\\nMs. Jones was more than simply a \"jack of all trades.\" The devotion to and quality of her work became evident at trial. Her performance evaluations throughout the years were uniformly outstanding. Plaintiff\\'s Group Exhibit (Pl.Gr.Ex.) 1. Moreover, the special skills that Jones possessed were described by a number of witnesses. One co-worker, Bernard Phifer, agreed *775 with an evaluation by plaintiff\\'s supervisor which noted that she \"demonstrated the ability to work with the most difficult social problems and to be willing to attempt new treatment methods with a high degree of success.\" Tr. 188-89. Richard Artis, Jones\\' assistant at OPP, stated that \"she exhibited the kinds of leadership qualities that I can professionally respond to,\" including delegation of authority and creativity in developing new solutions to old problems. Tr. 215-16. Calling Jones his \"alter ego,\" Albert Russo extensively described the qualities he valued in Joan Jones:\\nI\\'ve always regarded Mrs. Jones as a rather extraordinary woman, with great ability, great empathy, and great feeling for clients. I often told her that she was not only client-oriented, but also community oriented. She really cared....\\nSeveral times the thought [putting Jones in charge of running a specific program] did entertain my mind, but for perhaps selfish reasons, I discarded the idea ... And while I felt that she had certainly the ability to run several major programs within the Department, I felt that I wanted her to continue in her staff position because of the invaluable services she was providing.\\nDuring the seven years Mrs. Jones worked with me, she extraordinarily manifested the highest qualities of leadership that I have yet encountered up to that point in time in any female employee, or in any male employee.\\nTr. 254-259. Carl Wilson, a subordinate of Jones until he was selected as Chief of OPP (and a man who certainly had no motive to give such testimony), agreed that she was \"very analytical,\" very helpful,\" \"very patient,\" and \"cooperative.\" Tr. 326. Even David Rivers admitted that Jones was an \"intelligent,\" \"compassionate,\" \"dedicated\" and \"committed\" employee. Tr. 625-26.\\nAnother measure of Ms. Jones\\' unusual abilities was the warm personal relationship she enjoyed with members of her staff. During all of her time at DHS, not a single grievance or complaint was lodged against plaintiff by another employee, a fact that Albert Russo stated was \"an exceptional tribute to her ability to work well with people, and it spoke of the excellent interpersonal relationships that she had established, both with her peers, her superiors, and her subordinates.\" Tr. 256. Bernard Phifer related how plaintiff was once given a standing ovation by her fellow employees, a truly rare event in bureaucratic circles.\\nNonetheless, despite Ms. Jones\\' unblemished record of accomplishment and performance, it was Carl Wilson who was selected by Rivers for the position of Chief of OPP. Rivers maintained that plaintiff was not selected because she had not displayed \"leadership\" qualities while she served as acting Chief of OPP. Stating his preference for aggressive individuals, Rivers described Jones as \"timid\" and unable to take the difficult steps needed to properly interact with other agencies and pursue OPP programs in a timely fashion.[3] Rivers also observed that he had received complaints from other managers about Jones during her tenure as OPP Chief. Carl Wilson, according to Rivers, was better qualified to carry out the functions of OPP Chief.\\nThe \"leadership\" rationale offered by Rivers was severely undermined by the evidence presented in this case. For one thing, the concern about leadership expressed by Rivers and others at trial did not surface during the nearly one-quarter century of her exemplary government service but only after it was clear that litigation by Jones was imminent. None of Jones\\' performance evaluations contain any reservations about her management abilities. Indeed, Rivers gave Jones an excellent *776 performance evaluation for a one-year period in which he observed her work. Joint Gr.Ex. 3. Neither Rivers nor any other DHS official ever sent Jones a written memorandum highlighting existing deficiencies that needed to be corrected. The subject of leadership was not broached when Rivers informed Jones that he had selected Wilson for the job; to the contrary, Rivers said that Jones was a good manager but, citing his \"management prerogatives,\" informed her that the decision was the result of an \"executive rotation.\" When Jones filed an internal grievance, and later an EEOC complaint, the responses submitted by defendants never intimated that the selection decision was influenced by her lack of leadership skills. Pl. Exs. 23, 44, 46.[4] This post hoc rationale, unsupported by documentary evidence, strongly suggests that defendants\\' reason for not selecting Jones was pretextual in nature. See, e.g., Legrand v. Trustees of University of Arkansas, 821 F.2d 478, 482-83 (8th Cir.1987), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 108 S. Ct. 1592, 99 L. Ed. 2d 907 (1988).\\nQuite apart from the late date at which the \"leadership\" defense appears to have been constructed (as well as its lack of documentation), defendants\\' characterization of Jones\\' performance is suspect on several other grounds. Joan Jones\\' record as acting Chief of OPP, for example, stands prominently in the way. For twenty three months, plaintiff performed her job with distinction. Jones developed policy proposals for centralized planning and a uniform cost schedule for agency consultants, reviewed grant applications and hearing decisions and implemented a number of Mayoral recommendations. Plaintiff was also responsible for coordinating the One Fund drive, a project that raised monies for arts and services organizations and for which Jones received letters of commendation from James Burford and Mayor Barry. Pl.Gr.Ex. 4. On a larger scale, Ms. Jones developed a program under which recipients of DHS welfare and social service funds would eliminate their dependence on public assistance. This \"self-sufficiency\" initiative soon assumed city-wide significance, when an inter-agency task force was established and the private sector became involved. OPP produced a comprehensive document entitled \"Ten Steps to Client Self-Sufficiency,\" in which almost every other interested District agency expressed support. Pl.Ex. 24. In addition, Jones was actively involved in producing a teenage pregnancy prevention program within OPP, which ultimately resulted in the establishment of a blue ribbon panel and personal thanks from Mayor Barry. See Tr. 36-54. These accomplishments convincingly rebut defendants\\' contention that plaintiff was neither a leader nor aggressive enough to reach consensus with other components of DHS and agencies within the District of Columbia government.\\nMoreover, our court of appeals has warned that \"heightened scrutiny\" must be applied when an employer relies on subjective factors (such as leadership) rather than objective ones in reaching its decision. Bishopp v. District of Columbia, 788 F.2d 781, 787 (D.C.Cir.1986). The complaints voiced by Rivers and others were quite vague, however, lacking the degree of specificity one would normally expect when difficulties in employee performance are encountered. For example, Rivers spoke of \"some dialogue\" he had with Jones about several issues (such as teen pregnancy, homelessness and infant mortality) that \"were hounding me,\" Tr. 644, yet he was unable to recall any of the times, dates or locations of those discussions and did not memorialize his concerns in memoranda to Jones, to any other DHS employee or even to his own files.[5] Audrey Rowe, then Commissioner of Social Services, testified that Jones\\' predecessor, Barbara Sable, was a far better Chief of OPP than Jones, that *777 planning in OPP stopped when plaintiff took over and that the processing of administrative orders became bogged down under Jones. Under cross-examination, however, Rowe was impeached by prior testimony in which she admitted no opinion on Jones\\' effectiveness as a leader, Tr. 533, and she displayed a surprising lack of recall about planning meetings between Jones and her staff and about particular administrative orders that were allegedly not processed in a timely manner. Tr. 524-29; 541-58.[6] And although former City Councilwoman Polly Shackleton similarly questioned the effectiveness of plaintiff while heading OPP, and contrasted Jones\\' performance with that of her admired predecessor, Mrs. Shackleton later admitted that she had never worked directly with Jones and could identify no specific aspect of Jones\\' performance that was deficient. These sorts of unfocused and undocumented criticisms do not pass the \"heightened scrutiny\" required by Bishopp, especially when they are juxtaposed with the positive record of achievement compiled by Jones during her long career.\\nSeveral other DHS employees also testified. Byron Marshall accused plaintiff of failing to develop coherent budget policies; Virginia Fleming stated that Rivers never treated her (Fleming) differently because she was a woman; and Barbara Walker testified (as will be explored infra) about events occurring after Jones was not selected for the OPP position. Each of these individuals, however, had substantial ties to Rivers. Marshall, who enjoyed a meteoric rise at DHS, admitted that he attended basketball games and drank beer with Rivers. Fleming conceded her connections to the Barry administration, and Walker described Rivers as her \"mentor.\" In addition, Audrey Rowe admitted that she was social friends with Rivers and with Marshall. In short, most of the witnesses offered by defendants were closely intertwined with Rivers and with each other (either personally or professionally or both) at the time of the events in question, and could scarcely be considered to be wholly objective observers.\\nAdditional evidence of discrimination is found in the make-up of top-level employees at DHS. On October 1, 1984, David Rivers signed an affirmative action report as Director of DHS. Pl.Ex. 20. The report found that females, both black and white, were underrepresented at the DS-16 level in the agency and set hiring goals to alleviate that disparity. David Rivers\\' actions, however, failed to keep the spirit of that document. Although Rivers boasted that he brought several women onto his staff, none was hired at the DS-16 level. More significantly, of the thirteen managers occupying DS-16 positions or higher from 1981 to 1986, only three were women, two of whom received their DS-16 appointments after plaintiff filed her sex discrimination grievance.[7] This situation stands in stark contrast to the situation of DHS as a whole: in 1985, for example, a full two-thirds of all employees at DHS were women. Pl.Ex. 34, \u00b6 13. The nonselection of Joan Jones, therefore, was not an isolated event, for it is consistent with a pattern that existed at the highest echelons of DHS management. Having advanced without a negative mark on her record to that point, plaintiff was confronted with a situation where her sex became an impediment to further advancement.\\n*778 There finally remains to be considered the selection of Carl Wilson. Although Rivers stated that he chose Wilson because he was better qualified that Jones, Wilson\\'s own testimony indicates that Rivers had decided to remove Jones first, and only then cast about for a suitable replacement:\\nQ. Mr. Wilson, you talked about your [sic] becoming OPP Chief and applying for the position. As I understand it, you knew that position was posted in 1983; isn\\'t that true?\\nA. That\\'s true.\\nQ. And you didn\\'t apply at that time.\\nA. No, I did not.\\nQ. You looked at the posting, considered it, but were happy where you were. Isn\\'t that true?\\nA. That\\'s true, yes.\\nQ. And later on, in the fall of 1984, David Rivers sought you out to become the OPP Chief, isn\\'t that correct?\\nA. That\\'s correct.\\nQ. And before that time you really weren\\'t interested in the job; isn\\'t that true?\\nA. That\\'s correct. I really didn\\'t pursue the job prior to that.\\nQ. And what David Rivers told you was that Joan Jones was going to move on; isn\\'t that true?\\nA. He indicated that she would be moving to another position, yes.\\nTr. 339. Several other considerations also undermine Rivers\\' choice of Wilson. For one thing, the bulk of Mr. Wilson\\'s experience was in the area of health, not (as in the case of Jones) in the provision of social services. In addition, Wilson\\'s major accomplishment as head of SHPDA, the development of a state health plan, was pursued in accordance with federally-produced criteria, a situation that would seem to contradict Rivers\\' desire for a creative person in the OPP Chief\\'s position. Finally, Richard Artis, who was the only subordinate of both Jones and Wilson to testify at trial, stated his opinion that Jones was the \"more effective leader\" of the two. Tr. 216. Given these circumstances, the sterling achievements of Jones during her long career at the agency, the fact that Jones had served admirably in the OPP Chief position for twenty three months, and the failure of DHS and Rivers to alleviate the severe underrepresentation of women at the GS-16 level, the aggressive recruitment of Jones\\' subordinate (who was content in his own position) to take the job she was performing does not appear to be a legitimate and justified managerial decision.\\nWilson\\'s selection is understandable only if one concludes, as the Court now does, that it was motivated by discrimination based on sex. While this determination is never lightly reached, the evidence presented points unmistakably in that direction. A woman enjoys a steady and rapid rise through the ranks of the District of Columbia government, serving with distinction whenever she is called on. She is considered an extraordinary employee. Upon reaching a level dominated by men, she is passed over (in favor of a man) for a position that she has already held for almost two years. The man who refused to promote her, and several of his close associates, now maintain that she lacked \"leadership\" abilities. Unlike the woman\\'s stellar record of achievement and accomplishment, however, these concerns are not set forth in any contemporaneous documentation, and thus might well be considered as pretextual (especially when viewed through the prism of her prior accomplishments). These facts speak clearly. They demonstrate that Joan Jones was not selected as Chief of the Office of Planning and Placement because she was a woman. No other reasonable conclusion may be drawn from the evidence.\\n\\nB. Retaliation: Title VII\\n\\n1. Standards. In Count 2, plaintiff contends that David Rivers retaliated against her because she opposed his acts of discrimination and because she filed discrimination charges with the EEOC, in violation of Title VII. In analyzing that claim, the Court is also guided by the McDonnell Douglas formulation used in disparate treatment cases. The prima facie case differs, however. To show retaliation, plaintiff must prove that (1) she was engaged in a statutorily-protected activity; *779 (2) an adverse personnel action was taken against her; and (3) a causal link exists between the two. McKenna v. Weinberger, 729 F.2d 783, 790 (D.C.Cir.1984). A causal connection may be established by proving that \"the employer had knowledge of the employee\\'s protected activity, and that the adverse personnel action took place shortly after that activity.\" Mitchell v. Baldridge, 759 F.2d 80, 86 (D.C.Cir. 1985).\\n2. Analysis. It is evident that, when plaintiff lodged her internal grievance with David Rivers on December 21, 1984 and her EEOC charges in May 1985, she was engaged in activity protected by Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3. It is equally clear that, soon after these complaints were registered, adverse employment action was taken. Jones testified that immediately after she filed her internal grievance Rivers called her on the telephone. Using an angry voice and shouting, Rivers told her that she should not have gotten a lawyer to file a grievance, that Jones would never become Chief of OPP as long as he was Director of DHS and that, if she wanted a \"shoot-out,\" he would give her one. In his testimony, Rivers only denied that he had used the words \"shoot out\" but did not challenge any other aspect of plaintiff\\'s recollection of the call. Tr. 593-94. Soon thereafter, the nature of plaintiff\\'s employment changed drastically. Occupying a position \\x97 Special Assistant to the Director for Special Initiatives \\x97 that David Rivers acknowledged would be downgraded when she left it, Jones first saw her duties taken from her and given to Brenda Walker, a former student intern who viewed David Rivers as her mentor. Plaintiff soon found that Walker was reviewing her correspondence and critiquing her \"Ten Steps to Self-Sufficiency\" plan. Although Walker testified that she performed similar tasks in other areas, plaintiff\\'s situation was different, since she had pioneered the self-sufficiency initiative and was Rivers\\' special assistant on that issue.\\nMore significantly, however, Ms. Jones\\' efforts to craft programs and carry out projects were stifled at every turn. The cornerstone of the self-sufficiency program, the establishment of an Office of Self-Sufficiency (OSS), was stalled under the administration of Rivers, who again asserted vague concerns about the \"structure\" and \"coordination\" of the OSS.[8] Ultimately, Byron Marshall, who also expressed reservations about the plan, approved the OSS after working out differences he had with Jones. A more blatant instance occurred when Rivers was scheduled to testify before the City Council in 1986. To prepare Rivers for anticipated questions from Councilwoman Shackleton, Jones prepared a memorandum describing how approximately 440 individuals had received training through OSS programs. Pl.Ex. 26. At the hearing, however, Rivers stated that only 17 people had been trained. After the meeting, budget monies were taken from OSS and transferred to the Income Maintenance Administration (IMA), a component of the Commission on Social Services. Rivers described his statement as a \"mistake,\" and defendants maintained at trial, through the testimony of Marshall and Shackleton, that the decision to shift the funds was made because OSS was duplicating the efforts of IMA in the area of training. On cross-examination, however, Shackleton could not provide any details of the nature of the alleged duplication and Marshall admitted that the transfer of funds resulted from the City Council hearing. On another occasion, Ms. Jones began preparations for a nationwide conference on self-sufficiency to be held in the District of Columbia, developing a conference notice and a planning workbook. Pl.Gr.Ex. 30a &amp; e. Rivers postponed the conference, stating at trial that he had \"not been briefed fully\" and was \"not comfortable enough\" with event plans. This concern, however, directly contradicts Mr. Rivers\\' avowed desire for \"aggressive\" action within DHS. In addition, although Marshall noted that he did not believe that *780 Jones could arrange all the conference details in a short period of time, he later conceded that he had no idea of how long Jones and OSS had been planning the event.\\nIt is ironic that, although Rivers complained that Jones was not aggressive enough in carrying out programs during her tenure as OPP Chief, he undertook to frustrate creative attempts made by plaintiff after she filed her discrimination complaint. Although a full accounting of plaintiff\\'s allegations is unnecessary, the examples cited above demonstrate, without doubt, that plaintiff suffered adverse employment actions after she filed her EEOC grievance. Moreover, the sheer number of incidents and their timing demonstrate that these actions were causally related to the filing of plaintiff\\'s EEOC charges. Accordingly, the Court concludes that defendants impermissibly retaliated against plaintiff because she filed an EEOC complaint.\\n\\nC. Retaliation: First Amendment\\n\\n1. Standards. Counts 5 and 6 assert that David Rivers transgressed plaintiff\\'s right to free speech guaranteed under the First Amendment. Plaintiff maintains that Rivers retaliated against her because she opposed a contract for the Pitts Hotel, an emergency shelter for homeless, by selecting Wilson for the OPP Chief\\'s job. In Hall v. Ford, 856 F.2d 255 (D.C.Cir.1988), our court of appeals recently summarized the law governing such claims:\\nThe Pickering [v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 20 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1968)] cause of action has four elements. First, the public employee must have been speaking on a matter of public concern. If the speech is not of public concern, \"it is unnecessary ... to scrutinize the reasons for [the] discharge,\" Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 146 [103 S. Ct. 1684, 1689, 75 L. Ed. 2d 708] (1983), at least \"absent the most unusual circumstances.\" Id. [461 U.S.] at 147 [103 S.Ct. at 1690]. Second, the court must \"balance\" the interests of the employee, \"as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public interest, and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\" Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568 [88 S.Ct. at 1734]. Third, the employee must prove that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor in his discharge. Mt. Health City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 [97 S. Ct. 568, 576, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471] (1977). Finally, the government employer must be given an opportunity to prove that it would have reached the same decision even absent the protected conduct. Id.\\n\\nId. at 258.\\n2. Analysis. The Pitts contract came before DHS\\'s Contracts Review Committee (CRC) on June 22, 1984. At the meeting, plaintiff expressed numerous reservations that she had about the contract: its excessive cost, its staffing patterns, the effect that the Pitts arrangement would have on families and the fact that the contract ran for three years rather than one. These comments clearly relate to a matter of public concern, which is speech that involves \"`issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable members of society\\' to make informed decisions about the operation of their government.\" Hall, 856 F.2d at 259 (citations omitted). Reservations about the manner and cost of providing shelter and care for the homeless of the District of Columbia surely meets this test.[9]\\nJones\\' interest in commenting on these matters of political and social concern must next be weighed against the government\\'s interest. In that regard, the Supreme Court has identified the following relevant factors:\\nwhether the statement impairs discipline by superiors or harmony among coworkers, has a detrimental impact on close working relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary, or impedes the performance of the speaker\\'s *781 duties or interferes with the regular operation of the enterprise.\\nRankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 107 S. Ct. 2891, 2899, 97 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1987). At trial, defendants did not present any evidence that Ms. Jones\\' statements about the Pitts contract affected employee relations or that they interfered with the operations of the DHS; indeed, despite plaintiff\\'s comments, the contract was approved by the CRC. Accordingly, there is no government interest that would justify retaliation against Ms. Jones.\\nDefendants\\' principal focus at trial concerned the third and fourth Pickering factors\\x97whether plaintiff had proved that her opposition to the Pitts contract was a substantial or motivating factor in her non-selection as OPP Chief and whether Wilson would have been selected even had plaintiff not expressed problems with the Pitts contract. The evidence adduced on these issues supports plaintiff\\'s retaliation claim.\\nImmediately after the Pitts vote, Rivers telephoned Jones. According to plaintiff, Rivers berated Jones for her vote, told her to address any concerns that she might have to Audrey Rowe and slammed down the telephone. Rivers acknowledged that his voice was not pleasant and that he \"chewed her [plaintiff] out\" on the telephone. No other CRC member who voted against the contract was called. Nevertheless, Rivers strenuously maintained that his displeasure was not due to her vote against the contract, but rather because Jones had simply voted \"no\" without providing any alternatives for the housing of homeless people. On cross-examination, however, Rivers admitted that alternatives to Pitts did in fact exist, such as a request for procurement and quantum meruit payments. Moreover, Rivers\\' recollection of his call to Jones was also somewhat confused. He initially stated that he told Jones of his concerns and, when she said nothing in response, he hung up the phone. Tr. 586. He later changed his view:\\nQ. And what happened next? Did you hear anything coming on the other end of the line?\\nA. I made my concern known to Joan. And I don\\'t recall her saying anything, whether it was\\x97it was probably because I hung up the phone, probably.\\n\\nTr. 671 (emphasis added). By his own admission, then, Rivers did not allow Jones to respond. Given these contradictions, Rivers\\' version of events loses credibility.\\nShortly after the conversation, the conditions of plaintiff\\'s employment deteriorated rapidly, as described elsewhere. In October 1984\\x97just four months later\\x97Rivers informed plaintiff that he had selected Carl Wilson for OPP Chief. Given the proximity in time of this decision to the Pitts opposition, the inconsistencies in Rivers\\' testimony, and the failure of defendants to articulate any legitimate reason for their promotion decision, the Court must conclude that plaintiff\\'s vocalized concern about the Pitts contract was a motivating factor in the decision by Rivers to choose Carl Wilson as head of OPP.\\n\\nIII. Conclusion\\nJoan Jones epitomized the oft-maligned notion of one who renders public service to those less fortunate than herself. The evidence presented demonstrated that her efforts and her career were abruptly halted simply because of her sex just as she reached the pinnacle of her service to the District of Columbia and its residents. Such discriminatory actions are prohibited by both Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and plaintiff has prevailed on her claims under those statutes. Judgment shall therefore be entered in her favor.\\nThere remains the matter of relief. At the time this action was instituted, plaintiff requested compensatory damages of $50,000 and punitive damages against Rivers in the amount of $100,000. At trial, however, plaintiff sought only $10,395 in compensatory damages and $10,000 in punitive damages. Tr. 778.[10] In addition, Ms. Jones seeks equitable relief (1) barring future *782 acts of discrimination and retaliation, (2) promoting her with back pay to the DS-17 level, which she maintains she would have reached absent the discriminatory conduct that defendants pursued, and (3) expunging any adverse material in files pertaining to her. She also asks for attorney\\'s fees and costs.\\nThe Court will defer the entry of relief for the time being. Given the delicate situation that discrimination suits can often produce, it appears useful for the parties to explore the question of relief among themselves, attempting to reach agreement consistent with the Court\\'s findings and in a manner that would accommodate both plaintiff\\'s rights and injuries as well as the District of Columbia\\'s personnel and administrative requirements. If the matter is not resolved, the Court will conduct a hearing on September 26, 1989 at 3:30 p.m. for the purpose of making its own determination in this regard.\\nA separate Judgment accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\\n\\nJUDGMENT\\nIn accordance with the Memorandum Opinion issued this date, judgment is hereby entered in favor of plaintiff, Joan V. Jones, and against defendants, David Rivers and the District of Columbia.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Rivers is sued in his official and individual capacities. Complaint at 1.\\n[2]  The District of Columbia is named as a defendant in Counts 1, 2, 4 and 6; Rivers is the defendant in Counts 3 and 5.\\n[3]  At another point, however, Rivers himself used the word \"aggressive\" to describe Ms. Jones\\' performance:\\n\\nQ. All right. Was Joan Jones diligent in her job?\\nA. Yes. Joan, no question about it. No matter what happens during this hearing, Joan is a person I\\'ve come to like and admire, given what she did best. She was very aggressive, she put in a lot of time in terms of taking on one situation at a time. She put in time, she was compassionate, and I think she really wanted to do a good job in that regard.\\nTr. 568-69 (emphasis added).\\n[4]  Defendants\\' response to Jones\\' EEOC grievance referred to leadership in one line in describing the OPP Chief job, but no assertion was made that Jones herself was not a leader. Pl.Ex. 44 at 4.\\n[5]  When pressed on cross-examination, Rivers admitted that he did not have a \"distinct recollection\" about conversations with Jones about homelessness issues.\\n[6]  The following colloquy, just one of many, took place regarding a memorandum and questionnaire that Rowe received dealing with self-sufficiency:\\n\\nQ. And exactly when did you receive that memo and questionnaire, Mrs. Rowe?\\nA. I can\\'t remember. It was right after the project. It was either a part of the initial development of the project or after the project got started, part of the information-gathering process.\\nQ. For what year, Mrs. Rowe?\\nA. As I said, I don\\'t remember.\\nQ. And how many pages was the memorandum, Mrs. Rowe?\\nA. I have no idea.\\nQ. What particular problem did you have with the memorandum in which you say it wasn\\'t well thought out, Mrs. Rowe?\\nA. The whole project, as far as I was concerned.\\nTr. 516-17.\\n[7]  The testimony of two of the DS-16 women, Rowe and Fleming, has been previously noted.\\n[8]  In response, Jones\\' staff wrote an unsolicited memorandum outlining their concerns and expressing their frustration with the pace of implementation of the self-sufficiency initiative. Pl.Gr.Ex. 31.\\n[9]  That plaintiff did not make her concerns public does not (as defendants suggest) alter this conclusion. Hall, 856 F.2d at 260 (a matter of public concern does not \"lose its importance merely because it arises in an employee dispute\").\\n[10]  The compensatory damages figure represents the amount Jones expended for psychological consulting fees after she lost weight, became tense and anxious, and suffered from work-induced depression and post-traumatic stress, as well as an additional $5,000 for mental distress.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 2592760}]"},{"id":42621,"date_filed":"2005-08-31","judges":"Anderson, Black, Kravitch, Per Curiam","case_name_full":"William L.

For the following reasons, we\\n\\naffirm.\\n\\n                                      I. Background\\n\\n       Warren was employed by defendant Schwerman Trucking Company from\\n\\napproximately November 3, 1970 through August 2, 1982. Warren was a\\n\\nparticipant in a pension fund established pursuant to a collective bargaining\\n\\nagreement entered into between a union and Schwerman Trucking Company.\\n\\nBetween September 1983 and November 1984, Warren filed various claims with\\n\\nthe pension plan for a monthly disability benefit. After pursuing these claims\\n\\nwithout success through the various stages of administrative review, in October\\n\\n1986, Warren filed a lawsuit against the pension plan, seeking to recover the\\n\\nbenefits.1 In that case, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the\\n\\npension plan, finding that \u201cthe defendant did not act in an arbitrary or capricious\\n\\n\\n       1\\n        This case was Warren v. The Health and Welfare Fund of the Central States Southeast\\nand Southwest Areas, 752 F. Supp. 452 (M.D. Ga. 1990).\\n\\n                                              2\\n\\x0cmanner in the handling of plaintiff\u2019s application or breach any fiduciary duties it\\n\\nmay have owed to plaintiff.\u201d In July 1993, Warren moved to re-open his October\\n\\n1986 complaint, on the basis that he discovered new evidence that his employer,\\n\\nSchwerman Trucking Company, had failed to properly contribute to the plan. The\\n\\ncourt denied the motion.\\n\\n      About ten years went by and, in September 2003, Warren filed the instant\\n\\naction, again alleging that his employer improperly contributed to the plan. The\\n\\ndefendants answered and moved for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P.\\n\\n12(c), or alternatively, for summary judgment. Because Warren filed documents\\n\\noutside of the pleadings, the court converted the motion to dismiss into one for\\n\\nsummary judgment and notified the parties. Subsequently, the district court\\n\\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Warren now appeals.\\n\\n                               II. Standard of Review\\n\\n      We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing\\n\\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. Wilson\\n\\nv. B\/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1085 (11th Cir. 2004). Summary judgment\\n\\nis appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\\n\\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\\n\\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           3\\n\\x0cjudgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Eberhardt v. Waters, 901 F.2d\\n\\n1578, 1580 (11th Cir. 1990).\\n\\n                                         III. Discussion\\n\\n       Warren offers little argument explaining how the district court erred, but we\\n\\nare mindful of his pro se status and, therefore, we address the merits of his claims.\\n\\nIn doing so, we conclude that, for several reasons, summary judgment was proper\\n\\nin this case. First, Warren brought this action pursuant to Title VII, but he fails to\\n\\nallege that he was discriminated against on the basis of his membership in a\\n\\nprotected class. Title VII provides redress for employment discrimination based on\\n\\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2; see also\\n\\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800-02 (1973). Warren does\\n\\nnot, however, allege discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national\\n\\norigin. Thus, he fails to sufficiently allege a discrimination claim.2\\n\\n       Although Warren filed his claim under Title VII, his argument really\\n\\ninvolves an alleged breach of contract claim in which he contends that the\\n\\n\\n       2\\n         Notably, the complaint form that Warren used to file his lawsuit enabled him to identify\\nwhether his claim was based on discrimination on account of race, religion, sex, and\/or national\\norigin. Warren did not select any of these categories. Even if we were to assume that his\\ncomplaint sufficiently alleged a discrimination claim, his Title VII claim fails for another reason;\\nhe did not exhaust his administrative remedies. As a prerequisite to filing a Title VII suit, an\\nemployee must file a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity\\nCommission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) within the statutory time period. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b),(f); Wilkerson\\nv. Grinell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir. 2001). Warren failed to do so, thus barring any\\nTitle VII claim he may have had. See Wilkerson, 270 F.3d at 1317.\\n\\n                                                 4\\n\\x0cdefendants failed to pay into the pension as required by the contract.3 Any breach\\n\\nof contract claim that Warren may have, however, is preempted by the\\n\\nEmployment Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (\u201cERISA\u201d). 29\\n\\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a); Hobbs v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama, 276 F.3d 1236,\\n\\n1240 (11th Cir. 2001); see also Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 52-54\\n\\n(1987).\\n\\n       Therefore, Warren\u2019s only appropriate avenue of relief was to seek benefits\\n\\ndue under the plan pursuant to ERISA. The problem for Warren is that any ERISA\\n\\nclaim he may have had is now barred by the statute of limitations. In an ERISA\\n\\naction, we apply the limitations period from the state in which the action is\\n\\nbrought. Harrison v. Digital Health Plan, 183 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir. 1999).\\n\\nBecause this action was brought in Georgia, the applicable statute of limitations is\\n\\nsix years. Id. at 1241; O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-3-24. In addition, a cause of action accrues\\n\\nwhen the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury. Bowling v.

Dr. Christine Leitgen sued\\nher former employer, Franciscan Skemp Healthcare\\n(\u201cthe Hospital\u201d), under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\\nof 1964, claiming as relevant here that it retaliated\\nagainst her by forcing her to resign after she com-\\nplained that its compensation scheme unlawfully under-\\npaid physicians based on gender. The Hospital pools\\nrevenue received for childbirth deliveries and redistrib-\\n\\x0c2                                               No. 09-1496\\n\\nutes the receipts equally among all physicians in the\\nobstetrics department, but Leitgen advocated for a\\nsystem that would pay physicians on a per-delivery\\nbasis. The district court granted summary judgment for\\nthe Hospital. We affirm.\\n\\n\\n                             I.\\n  Leitgen began working as a physician in the Hospital\u2019s\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1993.\\nThe number of doctors in the group fluctuated with\\ntime, but when Leitgen joined she became the fourth\\nphysician and second woman in the group. Over the\\nyears Leitgen developed her practice and became one of\\nthe department\u2019s most in-demand and highest paid\\ndoctors, frequently performing more than 100 deliveries\\nper year. In January 1999, the department appointed her\\nto serve as chairperson, and in 2002 it reappointed her to\\na second term. Leitgen stepped down before her second\\nterm expired, however, to dedicate more time to her\\nclinical practice, and after about a year of interim leader-\\nship, the Hospital eventually hired Dr. Edward Sandy\\nin August 2004 to serve as the department\u2019s new chair.\\n\\n\\n                            A.\\n  Throughout Leitgen\u2019s employment, the Hospital billed\\npregnant women for a package of services that included\\nboth prenatal care and delivery. And although the\\nHospital compensated the patient\u2019s primary physician\\ndirectly for providing prenatal services, it pooled the\\n\\x0cNo. 09-1496                                            3\\n\\nrevenue generated from the delivery and redistributed\\nit equally among the physicians in the group. Because\\nof this policy of sharing delivery revenue, the doctors\\nwho performed the most deliveries\u2014regardless of\\ngender\u2014received less payment than they would under\\na system where each doctor was paid purely for\\nservices rendered.\\n  At several points during Leitgen\u2019s employment, she\\nand other female physicians expressed concern that,\\nbecause each woman in the practice had a larger patient\\nbase and thus tended to perform more deliveries than\\neach man, the Hospital\u2019s policy of pooling delivery reve-\\nnue meant that the women were unfairly compensated\\nfor their birthing services. Between 1993 and 1999, even\\nthough her salary was one of the highest in her group,\\nLeitgen complained numerous times about the pay struc-\\nture to the then-chair of the department. At one point\\nthe chair raised the issue with the Hospital\u2019s compensa-\\ntion committee and learned that any change would\\nhave to be made within the department. No change was\\nmade after these initial inquiries.\\n  The female physicians again raised the issue during\\nLeitgen\u2019s tenure as chair. At that point it remained\\nunclear whether a change required a unanimous vote of\\nthe department, but regardless, Leitgen did not try to\\nmodify the system because the female doctors in the\\ngroup feared that a change would adversely affect the\\ndepartment\u2019s morale. In 2003, one of the department\u2019s\\nother female physicians, Dr. Karen Keil, complained again\\nto Leitgen about the compensation setup, pointing out\\n\\x0c4                                            No. 09-1496\\n\\nthat because she and Leitgen currently performed more\\ndeliveries than anyone else in the group, the system\\nwas most detrimental to them. When Sandy became the\\ndepartment chair, both Keil and Leitgen informed him\\nthat they thought the compensation system was unfair\\nto them, both as women and as high-volume physicians.\\n(The parties dispute whether Leitgen and Keil framed\\ntheir problem with the compensation system as im-\\nplicating possible gender discrimination, but for pur-\\nposes of summary judgment we resolve that dispute\\nin Leitgen\u2019s favor.)\\n  In light of these complaints, the department\u2019s physi-\\ncians discussed compensation schemes several times.\\nWhen Sandy became chair, he put the issue on the\\nagenda for multiple department meetings and distrib-\\nuted scholarly work outlining different potential models\\nof compensation. Sandy also expressed a concern that\\npaying doctors based purely on their number of\\ndeliveries would tempt them to schedule medically\\nunnecessary inductions so that patients would give\\nbirth during a particular shift. At no point during any\\nof these discussions did Leitgen or any other doctor ask\\nfor a vote on the issue, and the shared-revenue arrange-\\nment remained in place.\\n  When Leitgen\u2019s intra-departmental complaints proved\\nunproductive, she took her concerns directly to Tom\\nTiggelaar, who was the secretary of the Hospital\u2019s com-\\npensation committee, the Hospital\u2019s vice president of\\nfinance, and the chief financial officer. On August 14,\\n2006, Leitgen emailed Tiggelaar requesting a meeting, and\\n\\x0cNo. 09-1496                                               5\\n\\nTiggelaar responded by speaking to Sandy about the\\nissue and by reaching out to other employees to\\nrequest statistics regarding Leitgen\u2019s production as com-\\npared to other members of the department. After\\nreceiving delivery statistics, Tiggelaar met with Leitgen\\non September 5, 2006, to discuss the matter. Leitgen\\ncomplained that the compensation system adversely\\naffected her pay and that she thought the pooling and\\nsharing of delivery revenues was discriminatory to\\nwomen. (The Hospital disputes that gender-based dis-\\ncrimination was part of this conversation, but again, we\\nassume for purposes of summary judgment that Leitgen\\ncommunicated the potential discriminatory import of\\nher concerns.) After the brief meeting, neither party\\nfollowed through on promises to resume their conversa-\\ntion. But, according to Tiggelaar, he reported \u201cthe essence\u201d\\nof the meeting to both Sandy and Diane Holmay (one\\nof Leitgen\u2019s supervisors) within a day or two. Leitgen\\nherself also informed Sandy that the meeting had taken\\nplace. According to Leitgen, Sandy was annoyed that\\nshe had taken her concerns outside of the department,\\nand their relationship suddenly soured after her meeting\\nwith Tiggelaar.\\n\\n\\n                            B.\\n  Although Leitgen generated substantial revenue on\\nbehalf of the Hospital, her time with the OB\/GYN depart-\\nment was marred by conflicts with patients and staff.\\nLeitgen takes issue with the way other staff members\\nperceived her behavior during these conflicts, but she\\n\\x0c6                                              No. 09-1496\\n\\nacknowledges that patients and nurses complained about\\nher communication style. Even though we construe the\\nfacts in Leitgen\u2019s favor, we need not ignore the undis-\\nputed fact that these unflattering complaints were made\\nby patients and staff. For example, in 2001 a nurse com-\\nplained that Leitgen chastised her about her perfor-\\nmance and stated that it was \u201ctypical of the poor nursing\\ncare\u201d in the department. The following year, a patient\\nexperiencing an ectopic pregnancy reported that Leitgen\\nrefused to treat her. Later in 2002, a different nurse con-\\nfronted Leitgen, telling her that members of the sup-\\nport staff found her demeanor condescending. In 2003,\\nLeitgen met with members of the Hospital\u2019s management\\nto discuss her combative communication with other\\nemployees, and after that meeting one of the managers\\nrecommended to Holmay that Leitgen be fired because\\nof her communication problems. But the Hospital\\ndid not fire Leitgen at that time, and the following year\\nshe and Holmay met with the same manager again to\\ndiscuss similar issues of teamwork and collaboration.\\nDuring that meeting Holmay confronted Leitgen about\\nnew incidents involving conduct that Holmay con-\\nsidered disruptive to patient safety and staff camaraderie.\\n  Even after these conversations with management\\nabout respectful communication, nurses continued to\\ntake issue with Leitgen\u2019s behavior, and they reported\\ntheir concerns to Bonnie Young, the director of the depart-\\nment\u2019s nursing staff. Here again, Leitgen disputes the\\nway her behavior was perceived by the staff involved,\\nbut admits that she received multiple oral warnings\\nbetween 2004 and 2006 that her communication with the\\n\\x0cNo. 09-1496                                             7\\n\\nsupport staff was problematic. For example, Leitgen\\nacknowledges that at least two nurses told Young that\\nthey refused to continue working in the department\\nbecause of the way Leitgen had treated them.\\n  Despite these continued communication problems, in\\nher performance evaluation in March 2006, both Sandy\\nand Holmay identified positive contributions that\\nLeitgen made to the department. They told Leitgen that\\nshe had shown some improvement in her interactions\\nwith support staff and was an asset to the Hospital.\\nSandy also asked Leitgen to serve on the recruiting com-\\nmittee, and he invited her to represent the department\\nat a conference at the end of the year. As of March 2006,\\nboth Holmay and Sandy agreed that Leitgen faced no\\nrisk of termination.\\n  But four months after this performance evaluation,\\nnurses began to renew their complaints about Leitgen.\\nIn July 2006, Young reported to Sandy that another\\nnurse, Wendy Stone, had complained that Leitgen had\\nhumiliated and verbally abused her in front of a patient.\\n(Leitgen admits to having made comments that upset\\nStone in front of a patient but contends that the com-\\nments were justified by Stone\u2019s performance.) The same\\nday that Sandy learned of the incident he wrote the first\\nof a number of emails to Holmay about the possibility\\nof disciplining Leitgen. In this email, Sandy said that he\\nhad tolerated Leitgen because she added value to the\\ndepartment, but he also commented that her behavior\\ncould not \u201cgo on forever.\u201d After meeting with Stone to\\ndiscuss the incident, Sandy sent another email to Holmay\\n\\x0c8                                             No. 09-1496\\n\\nstating that they needed to meet in person because, upon\\nreflection, he believed that Leitgen\u2019s interpersonal con-\\nflicts were more serious than he had previously under-\\nstood. Both Stone\u2019s complaint and Sandy\u2019s decision\\nto explore discipline against Leitgen occurred more\\nthan a month before Leitgen met with Tiggelaar in early\\nSeptember 2006 to complain about the compensation\\nsystem.\\n  Leitgen\u2019s deteriorating relationship with nursing\\nstaff and patients continued throughout September. For\\nexample, while Leitgen was in the middle of a delivery,\\na nurse called asking for assistance with a non-urgent\\nmatter. Leitgen could not take the call herself, but she\\ntold the person relaying the message to \u201cgo hit\u201d the\\nnurse who had requested assistance. Leitgen later testi-\\nfied that she had meant this comment facetiously, but\\nshe admitted that some people in the room apparently\\ndid not take it as a joke. That same month a patient com-\\nplained that Leitgen had blamed her for the difficulties\\nthat had arisen during her emergency Caesarean sec-\\ntion. And around the same time, Young received two\\nadditional complaints from staff members about Leitgen:\\na nurse complained that she had been belittled, and a\\nmidwife reported that she was unable to build a collabora-\\ntive practice with Leitgen. Young did not notify Leitgen\\nabout either of these incidents or complaints.\\n  During September (the exact date is uncertain), while\\nshe was still serving on the recruiting committee, Leitgen\\nalso made comments that members of the Hospital\\nviewed as disloyal to its recruiting mission. Leitgen told\\n\\x0cNo. 09-1496                                              9\\n\\na doctor that the department was recruiting that she felt\\nher ideas were not heard, that she had little respect for\\nthe nursing staff, and that she felt unhappy at the Hospi-\\ntal. In the course of that conversation, Leitgen told the\\nrecruit that she would not have joined the Hospital\\n\u201cknowing what she knows now\u201d and that she might\\nbe gone by the time he arrived. After this conversation\\nwith Leitgen, the recruit contacted Sandy and expressed\\na concern about accepting a position with the Hospital\\nbecause he feared that the physicians were unhappy.\\n\\n\\n                            C.\\n   By early September 2006, having decided the previ-\\nous month to discipline Leitgen for her abuse of staff,\\nSandy and Holmay began preparing a recommendation\\nthat Leitgen be terminated. They met with a member of\\nthe management committee to determine what docu-\\nments they would need, and shortly after this meeting,\\nHolmay asked Young to prepare a timeline listing in-\\nstances where nurses or patients had reported that\\nLeitgen was either rude or disruptive. Young prepared a\\nfirst draft of this timeline by September 8, 2006, based on\\nunofficial, private notes that she kept regarding conflicts\\nbetween staff members. Although Young memorialized\\ncomplaints from nurses regarding interactions with\\ndoctors and other staff in these notes, she did not, as a\\ngeneral rule, investigate the incidents or take note of\\nopposing viewpoints. Holmay and Sandy had been ex-\\nchanging emails about disciplining Leitgen since at least\\nJuly 2006, but before September 2006 no one had been\\n\\x0c10                                            No. 09-1496\\n\\ngathering documentation about Leitgen \u201cfor the pur-\\nposes of termination.\u201d In addition to requesting\\nthe timeline, Sandy began excluding Leitgen from con-\\nversations about recruiting and told her that she would\\nno longer be representing the Hospital at the upcoming\\nconference. Sandy did not inform Leitgen that she was\\nin jeopardy of being fired.\\n  On October 31, 2006, Sandy formally recommended to\\nthe Hospital\u2019s executive committee that it terminate\\nLeitgen. He supported his recommendation with the\\nfollowing documentation: personal letters from both\\nhim and Holmay, Young\u2019s timeline, and a separate\\ntimeline created by Holmay. Through these documents\\nand their personal statements to the committee, both\\nSandy and Holmay expressed their opinion that, although\\nLeitgen was an amply qualified physician, her hostility\\ntoward staff and patients was unacceptable. In addition\\nto these concerns, one of the members of the executive\\ncommittee emphasized that he was dissatisfied by the\\nnegative comments Leitgen had made recently to the\\nphysician the Hospital had been trying to recruit. After\\nhearing recommendations from Sandy and Holmay, the\\ncommittee voted to fire Leitgen.\\n   On November 14, 2006, Leitgen attended a \u201ctermination\\nsession\u201d where members of the executive committee\\ntold her that she could either resign or be fired. Leitgen\\nquit the following day. Holmay attended the meeting\\nwith two other hospital administrators, but Sandy was\\nabsent. At the meeting, the Hospital told Leitgen that\\nit was terminating her because of the numerous com-\\n\\x0cNo. 09-1496                                                  11\\n\\nplaints that nurses and patients had made against her\\nover the years. In discharging Leitgen, the Hospital\\nelected not to follow its policy recommending that it\\nnotify employees in writing of potential disciplinary\\nactions resulting from disruptive behavior.\\n  The district court granted summary judgment for the\\nHospital. It bypassed the question whether Leitgen\u2019s\\ncomplaints regarding the compensation system were\\nprotected conduct and concluded that, even if they quali-\\nfied, no reasonable jury could find a causal connection\\nbetween Leitgen\u2019s complaints and her forced resignation.\\nThe court found it significant that Leitgen had been\\ncomplaining about the compensation system for years,\\nbut the Hospital did not force her to resign until after\\na flurry of complaints from nurses regarding her conduct.\\n\\n\\n                              II.\\n  On appeal, Leitgen relies exclusively on the direct\\nmethod of proof to argue that genuine issues of material\\nfact prevent summary judgment for the Hospital. To\\nsurvive summary judgment on her retaliation claim\\nunder the direct method, Leitgen needed to provide\\nsufficient direct or circumstantial evidence to establish\\n(1) that she engaged in protected conduct, (2) that she\\nsuffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that there\\nwas a causal connection between the two. See Jones v.\\nRes-Care, Inc., 613 F.3d 665, 671 (7th Cir. 2010); Casna v. City\\nof Loves Park, 574 F.3d 420, 426 (7th Cir. 2009). There is\\nno dispute that Leitgen\u2019s forced resignation constitutes\\nan adverse employment action, so we are left with the\\n\\x0c12                                                No. 09-1496\\n\\nquestions whether Leitgen engaged in protected conduct\\nand whether that conduct was causally connected to\\nher forced resignation. The district court bypassed the\\nissue of protected conduct, but because Leitgen focuses\\non her conversation with Tiggelaar as the applicable\\nprotected conduct and that conversation is relevant to\\nthe question of causation, we begin our analysis there.\\n\\n\\n                              A.\\n  For Leitgen to show that she engaged in protected\\nconduct, she had to prove that she had a reasonable,\\ngood-faith belief that the compensation system was\\ndiscriminatory when she complained about it, but she\\nneed not prove that the system was actually discrim-\\ninatory such that she would have prevailed on a claim\\nof intentional discrimination under Title VII. See Tate v.\\nExec. Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 546 F.3d 528, 532 (7th Cir. 2008);\\nFine v. Ryan Int\u2019l Airlines, 305 F.3d 746, 752 (7th Cir. 2002).\\nOur requirement that Leitgen have a reasonable, good-\\nfaith belief that her complaint involved gender discrim-\\nination is not onerous. See Mattson v. Caterpillar, Inc., 359\\nF.3d 885, 892 (7th Cir. 2004). She simply had to show that\\nher belief that she was complaining about unlawful\\ndiscrimination was not \u201c \u2018completely groundless.\u2019 \u201d See\\nFine, 305 F.3d at 752 (quoting McDonnell v. Cisneros, 84\\nF.3d 256, 259 (7th Cir. 1996)).\\n  In her appellate brief, Leitgen acknowledges the Hospi-\\ntal\u2019s argument that she never engaged in protected\\nconduct but responds that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision\\nin Crawford v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson Cnty.,\\n\\x0cNo. 09-1496                                             13\\n\\n129 S. Ct. 846 (2009), establishes that her complaints were\\nprotected. Crawford addressed only whether cooperating\\nwith an employer\u2019s internal investigation of discrim-\\nination was protected conduct, id. at 850-51, and is\\nnot dispositive here. Instead, the question here is\\nwhether Leitgen reasonably believed that her com-\\nplaints about the compensation system amounted to\\nmore than a gender-neutral accusation that the system\\nunfairly penalized her as a high-volume physician and\\ninstead charged gender discrimination.\\n  Title VII, of course, prohibits discriminatory compensa-\\ntion based on gender, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1);\\nGoodman v. Nat\u2019l Sec. Agency, Inc., 621 F.3d 651, 656 (7th\\nCir. 2010). The Hospital recognizes that a disparity\\nin pay based on gender would violate Title VII, but\\nargues that Leitgen lacked an objectively reasonable\\nbelief that the Hospital\u2019s pay system intentionally dis-\\ncriminated against women. The Hospital supports its\\nposition by pointing out that the compensation system\\nhad remained the same throughout Leitgen\u2019s employ-\\nment, that Leitgen did not try to change the system\\nduring her tenure as department chair, and that the\\nHospital justified the pay scheme with the nondiscrim-\\ninatory interest in discouraging elective inductions.\\nBut these reasons do not undermine the sincerity or\\nreasonableness of Leitgen\u2019s complaint that she believed\\nthe Hospital\u2019s pay scheme to be discriminatory based\\non gender. Throughout her opposition to summary judg-\\nment, Leitgen has repeatedly pointed to evidence that\\nshe has always framed her complaints as a potential\\nissue of gender discrimination. Moreover, the ongoing\\n\\x0c14                                             No. 09-1496\\n\\nnature of her complaints during her tenure, and her\\ntolerance of the system while she was chair, do not con-\\nclusively show that her complaints about the pay\\nsystem were unreasonable or insincere. Instead, these\\nfacts suggest that the impediments to changing the com-\\npensation system at the Hospital were significant and\\nenduring. Thus, we credit Leitgen\u2019s contention for pur-\\nposes of summary judgment that her conversation\\nwith Tiggelaar was protected conduct. We note, however,\\nthat Leitgen\u2019s focus on her conversation with Tiggelaar\\nas the particular instance of protected conduct that\\ncaused her termination is relevant to the issue of causal\\nconnection.\\n\\n\\n                            B.\\n  Leitgen next argues that she presented sufficient evi-\\ndence that the Hospital\u2019s decision to fire her was\\nmotivated by her complaints about the compensation\\nsystem, particularly her conversation with Tiggelaar. To\\nestablish a causal connection between her allegedly\\nprotected conduct and her forced resignation, Leitgen\\nhad to show that her complaints were \u201ca substantial or\\nmotivating factor\u201d in the Hospital\u2019s decision to fire her.\\nSee Gates v. Caterpillar, Inc., 513 F.3d 680, 686 (7th Cir.\\n2008) (citation and quotation omitted). Leitgen points to\\ncircumstantial evidence that, in her view, shows that the\\nHospital based its decision, at least in part, on her com-\\nplaints about the compensation system. We address her\\nevidence and, like the district court, conclude that the\\ninferences Leitgen attempts to draw from it are too at-\\n\\x0cNo. 09-1496                                               15\\n\\ntenuated to survive summary judgment when con-\\nsidered individually or together.\\n  Leitgen relies most heavily on the temporal proximity\\nbetween her conversation with Tiggelaar and her forced\\nresignation. As we have often observed, suspicious\\ntiming alone is almost always insufficient to survive\\nsummary judgment. Leonard v. E. Ill. Univ., 606 F.3d 428,\\n432-33 (7th Cir. 2010); Turner v. Saloon, Ltd., 595 F.3d 679,\\n687 (7th Cir. 2010). Leitgen nonetheless contends that\\nthis case is the exception because Sandy and Holmay\\nbegan preparing for her termination just days after her\\nmeeting with Tiggelaar. See Casna, 574 F.3d at 427 (finding\\nthat suspicious timing created triable issue where em-\\nployee was terminated one day after protected conduct);\\nSpiegla v. Hull, 371 F.3d 928, 943 (7th Cir. 2004) (four days\\nlater); McClendon v. Indiana Sugars, Inc., 108 F.3d 789, 796-\\n97 (7th Cir. 1997) (two or three days later). After re-\\nviewing the evidence, we find that Leitgen cannot over-\\ncome the general rule that suspicious timing alone is\\ninsufficient to support a claim of retaliation.\\n   First, Leitgen\u2019s conversation with Tiggelaar was not the\\nfirst time that she complained about the compensation\\nsystem. To the contrary, she first pursued this issue\\nwith the department years before the Hospital fired her.\\nWhen an employee\u2019s protected conduct is separated by\\na significant period of time from the adverse employ-\\nment action, the proximity of the incidents does not\\nsupport a causal connection between them. See Leonard,\\n606 F.3d at 432 (finding adverse employment action six\\nmonths after protected conduct insufficient to establish\\n\\x0c16                                               No. 09-1496\\n\\nretaliation claim); Argyropoulos v. City of Alton, 539 F.3d\\n724, 734 (7th Cir. 2008) (seven weeks between events).\\n  Leitgen responds that her complaints were ongoing\\nup until September 2006, and therefore a large time gap\\ndoes not separate her protected conduct from her dis-\\ncharge. But this response misses the point. Because she\\nhad been complaining to hospital executives about the\\npay system for years, she must offer a valid reason why\\nher conversation with Tiggelaar would suddenly trigger\\nretaliation. She proposes one reason: It was the first\\ntime she raised her concern to anyone outside the de-\\npartment. But this assertion is incorrect. Leitgen testified\\nthat, with the help of the then-chair of the department,\\nshe raised these concerns with the compensation com-\\nmittee (who are people outside the department) sometime\\nbefore she herself became chair in 1999. Even though\\nthese extra-departmental complaints occurred before\\nSandy came to the Hospital, Leitgen admitted that both\\nSandy and Holmay\u2014the executives who recommended\\nher termination\u2014knew of her concerns about the com-\\npensation system years before the Hospital forced her\\nto resign. A claim of retaliation based on suspicious\\ntiming depends on what the relevant decision-makers\\nknew and when, see Salas v. Wis. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 493 F.3d 913,\\n925 (7th Cir. 2007); Tomanovich v. City of Indianapolis, 457\\nF.3d 656, 668 (7th Cir. 2006), and here the evidence\\nshows that the relevant decision-makers knew of\\nLeitgen\u2019s belief that the compensation system was dis-\\ncriminatory long before they decided to terminate her.\\n  Leitgen\u2019s reliance on her conversation with Tiggelaar\\nas the protected conduct that caused her termination is\\n\\x0cNo. 09-1496                                              17\\n\\nalso flawed because Sandy and Holmay had begun dis-\\ncussing ways to discipline Leitgen before that meeting\\never took place. Sandy and Holmay exchanged emails\\nabout how best to discipline Leitgen after she belittled\\nNurse Stone in front of a patient in July 2006, weeks\\nbefore Leitgen wrote to Tiggelaar to request a meeting\\nand more than a month before that meeting occurred.\\nWhen a retaliation claim is based on suspicious timing,\\n\u201cthe order of events is even more important than the\\ntime between them; the theory doesn\u2019t work if the re-\\ntaliatory act precedes the protected activity.\u201d Leonard, 606\\nF.3d at 432. Here, although Leitgen asserts that there is\\na dispute of fact, the evidence is conclusive that Sandy\\nand Holmay had decided to consider various disciplinary\\nresponses to Leitgen\u2019s disruptive behavior well before\\nshe engaged in the allegedly protected conduct of talking\\nto Tiggelaar. And Holmay\u2019s admission that no one had\\nbegun gathering documentation to support the recom-\\nmendation for Leitgen\u2019s termination until Septem-\\nber 2006 does not refute the undisputed evidence that\\nSandy and Holmay had already decided to pursue some\\ntype of discipline against Leitgen well before she ever\\nmet with Tiggelaar.\\n  Leitgen next argues that the Hospital\u2019s sudden creation\\nof a timeline of her \u201cunacceptable behavior\u201d just three\\ndays after her meeting with Tiggelaar is suspicious\\nenough to overcome summary judgment. Although a\\nretaliation claim can be supported by evidence of \u201csudden\\ndissatisfaction with an employee\u2019s performance,\u201d particu-\\nlarly when an employee has a generally good record,\\nCulver v. Gorman & Co., 416 F.3d 540, 546 (7th Cir. 2005),\\n\\x0c18                                             No. 09-1496\\n\\nthe evidence in this case belies that characterization.\\nLeitgen refers us to her \u201coutstanding\u201d performance\\nevaluation in March 2006, but in that evaluation, Sandy\\nand Holmay told her that her interpersonal relationships\\nhad merely \u201cimproved.\u201d In any event, Sandy and Holmay\\ndid not suddenly become dissatisfied with Leitgen\u2019s\\nbehavior after she met with Tiggelaar; the evidence\\nshows that they both considered her behavior to be prob-\\nlematic before the meeting, and they were already in\\nthe midst of devising methods to respond when she\\nrequested the meeting. The undisputed evidence also\\nestablishes that Holmay had been dissatisfied with\\nLeitgen\u2019s interpersonal flaws for a long time, so much so\\nthat she participated in meetings with administrators\\nthree years earlier that had resulted in a recommenda-\\ntion that Leitgen be fired.\\n  Leitgen also faults the Hospital for creating and relying\\non a timeline that was not based on pre-existing docu-\\nments and for failing to comply with its policy recom-\\nmending written warnings of unacceptable behavior. The\\nHospital\u2019s policy favors, but does not require, the\\nwritten notice that Leitgen claims she never received. By\\nLeitgen\u2019s own admission, she learned of many of the\\ncomplaints against her when she was orally warned\\nabout her behavior. And she does not deny that she\\nattended multiple meetings with Hospital administrators\\nwhere they notified her of their problems with her\\nattitude toward coworkers. Given that Leitgen admits\\nthat she attended disciplinary meetings and received oral\\nwarnings, the Hospital\u2019s neglect to follow its recom-\\nmended policy of documenting those discussions is not\\nevidence of retaliation.\\n\\x0cNo. 09-1496                                               19\\n\\n  Finally, Leitgen argues that the Hospital also retaliated\\nagainst Keil, another female physician, by forcing her\\nto quit after she complained that the pay system dis-\\ncriminated against her as a woman. This treatment,\\nLeitgen urges, further supports her claim of retaliation.\\nAlthough the Hospital\u2019s discrimination against other\\nemployees who raised similar complaints would be\\ncircumstantial evidence to support Leitgen\u2019s retaliation\\nclaim, see Hasan v. Foley & Lardner LLP, 552 F.3d 520, 527\\n(7th Cir. 2008); Troupe v. May Dep\u2019t Stores Co., 20 F.3d 734,\\n737 (7th Cir. 1994), Leitgen\u2019s reliance on Keil is\\nunavailing because the record contains no evidence that\\nthe Hospital did in fact discriminate against Keil.\\n  For the foregoing reasons, we therefore A FFIRM the\\njudgment of the district court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                           1-13-11\\n\\x0c', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 182782}]"},{"id":72630,"date_filed":"1998-02-26","judges":"Birch, Hill, Kravitch, Kravttch","case_name_full":"Billy Joe TURLINGTON and Ellen Jocile Turlington, Plaintiffs-Appellants, v.

Initially, he worked in\\n\\nAGL\\'s Information Systems Department (\"IS Department\"), where he rose to the position of\\n\\nSupervisor of Shift Operations. In February 1990, he was demoted to Class A Computer Operator\\n\\nfor failing to demonstrate job improvement during the prior year. Turlington presented evidence\\n\\nindicating that AGL, beginning in February 1990, denied him the same on-the-job training, practice\\n\\ntime, skill training, and software training that it provided to his younger co-workers. Although\\n\\nTurlington complained about the denial of training, his supervisors told him that he was incapable\\n\\nof learning new skills.2\\n\\n       On July 9, 1993, having received four consecutive below-acceptable annual performance\\n\\nevaluations, Turlington was transferred to the Display Department, where he worked constructing\\n\\nsigns manually. In an effort to block the transfer, Turlington submitted a written protest, which was\\n\\nprepared by a lawyer. The attorney also wrote AGL\\'s Chief Executive Officer stating that he was\\n\\nrepresenting Turlington \"for the discriminatory action taken against [Turlington] over the last\\n\\nseveral years culminating with his transfer.\"3 Turlington filed no discrimination charges with the\\n\\nEEOC at the time.\\n\\n\\n\\n   2\\n    Among the evidence presented by Turlington was the affidavit of Gary Boykin, an IS\\nDepartment employee with responsibility for training. Boykin confirmed that Turlington did not\\nreceive the same training as younger employees. Boykin also stated that Turlington\\'s supervisor,\\nEd Norwood, said \"that the younger employees were able to grasp the new technology faster and\\nbetter than the older employees such as Mr. Turlington.\" Affidavit of Boykin at 4-5. According\\nto Boykin, Turlington not only had the ability to learn but also used vacation time to develop his\\ncomputer skills.\\n   3\\n   Plaintiff\\'s Ex. 6 at 1. This lawyer, Ted B. Herbert, was one of the lawyers representing\\nTurlington in the district court proceedings in the instant case.\\n\\x0c       A year later, Turlington was still working in the Display Department when he applied for a\\n\\nClass C Computer Operator position in the IS Department.4 On October 12, 1994, Dale Kilpatrick,\\n\\nmanager of the IS Department, informed Turlington that he would not be considered for the position\\n\\nbecause of his previous performance in the IS Department. Turlington was 54 years old at the time.\\n\\n       On December 16, 1994, Turlington filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC alleging that\\n\\nAGL discriminated against him based on age by denying his application for the Class C Computer\\n\\nOperator position and subsequently hiring a 23-year-old man for that position.5 The accompanying\\n\\naffidavit stated that Turlington failed to obtain the job because his supervisors in the IS Department\\n\\ndid not provide the same technical training to Turlington as they did to his younger co-workers.\\n\\n       On January 4, 1995,6 the staff of the Display Department was told that the Display\\n\\nDepartment would be downsized to a single Display Coordinator. Later that month the Display\\n\\nCoordinator position was posted, and Turlington and two other candidates applied. After interviews\\n\\nand evaluations, a three-person panel rated each applicant, and based on these ratings, one of\\n\\nTurlington\\'s two competitors, a 44-year-old man, was selected for the position. On February 17,\\n\\n1995, Turlington amended his EEOC charge to incorporate his claim that AGL\\'s failure to select him\\n\\nas Display Coordinator was discriminatory. Turlington\\'s employment at AGL ended in March 1995.\\n\\n       In July 1995, the plaintiffs filed suit in federal district court alleging that the defendants: (1)\\n\\ndiscriminated against Turlington on the basis of his age in violation of the ADEA; (2) retaliated\\n\\n\\n\\n   4\\n   The Class C Computer Operator position is ranked lower than the Class A Computer\\nOperator position.\\n   5\\n    In his brief, Turlington states that he filed his EEOC charge on October 12, 1994, but the\\nrecord indicates otherwise.\\n   6\\n    Not at issue in this appeal is the fact that Turlington decided not to choose early retirement,\\nan option available to him from November 15, 1994, to January 3, 1995.\\n\\x0cagainst Turlington for filing an EEOC charge; (3) breached contractual obligations to Turlington\\n\\nin violation of Georgia law; (4) intentionally and\/or negligently inflicted emotional distress upon\\n\\nTurlington in violation of Georgia law; and (5) caused Mrs. Turlington\\'s loss of consortium under\\n\\nGeorgia law.\\n\\n       Turlington\\'s complaint alleged that AGL violated the ADEA in several ways, including: (1)\\n\\ndemoting him in February 1990; (2) failing to provide him adequate training from February 1990\\n\\nto July 1993, thus \"doom[ing][him] to poor performance\"7 and substandard evaluations; (3)\\n\\ntransferring him in July 1993; (4) refusing to hire him for the Class C Computer Operator position\\n\\nin October 1994; (5) refusing to hire him for the Display Coordinator position in 1995; and (6)\\n\\nthereafter discharging him.\\n\\n       Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which included a request for reasonable\\n\\nattorney\\'s fees. The district court dismissed plaintiffs\\' claims against defendants Curry and Miller;\\n\\ndeemed the retaliation, breach of contract, and emotional distress claims abandoned; dismissed the\\n\\nloss of consortium claim; granted summary judgment to AGL on the ADEA claim; and awarded\\n\\nattorney\\'s fees and costs to AGL. Turlington appeals the district court\\'s resolution of the ADEA\\n\\nclaim and the award of attorney\\'s fees.\\n\\n       On appeal, Turlington has narrowed significantly the basis of his ADEA allegations, arguing\\n\\nonly that AGL discriminated against him on the basis of age when it denied him the Class C\\n\\nComputer Operator position in October 1994. According to Turlington, that decision was\\n\\ndiscriminatory because it was based on Turlington\\'s poor evaluations in the IS Department, which\\n\\nin turn resulted from AGL\\'s discriminatory denial of training.\\n\\n                                                 II.\\n\\n\\n   7\\n    Complaint at 6, \u00b6 16.\\n\\x0c                                                 A.\\n\\n       This court reviews de novo a district court\\'s grant of summary judgment. We apply the same\\n\\nlegal standards that bound the district court and view all facts and any reasonable inferences\\n\\ntherefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Hale v. Tallapoosa County, 50\\n\\nF.3d 1579, 1581 (11th Cir.1995). Summary judgment is appropriate only when \"there is no genuine\\n\\nissue of material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\\n\\nFed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).\\n\\n        Where, as here, a plaintiff attempts to use circumstantial evidence to establish unlawful\\n\\ndiscrimination under the ADEA, this court employs the following burden-shifting scheme. Initially,\\n\\nthe plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The employer then must respond\\n\\nwith a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. In order to prevail, the plaintiff must\\n\\nestablish that the employer\\'s articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason was a pretext to mask\\n\\nunlawful discrimination. See Walker v. NationsBank of Fla. N.A., 53 F.3d 1548, 1556 (11th\\n\\nCir.1995).\\n\\n        In an ADEA case involving discharge, demotion, or failure to hire, a plaintiff may establish\\n\\na prima facie case by showing: (1) that he was a member of the protected group of persons between\\n\\nthe ages of forty and seventy; (2) that he was subject to adverse employment action; (3) that a\\n\\nsubstantially younger person filled the position that he sought or from which he was discharged;\\n\\nand (4) that he was qualified to do the job for which he was rejected. See O\\'Connor v. Consolidated\\n\\nCoin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 1310, 134 L.Ed.2d 433 (1996) (stating that\\n\\nan ADEA plaintiff must show that he was replaced by someone \"substantially younger,\" not\\n\\nnecessarily by someone under age 40); Jameson v. Arrow Co., 75 F.3d 1528, 1531 (11th Cir.1996)\\n\\n(listing elements of prima facie case). We apply this prima facie standard to Turlington\\'s claim that\\n\\x0cAGL discriminated by denying him the Class C Computer Operator position in 1994.\\n\\n        Although a plaintiff\\'s burden in proving a prima facie case is light, see Isenbergh v. Knight-\\n\\nRidder Newspaper Sales, Inc., 97 F.3d 436, 439 (11th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct.\\n\\n2511, 138 L.Ed.2d 1014 (1997), summary judgment against the plaintiff is appropriate if he fails to\\n\\nsatisfy any one of the elements of a prima facie case. For example, summary judgment is\\n\\nappropriate against a plaintiff who fails to demonstrate that he was qualified to perform the position\\n\\nfor which he was rejected. See Baker v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 903 F.2d 1515, 1520-21 (11th\\n\\nCir.1990) (per curiam) (holding that terminated plaintiff failed to make out prima facie case under\\n\\nthe ADEA; ruling that she was not qualified given her consistent failure to meet employer\\'s quota\\n\\nfor sale of maintenance agreements, a requirement of the position).\\n\\n                                                  B.\\n\\n       In granting summary judgment to AGL on Turlington\\'s ADEA claim, the district court held\\n\\nthat Turlington failed to establish a prima facie case. Citing Roberts v. Gadsden Mem\\'l Hosp., 835\\n\\nF.2d 793, 796 (11th Cir.), amended by 850 F.2d 1549 (1988), which addressed a Title VII claim\\n\\nrather than an ADEA claim, the district court stated that a plaintiff seeking to demonstrate a prima\\n\\nfacie case under the ADEA must demonstrate, inter alia, that \"a person outside of the plaintiff\\'s class\\n\\nwith equal or lesser qualifications was promoted, or the employer continued to seek applicants after\\n\\nthe plaintiff was rejected for the position.\"8 Then, focusing on AGL\\'s denial of the Display\\n\\nCoordinator position, the district court ruled that Turlington failed to establish a prima facie case\\n\\nbecause the three-person panel that rated the applicants deemed the successful candidate to be more\\n\\nqualified than Turlington.\\n\\n       Moreover, according to the district court, Turlington could not establish a prima facie case\\n\\n\\n   8\\n    Summary Judgment Order at 6.\\n\\x0cby arguing that he would have been as qualified as the successful candidate but for AGL\\'s allegedly\\n\\ndiscriminatory training practices. The district court ruled that such practices could not be used to\\n\\nestablish a prima facie case because they ended in July 1993, prior to 180 days before Turlington\\n\\nfiled charges with the EEOC in December 1994. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d)(1) (stating that an\\n\\nemployee claiming a violation of the ADEA must file charges with the EEOC not more than 180\\n\\ndays after the date of the allegedly unlawful practice).\\n\\n       On appeal, Turlington argues that the district court erred in two ways: first, by addressing\\n\\nonly AGL\\'s denial of the Display Coordinator position, not the denial of the Class C Computer\\n\\nOperator position, and second, by concluding that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d)(1) precluded Turlington from\\n\\nusing time-barred evidence to help establish a prima facie case. Abandoning all of his other\\n\\nallegations of ADEA violations, Turlington now argues only that he would have been qualified for\\n\\nthe Class C Computer Operator position absent AGL\\'s discriminatory training practices from\\n\\nFebruary 1990 to July 1993.\\n\\n                                                 C.\\n\\n        Although we disagree with some of the district court\\'s analysis, we nonetheless affirm the\\n\\ndistrict court\\'s grant of summary judgment to AGL on Turlington\\'s ADEA claim.9 We note that a\\n\\nplaintiff seeking to establish a prima facie case under the ADEA must show only that he was\\n\\nqualified to do the job for which he was rejected, see Jameson v. Arrow Co., 75 F.3d 1528, 1531\\n\\n(11th Cir.1996), and, unlike a Title VII plaintiff, need not show that a person outside of the\\n\\nplaintiff\\'s class with equal or lesser qualifications received the job, cf. Roberts v. Gadsden Mem\\'l\\n\\n\\n   9\\n    We may affirm the district court\\'s decision for reasons different than those stated by the\\ndistrict court. See Sec. & Exch. Comm\\'n v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459,\\n87 L.Ed. 626 (1943) (stating that the decision of the lower court must be affirmed if the result is\\ncorrect even though the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason), cited\\nin C.H. Robinson Co. v. Trust Co. Bank, N.A., 952 F.2d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir.1992).\\n\\x0cHosp., 835 F.2d 793, 796 (11th Cir.) (Title VII case), amended by 850 F.2d 1549 (1988). The\\n\\ndistrict court thus erred in ruling that Turlington, in establishing a prima facie case, had to show that\\n\\n\"a person outside of the plaintiff\\'s class with equal or lesser qualifications was promoted, or [that]\\n\\nthe employer continued to seek applicants after the plaintiff was rejected for the position.\" Summary\\n\\nJudgment Order at 6 (emphasis added).10\\n\\n        Because the district court primarily addressed AGL\\'s denial of the Display Coordinator\\n\\nposition, the district court did not squarely determine whether AGL\\'s denial of the Class C Computer\\n\\nOperator position was discriminatory. Upon reviewing this allegation, we hold that Turlington\\n\\nfailed to establish a prima facie case with regards to that adverse employment action. Turlington\\n\\ndoes not rebut the conclusion of Kilpatrick, the manager of the IS Department, who determined that,\\n\\nin light of Turlington\\'s prior poor performance in the IS Department, Turlington was not qualified\\n\\neven to be considered for the Class C Computer Operator position. Because he was rejected so early\\n\\nin the decisionmaking process, Turlington has failed to demonstrate his qualifications for the job.\\n\\nCf. Isenbergh v. Knight-Ridder Newspaper Sales, Inc., 97 F.3d 436, 440 (11th Cir.1996) (\"[B]ecause\\n\\nthe decisionmakers for [the employer] were familiar with [the employee\\'s] performance in his work\\n\\n... we can infer from the fact that he was granted an interview that [the employee] was at least at\\n\\nsome level qualified for the new job.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2511, 138 L.Ed.2d 1014\\n\\n(1997). Even though the requirements of a prima facie case are light, see id. at 439, Turlington has\\n\\n\\n\\n   10\\n     The district court also erred by implying that an ADEA plaintiff could not make out a prima\\nfacie case unless he were replaced by someone outside the protected age class. See O\\'Connor v.\\nConsolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 1310, 134 L.Ed.2d 433\\n(1996) (stating that an ADEA plaintiff must show that he was replaced by someone\\n\"substantially younger,\" not necessarily by someone under age 40). Furthermore, the district\\ncourt incorrectly stated that the question of whether \"the employer continued to seek applicants\\nafter the plaintiff was rejected for the position\" is relevant in determining if an ADEA plaintiff\\nhas established a prima facie case.\\n\\x0cfailed to meet this burden, see Baker v. Sears, Roebuck, & Co., 903 F.2d 1515, 1520-21 (11th\\n\\nCir.1990) (per curiam) (ruling that ADEA plaintiff was not qualified for her position and thus did\\n\\nnot establish a prima facie case).\\n\\n        Turlington contends that he would have been qualified for the Class C Computer Operator\\n\\nposition if he had received better training, and thus better evaluations, while working as a Class A\\n\\nComputer Operator in the IS Department between February 1990 and July 1993. We hold, however,\\n\\nthat the district court correctly ruled that Turlington could not use time-barred evidence of allegedly\\n\\ndiscriminatory training practices in order to establish a prima facie case. Two Supreme Court cases,\\n\\nUnited Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977), and Del. State\\n\\nCollege v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980), support the district court\\'s\\n\\nanalysis.11\\n\\n        In Evans, the Court expressly precluded plaintiffs from using time-barred discriminatory acts\\n\\nto establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination. The plaintiff in Evans was forced to\\n\\nresign in 1968 when she married in violation of the company\\'s policy of refusing to allow its female\\n\\nflight attendants to be married. 431 U.S. at 554, 97 S.Ct. at 1887. Although the plaintiff was rehired\\n\\nin 1972 after the policy was invalidated, she was not awarded seniority credit for her time off. Id.\\n\\nat 555, 97 S.Ct. at 1887. The Court held that the plaintiff could not attack the otherwise neutral\\n\\nseniority system merely by demonstrating that the system gave present effect to past discrimination.\\n\\n        [A] discriminatory act which occurred before the statute was passed ... may constitute\\n        relevant background evidence in a proceeding in which the status of a current practice is at\\n        issue, but separately considered, it is merely an unfortunate event in history which has no\\n        present legal consequences.... [S]uch a challenge to a neutral system may not be predicated\\n        on the mere fact that a past event which has no present legal significance has affected the\\n\\n\\n   11\\n     The ADEA 180-day limitations period, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d)(1), is quite similar to the\\nTitle VII limitations period, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1). Thus, although Evans and Ricks are\\nTitle VII cases, they provide clear guidance in the instant ADEA case.\\n\\x0c        calculation of seniority credit, even if the past event might at one time have justified a valid\\n        claim against the employer.\\n\\nId. at 558-60, 97 S.Ct. at 1889-90.\\n\\n        In Ricks, the Court extended Evans and held that a plaintiff challenging a facially neutral\\n\\nemployment termination decision cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination by\\n\\ndemonstrating that his termination gave effect to time-barred discriminatory acts.12 Explicitly\\n\\nrejecting the plaintiff\\'s \"continuing violation\" theory, see 449 U.S. at 257-58, 101 S.Ct. at 504-05,\\n\\nthe Court stated:\\n\\n        It is simply insufficient for [the employee] to allege that his termination gives present effect\\n        to the past illegal act and therefore perpetuates the consequences of forbidden\\n        discrimination. The emphasis is not upon the effects of earlier employment decisions;\\n        rather, it is upon whether any present violation exists.\\n\\nId. at 258, 101 S.Ct. at 504 (quoting Evans, 431 U.S. at 558, 97 S.Ct. at 1888) (internal quotations\\n\\nomitted) (emphasis in original).\\n\\n         In light of Evans and Ricks, Turlington failed to establish a prima facie case of\\n\\ndiscrimination. Turlington alleges that AGL\\'s denial of the Class C Computer Operator position in\\n\\nOctober 1994, although not discriminatory on its face, nonetheless violated the ADEA by giving\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   12\\n    The plaintiff in Ricks, after being denied tenure, received a one-year \"terminal\" contract.\\n449 U.S. at 252-53, 101 S.Ct. at 501. He only filed charges with the EEOC, however, near the\\nend of that contract. Id. at 254, 101 S.Ct. at 502. Because the denial of tenure occurred long\\nbefore the filing of the EEOC charge, the Court held that the plaintiff\\'s termination was facially\\nneutral.\\n\\n               [T]he only alleged discrimination occurred\u2014and the filing limitations period\\n               therefore commenced\u2014at the time the tenure decision was made and\\n               communicated to Ricks. That is so even though one of the effects of the denial of\\n               tenure\u2014the eventual loss of a teaching position\u2014did not occur until later....\\n\\n        Id. at 258, 101 S.Ct. at 504 (footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).\\n\\x0ceffect to past acts of discrimination that occurred from February 1990 to July 1993.13 Because\\n\\nplaintiffs may not use time-barred discriminatory acts to help establish a prima facie case of\\n\\ndiscrimination, see Evans, 431 U.S. at 558-60, 97 S.Ct. at 1889-90, evidence of AGL\\'s prior training\\n\\npractices cannot render discriminatory AGL\\'s facially neutral decision to deem Turlington\\n\\nunqualified for the Class C Computer Operator position, see Ricks, 449 U.S. at 258, 101 S.Ct. at\\n\\n504.14\\n\\n         We also reject the application of equitable tolling to this case. ADEA\\'s timing requirements\\n\\nmight have been equitably tolled if, in the period prior to the 180 days before filing the initial EEOC\\n\\ncharge, Turlington had no reason to believe he was a victim of unlawful discrimination. See Ross\\n\\nv. Buckeye Cellulose Corp., 980 F.2d 648, 660 (11th Cir.1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 814, 115 S.Ct.\\n\\n69, 130 L.Ed.2d 24 (1994).15 The evidence, however, indicates that Turlington, during his time as\\n\\n\\n   13\\n     The district court correctly found that the allegedly discriminatory training practices ended\\nin July 1993, more than 180 days before Turlington\\'s initial EEOC filing in December 1994.\\nAlthough the complaint does allege that Turlington was denied requests for computer training\\nwhile in the Display Department, the complaint does not state that this denial of training was\\ndiscriminatory.\\n   14\\n     Recent precedent in this circuit supports our determination that Turlington failed to present\\na \"continuing violation\" that would allow AGL\\'s liability to be premised on time-barred acts.\\nSee Calloway v. Partners Nat\\'l Health Plans, 986 F.2d 446, 448 (11th Cir.1993) (distinguishing\\nbetween \"the present consequence of a one time violation, which does not extend the limitations\\nperiod, and the continuation of the violation into the present, which does\") (quoting Beavers v.\\nAm. Cast Iron Pipe Co., 975 F.2d 792, 796 (11th Cir.1992)). No continuing violation existed\\nhere because AGL\\'s allegedly discriminatory training practices ended prior to 180 days before\\nTurlington filed charges with the EEOC. Cf. Reed v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 613 F.2d 757,\\n760, 762 (9th Cir.1980) (applying continuing violations theory where allegedly discriminatory\\npromotion, compensation, and training policies continued to exist during the 180-day time period\\nprior to the filing of the EEOC charge).\\n   15\\n     We need not address here all of the possible grounds for overlooking the ADEA\\'s timing\\nrequirements. Cf. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 1132,\\n71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982) (\"[F]iling a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a\\njurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of\\nlimitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling\").\\n\\x0ca Class A Computer Operator in the IS Department, protested vigorously against his failure to\\n\\nreceive the same training opportunities offered to his younger co-workers. Moreover, Turlington\\n\\nretained his district court counsel at least as of July 9, 1993, upon being transferred out of the IS\\n\\nDepartment. Under these circumstances, Turlington cannot rely on the theory of equitable tolling\\n\\nto preserve his right to hold AGL liable for discriminatory training practices.16 See McClinton v.\\n\\nAla. By-Products Corp., 743 F.2d 1483, 1487 (11th Cir.1984) (rejecting equitable tolling where\\n\\nADEA plaintiff \"suspects that he may have been discriminated against on account of age and is also\\n\\ngenerally aware of his legal right to obtain redress for that wrong\"). The ADEA\\'s limitations period\\n\\nthus bars Turlington from establishing a prima facie case based on evidence of AGL\\'s prior\\n\\ndiscrimination in training.\\n\\n                                                  D.\\n\\n        Turlington cites several cases purporting to demonstrate that he may establish a prima facie\\n\\ncase with the help of time-barred evidence of AGL\\'s discriminatory training practices. Turlington,\\n\\nhowever, fails to dispute the controlling authority of Evans and Ricks. Moreover, the cases he cites\\n\\n\\n\\n   16\\n      Turlington would have had an actionable claim under the ADEA for denial of training only\\nif, after filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC in a timely fashion, Turlington had\\nestablished that AGL denied material training opportunities to him on the basis of age. As this\\ncourt has held, the ADEA \"forbids far more than merely discriminatory discharge and hiring\\npractices.\" See Stamey v. S. Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 859 F.2d 855, 860 (11th Cir.1988), cert.\\ndenied, 490 U.S. 1116, 109 S.Ct. 3178, 104 L.Ed.2d 1040 (1989). The ADEA makes it illegal\\nfor employers \"to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate\\nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\\nemployment, because of such individual\\'s age.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). Discrimination with\\nrespect to training programs is thus actionable under the ADEA, see Kusak v. Ameritech Info.\\nSys., Inc., 80 F.3d 199, 201 (7th Cir.1996) (\"An employer might offer training programs,\\npromotion opportunities, or disability benefits to its employees, and the ADEA makes it clear\\nthat the employer may not condition access to those benefits on the age of the employee.\"), as\\nlong as the training is materially related to the employee\\'s job responsibilities or possibilities for\\nadvancement, cf. Crady v. Liberty Nat\\'l Bank & Trust Co. of Ind., 993 F.2d 132, 135-36 (7th\\nCir.1993) (stating that ADEA plaintiff must allege \"materially adverse employment action\").\\n\\x0care inapposite.\\n\\n       For example, four cases merely hold that a plaintiff can use evidence of time-barred\\n\\ndiscriminatory conduct to meet his burden of persuasion in a case involving circumstantial evidence\\n\\nof discrimination. See Allen v. County of Montgomery, 788 F.2d 1485, 1488 (11th Cir.1986);\\n\\nDowney v. S. Natural Gas Co., 649 F.2d 302, 304-05 (5th Cir. Unit B June 1981); Fisher v. Procter\\n\\n& Gamble Mfg. Co., 613 F.2d 527, 540 (5th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1115, 101 S.Ct. 929,\\n\\n66 L.Ed.2d 845 (1981); Mathewson v. Nat\\'l Automatic Tool Co., Inc., 807 F.2d 87, 91 (7th\\n\\nCir.1986). In none of these cases did the court hold that a plaintiff could use evidence of\\n\\ntime-barred conduct to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. To the contrary, in Taylor v.\\n\\nHudson Pulp & Paper Corp., 788 F.2d 1455, 1461-62 (11th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 953,\\n\\n108 S.Ct. 345, 98 L.Ed.2d 371 (1987), this court explicitly excluded time-barred conduct in\\n\\ndetermining that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\\n\\n       Turlington also relies on three disparate impact cases that are not applicable here. See\\n\\nWalker v. Jefferson County Home, 726 F.2d 1554 (11th Cir.1984); Crawford v. Western Elec. Co.,\\n\\nInc., 614 F.2d 1300, 1314 (5th Cir.1980); Gonzalez v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 610 F.2d 241\\n\\n(5th Cir.1980). In Walker, the plaintiff sued for failing to be selected for an employment position\\n\\nin 1974. 726 F.2d at 1557. The court held that the employer\\'s decision in 1974 was discriminatory,\\n\\nthough neutral on its face, because the decision was based on the plaintiff\\'s lack of supervisory\\n\\nauthority, which in turn resulted from the employer\\'s discriminatory decision in 1972 to deny the\\n\\nplaintiff a supervisory position.    Id. at 1558.     Recognizing that Evans, supra, would bar\\n\\nconsideration of the 1972 action in a disparate treatment case, the court deemed the 1972 action\\n\\nrelevant because Walker\\'s claim could be characterized as one of disparate impact. Id. at 1557 &\\n\\nn. 1. Like Walker, Crawford and Gonzalez also involved disparate impact claims. See Crawford,\\n\\x0c614 F.2d at 1314-1318; Gonzalez, 610 F.2d at 244, 249.\\n\\n        Turlington\\'s claim, however, is not based on disparate impact.17 To demonstrate disparate\\n\\nimpact, a plaintiff must demonstrate that an employer\\'s facially neutral practice or test had an\\n\\nadverse impact on a particular protected group. See Edwards v. Wallace Community College, 49\\n\\nF.3d 1517, 1520 (11th Cir.1995). Turlington does not allege that older workers as a class were\\n\\ndenied training, but only that he was denied training because of his age. Because Turlington\\'s case\\n\\nrelies solely on a disparate treatment theory, Evans and Ricks preclude him from using time-barred\\n\\ndiscriminatory acts to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. We thus affirm the district\\n\\ncourt\\'s grant of summary judgment against him.\\n\\n                                                 III.\\n\\n        Finally, we address the question of whether the district court erred in awarding attorney\\'s\\n\\nfees to AGL. After granting summary judgment to AGL, the district court issued a separate order\\n\\ngranting defendants reasonable attorney\\'s fees and costs and dismissing the action. The district court\\n\\nmade no findings in support of this order.18 The Turlingtons argue that the district court abused its\\n\\n\\n   17\\n     Because we rule that Turlington\\'s claim did not incorporate a disparate impact theory, we\\nneed not reach two additional issues: whether Walker is still valid law in light of Ross v.\\nBuckeye Cellulose Corp., 980 F.2d 648 (11th Cir.1993) (rejecting disparate impact claim\\nbecause freezing of compensation levels within 180 days of EEOC filing merely gave effect to\\nprior discriminatory pay and progression system and did not constitute continuing\\ndiscrimination), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 814, 115 S.Ct. 69, 130 L.Ed.2d 24 (1994), and whether\\nthe ADEA permits disparate impact claims. Neither this court nor the Supreme Court expressly\\nhas allowed disparate impact claims under the ADEA. See Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507\\nU.S. 604, 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 1706, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993) (reserving the issue). Compare\\nDistrict Council 37 v. New York City Dep\\'t of Parks and Recreation, 113 F.3d 347, 351 (2d\\nCir.1997) (holding that disparate impact theory is cognizable under ADEA), with EEOC v.\\nFrancis W. Parker Sch., 41 F.3d 1073, 1076-78 (7th Cir.1994) (suggesting that disparate impact\\ntheory is not cognizable under ADEA), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1142, 115 S.Ct. 2577, 132 L.Ed.2d\\n828 (1995).\\n   18\\n   Indeed, with the exception of a brief request for attorney\\'s fees in defendants\\' motion for\\nsummary judgment, the parties did not litigate the issue of attorney\\'s fees before the district\\n\\x0cdiscretion by awarding attorney\\'s fees to the prevailing defendants without having found that the\\n\\nTurlingtons litigated in bad faith.\\n\\n         We review de novo the legal basis of a district court\\'s decision to award attorney\\'s fees to\\n\\nprevailing defendants. Cf. Kreager v. Solomon & Flanagan, P.A., 775 F.2d 1541, 1542-43 (11th\\n\\nCir.1985). This circuit has not determined the circumstances under which a prevailing defendant\\n\\nmay obtain attorney\\'s fees in an ADEA case.\\n\\n         The ADEA incorporates selected provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\\n\\nincluding those pertaining to attorney\\'s fees. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b) (stating that attorney\\'s fees\\n\\nprovision of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b), applies to actions brought under the ADEA). Although\\n\\nthe attorney\\'s fees provision of the FLSA does not address whether, or under what circumstances,\\n\\nattorney\\'s fees should be awarded to a prevailing defendant, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b), this court has\\n\\nheld that the FLSA entitles a prevailing defendant to attorney\\'s fees only where the district court\\n\\nfinds that the plaintiff litigated in bad faith, see Kreager, 775 F.2d at 1542-43 (citing Alyeska\\n\\nPipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc\\'y, 421 U.S. 240, 258-59, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1622, 44 L.Ed.2d 141\\n\\n(1975) (stating that courts have the \"inherent power\" to assess attorney\\'s fees where a losing party\\n\\nhas \"acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons\")). Given the close\\n\\nrelationship between the ADEA and the FLSA, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b), we hold that a district court\\n\\nmay award attorney\\'s fees to a prevailing ADEA defendant only upon a finding that the plaintiff\\n\\nlitigated in bad faith. Several other circuits have so ruled. See EEOC v. Hendrix College, 53 F.3d\\n\\n209, 211 (8th Cir.1995); EEOC v. O & G Spring & Wire Forms Specialty Co., 38 F.3d 872, 883\\n\\n(7th Cir.1994); Gray v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co., 792 F.2d 251, 260 & n. 1 (1st Cir.1986);\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncourt.\\n\\x0cMorgan v. Union Metal Mfg., 757 F.2d 792, 796 (6th Cir.1985).19\\n\\n        Here, the district court made no findings whatsoever regarding the Turlingtons\\' bad faith in\\n\\nlitigating the case. On appeal, AGL points to several of the Turlingtons\\' litigation decisions as\\n\\nevidence of their bad faith. We believe, however, that an inquiry into a party\\'s bad faith is best\\n\\nconducted by the district court.20 We thus vacate the attorney\\'s fees award and remand the case to\\n\\nthe district court to decide whether the Turlingtons litigated in bad faith and to substantiate its\\n\\ndetermination with appropriate findings. See Kreager, 775 F.2d at 1543 (vacating and remanding\\n\\nwhere district court awarded attorney\\'s fees to prevailing defendant in FLSA case without making\\n\\nspecific findings of bad faith).\\n\\n\\n\\n   19\\n    This rule differs significantly from the rule governing the award of attorney\\'s fees to\\nprevailing defendants in Title VII cases. Title VII, unlike the ADEA and the FLSA, explicitly\\nauthorizes the award of attorney\\'s fees to \"the prevailing party.\" See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k).\\nThus, in Title VII cases, a district court \"may in its discretion award attorney\\'s fees to a\\nprevailing defendant ... upon a finding that the plaintiff\\'s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or\\nwithout foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\" Christiansburg Garment\\nCo. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).\\n   20\\n     Relying on Head v. Medford, 62 F.3d 351 (11th Cir.1995), AGL contends that this court\\nshould decide whether the Turlingtons litigated in bad faith. In Head, the district court granted\\nsummary judgment to the defendants on the plaintiff\\'s federal civil rights claims, but failed to\\naward attorney\\'s fees to the defendants. Id. at 353-55. A prevailing civil rights defendant is\\nentitled to attorney\\'s fees if the plaintiff\\'s claim was \"frivolous, unreasonable, or without\\nfoundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\" Id. at 355 (citation omitted)\\n(describing attorney\\'s fees statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988). The Head court held that the plaintiff\\'s\\nclaims were legally frivolous and that the defendants were entitled to attorney\\'s fees \"unless the\\ndistrict court points out special circumstances that justify making no award of fees.\" Id.\\n\\n                 This court\\'s limited remand in Head, however, is not relevant here. In contrast to\\n        the defendants in Head, prevailing defendants in ADEA cases are entitled to attorney\\'s\\n        fees only if the plaintiffs litigated in bad faith. We believe that the determination of bad\\n        faith is a complex inquiry that should be conducted initially by the district court, not an\\n        appellate court. See Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 767, 100 S.Ct. 2455,\\n        2465, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980) (ruling that the district court erred in awarding attorney\\'s\\n        fees to a prevailing defendant without making findings as to bad faith; directing that the\\n        case be returned to the district court to make appropriate findings).\\n\\x0cAFFIRMED IN PART.

For the reasons stated below, the Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.\\n\\nProcedural History\\nThe plaintiff, James L. Davis, filed an Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\")[1] in the Circuit Court for the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia, alleging fraud, constructive fraud, and undue influence against the defendants, and breach of contract against Old Dominion Tobacco Company, Inc. (\"Old Dominion\"). On December 9, 2009, the defendants removed the plaintiffs causes of action to this court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b), asserting that the plaintiffs breach of contract claim \"arises under\" a question of federal law, namely the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). On February 26, 2010, the court found that the plaintiffs breach of contract claim, Count VI of the Complaint, was completely preempted by ERISA, and was, therefore, properly removed to this court. Additionally, the court found that the plaintiffs state law tort claims were properly removed to this court under this court\\'s supplemental and pendent jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1367(a) and 1441(c), respectively. On March 8, 2010, the court found that all the plaintiffs claims were completely preempted by ERISA, and granted the plaintiff leave to amend the Complaint so that he could clarify his claims under ERISA, and raise all claims, as appropriate, for any purported violations of ERISA\\'s provisions.\\nOn March 26, 2010, the plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (\"Amended Complaint\"), stating causes of action under ERISA.[2] As in the Complaint, the plaintiff claims that his employer, defendant Old Dominion, fired him, at the behest of defendant Robin Ray (\"Ray\"), while he was disabled, in order to preclude him from collecting benefits purportedly due under an ERISA plan.[3] Accordingly, in Count I, the plaintiff seeks recovery of ERISA benefits, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) and (3); in Count II, the plaintiff states a claim for interference with rights protected by ERISA, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140; and, in Count III, the plaintiff states a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104 and 1109. On March 25, 2010, the plaintiff filed, as a separate cause of action in this court, a complaint (\"ADEA\/ADA Complaint\") stating causes of action arising under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\") and the American with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\").[4] In the *687 ADEA\/ADA Complaint, the plaintiff alleges the same factual background as he alleges in the Amended Complaint. In Count I, he states a claim for discrimination in violation of the ADEA, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 621 et seq. In Count II, he states a claim for discrimination in violation of the ADA, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq. On April 28, 2010, upon joint motion by all parties, the court consolidated the two actions, with both to proceed under Civil Action No. 2:09cv603.\\nOn May 21, 2010, the court denied the defendants\\' Motion to Dismiss Count I of the Amended Complaint, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On September 7, 2010, the defendants filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(b). On September 28, 2010, the plaintiff filed an untimely Response in Opposition (\"Response\"). On October 13, 2010, the court granted the plaintiff\\'s Motion for Leave to File his Response After the Expiration of the Specified Time, and on October 15, 2010, the defendants filed their Reply. The Motion for Summary Judgment is now ripe for review.\\n\\nFactual History\\nUnless otherwise noted, the following facts have been stipulated by the parties, see Final Pretrial Order, ECF No. 60, and\/or admitted.[5] The plaintiff was an employee of defendant Old Dominion for more than forty years. Defendant Robin Ray (\"Ray\") is a co-owner and President of Old Dominion, and is the plaintiff\\'s cousin. During the course of the plaintiff\\'s employment with Old Dominion, he was promoted to Vice President of the Beverage, CO2, and Vending Department. In 1992, after becoming Vice President, the plaintiff entered into a Deferred Compensation Agreement with Old Dominion (\"1992 Agreement\").[6] Under the 1992 Agreement, *688 the plaintiff (or designated beneficiary) was eligible to receive monthly benefit payments for 180 consecutive months upon: 1) retirement from Old Dominion at the age of sixty-five or older; 2) retirement due to permanent or indefinite disability; or 3) death, as long as he was employed by Old Dominion at the time of retirement or death. 1992 Agreement, Art. III(A)-(C), Am. Compl. Ex. 1, ECF No. 14-1. If the plaintiff sought to retire due to disability, he had to be deemed permanently or indefinitely disabled by a licensed physician chosen by Old Dominion. Id. at Art. I(A);[7]see also id. at Art. III(B). However, if the plaintiffs employment was terminated \"for any reason other than death, disability, or retirement at age 65,\" he would receive no benefits under the 1992 Agreement and the Agreement would become \"null and void.\" Id. at Art. III(D). Old Dominion was not required to fund the plan and the plaintiff did not \"have any lien nor right, title or interest in or to any specific funding investment or to any assets of [Old Dominion].\" Id. at Art. IV.[8]\\nIn 2006, the plaintiff began receiving treatment for various health problems, including depression and addictions to alcohol and pain medication.[9] The plaintiff confided in Ray about his health issues, and she met with him periodically to monitor his progress in dealing with his depression. Despite suffering from these health issues, the plaintiff never made any request to retire due to disability nor did he make any request for accommodations due to disability.[10] Similarly, the plaintiff never submitted any documentation regarding a disability or inability to work.[11] Old *689 Dominion never sought to initiate any procedures to determine the plaintiffs eligibility to retire with benefits under the 1992 Agreement. On September 16, 2008, Old Dominion fired the plaintiff and allegedly replaced him with his brother, Phillip Davis.[12] At the termination meeting, Old Dominion\\'s stated reason for firing the plaintiff was \"poor performance of [his] job and excessive unaccounted absent days from [his] job.\"[13]See Acknowledgment of Termination, Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 6, ECF No. 46-6,[14] At that time, the plaintiff was sixty-two years old.\\nOn September 18, 2010, the plaintiff met with Allen Patrick (\"Patrick\") of Old Dominion and they decided that the plaintiff should request a severance package of $85,020.00. Within two weeks of that meeting, the plaintiff and his wife spoke in person to his wife\\'s brother, an attorney, regarding the termination, the severance issues, and not receiving benefits under the 1992 Agreement.[15] On September 29, 2010, after meeting with his wife\\'s brother, the plaintiff entered into a Separation and Release Agreement with Old Dominion (\"2008 Document\"), which provided the plaintiff $72,000 in severance pay, in exchange for his release of any and all claims against, among others. Old Dominion and Ray, including any obligations under the 1992 Agreement and\/or any claims under the ADEA and ADA.[16] To date, he has *690 not tendered, either in whole or in part, the $72,000 back to Old Dominion.\\nIn Count I of the Amended Complaint, the plaintiff alleges that, at the time he was terminated, he was entitled to recover retirement benefits under the 1992 Agreement\\'s disability provisions in the total amount of $639,253.13, paid over the course of 180 months. In Count II, he alleges that the defendants interfered with his right to collect under the 1992 Agreement. Specifically, he alleges that the defendants fired him with the specific intent to interfere with his right to collect benefits due under the 1992 Agreement, and, prior to signing the 2008 Document, Old Dominion representatives did not inform him that the 1992 Agreement had a disability provision and that he was eligible to retire and receive retirement benefits. To the contrary, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants fraudulently induced him into signing the 2008 Document by falsely representing that he was not entitled to any benefits under the 1992 Agreement, and that only if he signed the 2008 Document would he receive any compensation. Moreover, the plaintiff contends that at the time he executed the 2008 Document, his mental conditions had worsened and diminished his ability to understand the effect of signing the 2008 Document. Finally, in Count III, the plaintiff alleges that Ray and the Old Dominion Board of Directors are fiduciaries under ERISA, charged with the duty to ensure that the plaintiff receive disability benefits he may be entitled to under the 1992 Agreement; to inform the plaintiff that he may qualify for such benefits; and to inform him how to apply for and gain access to such benefits. The plaintiff argues that they breached that duty when they failed to inform him he may qualify for disability benefits under the 1992 Agreement, fired him with knowledge that he was disabled, and fraudulently procured the 2008 Document. In all three counts, the plaintiff requests that the court enter an Order declaring the 2008 Document null and void.\\nIn Count I of the ADEA\/ADA Complaint, the plaintiff alleges that Old Dominion discriminated against him on account of his age by terminating him on the basis of his age and health before he had attained the age of retirement and while he had a disability. The plaintiff also claims that he was treated differently than other similarly situated younger employees and was replaced by a younger, less qualified employee. In Count II, the plaintiff alleges that Old Dominion discriminated against him on account of his disability by terminating his employment and refusing to make reasonable accommodations for him. He also claims that he was treated differently than other, non-disabled employees and that Old Dominion gave his job to a younger employee who was not disabled.\\n\\nStandard of Review\\nSummary judgment is appropriate when a court, viewing the record as a whole and in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Terry\\'s Floor Fashions, Inc. v. Burlington Indus., Inc., 763 F.2d 604, 610 (4th Cir. 1985). A party opposing a motion for summary judgment may not rest on the pleadings alone, but must instead show that \"specific, material facts exist that give *691 rise to a genuine triable issue.\" Hagan v. McNallen (In re McNallen), 62 F.3d 619, 623-24 (4th Cir.1995). In essence, the nonmovant must present evidence \"on which a [trier of fact] could reasonably find\" for the nonmoving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505. Such facts must be presented in the form of exhibits and sworn affidavits. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); see also M &amp; M Med. Supplies &amp; Serv., Inc. v. Pleasant Valley Hosp., Inc., 981 F.2d 160, 163 (4th Cir. 1993) (\"A motion for summary judgment may not be defeated by evidence that is `merely colorable\\' or `is not sufficiently probative.\\'\" (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505)).\\nOn summary judgment, the court is not to \"weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter.\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505. Instead, the court will draw any permissible inference from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587-88, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). But a failure by a plaintiff to rebut a defendant\\'s motion with sufficient evidence will result in summary judgment when appropriate. \"[T]he plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment ... against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\\'s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\" Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548; see also Felty v. Graves-Humphreys Co., 818 F.2d 1126, 1128 (4th Cir.1987) (finding district courts have an \"affirmative obligation ... to prevent `factually unsupported claims and defenses\\' from proceeding to trial.\" (citing Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323-24, 106 S. Ct. 2548)).\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nI. Separation and Release Agreement\\nBefore the court can address the substance of the Amended Complaint and the ADEA\/ADA Complaint, it must determine whether the plaintiff adduces enough evidence to establish that the 2008 Document should not be enforced. The court addresses this issue first because the 2008 Document, by its terms, precludes the plaintiff from maintaining a suit on his claims. See, e.g., Reighard v. Limbach Co., Inc., 158 F. Supp. 2d 730, 733 n. 8 (E.D.Va.2001) (collecting cases indicating that an employee can waive existing claims under ERISA); E.E.O.C. v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 299-300, 122 S. Ct. 754, 151 L. Ed. 2d 755 (2002) (indicating that an employee can waive his ability to bring suit on an ADA claim in court); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(f) (providing that an individual can waive rights or claims under the ADEA). The 2008 Document provides, in pertinent part:\\nMr. Davis ... hereby releases Atlantic Dominion, its subsidiaries and any affiliated or related companies, and their officers, stockholders, directors, employees, and agents ... of and from all manner of action and actions, cause and causes of action, suits, ... covenants, contracts, agreements, promises, damages, claims and demands of every kind or character whatsoever, whether presently known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, under state or federal laws, which Mr. Davis now has against Atlantic Dominion, its subsidiaries and any affiliated or related companies, their officers, stockholders, directors, employees, and\/or agents.... Specifically included in this release are any claims, in connection with the past employment relationship between the parties, including, but not limited to, claims for deferred compensation due, or to become due pursuant to *692 alleged breach of any previously executed contract, wrongful discharge, ... the Age Discrimination in Employment Act..., and\/or any other federal or state law relating in any way to employment rights.\\n\\n2008 Document \u00b6 7 (emphasis added).[17] The plaintiff does not dispute that the 2008 Document, by its terms, precludes him from maintaining a suit on all of his claims. Rather, he contends that the 2008 Document should not be enforced because the defendants, \"fraudulently induced Plaintiff into signing the 2008 Document and release,\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 4, ECF No. 52; see also Am. Compl. \u00b6 29. The plaintiff also suggests that his \"mental illnesses ... diminished his ability to significantly understand the effect of executing the 2008 Document.\" See, e.g. Am. Compl. \u00b6 23.\\n\\nA. ERISA and ADA Claims\\nThe court first addresses whether the 2008 Document should be enforced as regards the plaintiffs ERISA and ADA claims. Waiver of ADEA claims is governed by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (\"OWBPA\"), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(f), but there is no federal statute governing waiver of ERISA and ADA claims. In the absence of a controlling statute, federal courts generally enforce releases of federally protected rights in the employment context if the release was knowing and voluntary. See, e.g., Kendall v. City of Chesapeake, Va., 174 F.3d 437, 441 n. 2 (4th Cir.1999); see also Shirey ex rel. Kyger v. City of Alexandria School Bd., 229 F.3d 1143, 2000 WL 1198054 (4th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (unpublished table decision). However, there is no \"generally-applicable body of federal common law principles ... for determining whether releases of particular federal rights secured by specific provisions of federal law can be enforced,\" Kendall, 174 F.3d at 441 n. 1, and \"courts can resolve interstitial questions of federal law ... by adopting existing state law.\" Id. Accordingly, the court evaluates the plaintiffs proffered bases for setting aside his release of any ERISA and ADA claims under ordinary contract principles, and thus turns to Virginia law for guidance. See id.; see also Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 986 F.2d 580, 587 (1st Cir.1993); Leavitt v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 921 F.2d 160, 162 (8th Cir.1990) (\"To determine whether a release [of ERISA claims] is knowing and voluntary, we apply general principles of contract construction.\").\\nThe plaintiff claims that the 2008 Document should be declared null and void on the ground that Ray and Patrick took calculated actions \"designed to fraudulently obtain a release from Plaintiff.\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 3; see also id. at 4-5, 11-15.[18] He claims fraud by both affirmative misrepresentation of material fact and by concealment of material fact.[19]See id. at 11-15. Specifically, he argues that Ray and Patrick falsely represented \"that if he did not execute the document he would get nothing,\" Am. *693 Compl. \u00b6 25; see also Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 4, and that Old Dominion representatives neither informed him that the 1992 Agreement had a disability provision nor that \"he was eligible to retire and receive the majority of his retirement benefits under\" that provision. Am. Compl. \u00b6 24; see also Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 14. In order to prove actual fraud on account of the defendants\\' purported misrepresentations, the plaintiff must show \"(1) a false representation, (2) of a material fact, (3) made intentionally or knowingly, (4) with intent to mislead, (5) reliance by the party misled, and (6) resulting damage to the party misled.\" W. Capital Partners, LLC v. Allegiance Title &amp; Escrow, Inc., 520 F. Supp. 2d 777, 782 (E.D.Va.2007). Concealment, on the other hand, requires a showing of concealment of a material fact along with an intent to conceal. See Bank of Montreal v. Signet Bank, 193 F.3d 818, 827 (4th Cir.1999) (\"Silence does not constitute concealment in the absence of a duty to disclose.\" (citations omitted)).\\nThe plaintiff alleges that Ray and Patrick represented to him that he would not receive any money if he did not sign the 2008 Document because he was not eligible for any benefits under the 1992 Agreement. See Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 10-15. As discussed below, the plaintiff did not adduce sufficient facts to raise a genuine issue that he was entitled to such benefits at the time he signed the 2008 Document.[20] Accordingly, he fails to raise a genuine issue as to whether any such representation was false. Additionally, the plaintiff fails to adduce enough facts upon which one could reasonably conclude that Ray and\/or Patrick made any such representation with the intent to mislead. The plaintiff tries to obfuscate this deficiency by citing to, and misconstruing, immaterial parts of the record. As to Patrick, the plaintiff simply does not cite any part of the record from which one could reasonably infer the requisite intent. He merely offers that Patrick is in charge of Human Resources at Old Dominion and that Patrick was aware of the plaintiffs health issues and of the disability provision in the 1992 Agreement; he does not highlight any probative statements or documents. To the extent the plaintiff could even prove these innocuous facts at trial, they are insufficient to raise a triable issue regarding intent.\\nBeyond offering that Ray was aware of the plaintiffs health issues and the disability provision, the plaintiff seeks to indirectly prove Ray\\'s intent by impeaching her credibility. He claims that Ray testified that she \"had no part in adding language to a document that advised the Plaintiff that he was giving up all rights to his Deferred Compensation Agreement,\" but, according to Patrick, \"Ray told Patrick `to make sure to let [Plaintiff] know that that\\'s off the table\\', referring to the Deferred Compensation Agreement.\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 7 (quoting Patrick Dep. 42, Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 3, ECF No. 52-3). The document that the plaintiff refers to is a handwritten note memorializing his September 18, 2010, meeting with Patrick. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 7, ECF No. 46-7. Other than a request for a severance package, the note only includes the following language, to which Patrick alone signed his name: \"Jimmy Davis to-day stated to me that he knew the deferred compensation benefits is no longer in effect since he will not be working to age 65 years. He realizes that being released terminated this benefits.\" Id. Contrary to the plaintiffs characterization, this *694 document does not advise him that he was giving up his rights to benefits under the 1992 Agreement. To the extent the document advises him at all, it advises him that because he was fired, the 1992 Agreement, by its terms, is null and void.\\nAlso contrary to the plaintiff\\'s characterization, Ray did not testify that she had no part in adding language to the document. Rather, she testified \"I don\\'t know who asked him to put this paragraph in. He might have been asked by an attorney. I don\\'t know.\" Ray Dep. 141. In sum, the plaintiff seeks to establish that Ray told Patrick to inform the plaintiff that, per the terms of the 1992 Agreement, Old Dominion would not be paying deferred compensation benefits and, nearly two years later and in the course of this litigation, Ray cannot remember telling Patrick to do so. If the court draws an inference from Ray\\'s statements in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the inference is that Ray is not a credible witness. However, this inference is not sufficiently probative of an intent to mislead the plaintiff into believing he was not owed benefits.[21] Even if the inference is sufficient to discredit any explanation Ray provides, Virginia law does not presume an intent to mislead, and, accordingly, the defendants do not bear a burden to disprove intent. Accordingly, since the plaintiff provides no indication that he can meet his burden, he fails to raise a genuine issue as to an element essential to setting aside the 2008 Document on the grounds of affirmative misrepresentation.\\nThe plaintiff claims concealment by alleging that Ray and Patrick concealed the material fact that the 1992 Agreement had a disability provision and that the plaintiff was eligible to retire and receive the majority of his retirement benefits at the time the 2008 Document was executed. See Mem. in Opp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 14 (\"Ray and Patrick were aware of the disability clause and intentionally omitted any mention of it when talking to Plaintiff.\"). The defendants do not dispute that Ray and Patrick did not mention the disability provision. However, the plaintiff does not cite to any statement or document that reveals that Ray and Patrick were themselves aware of the disability provision at the relevant times, such that one could entertain that they could intentionally conceal its existence. See Bank of Montreal, 193 F.3d at 827 (noting that \"concealment requires a showing of intent to conceal a material fact; reckless nondisclosure is not actionable\" (citations omitted)). Nevertheless, there is a genuine issue that Ray, but not Patrick, was aware of the provision, as Ray signed the 1992 Agreement. \"In the absence of fraud, duress, or mutual mistake, a person having the capacity to understand a written document who reads it, or, without reading it or having it read to him, signs it, is bound by his signature.\" Metro Realty of Tidewater, Inc. v. Woolard, 223 Va. 92, 286 S.E.2d 197, 200 (1982) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). However, this principle dooms the plaintiff\\'s concealment claim because he too signed the 1992 Agreement, see 1992 Agreement 9; Davis Dep. 70 (\"I signed it.\"), and he does not even allege fraud, mutual mistake, or duress at the time the 1992 Agreement was executed. He also does not even allege that he lacked the ability to understand a written document at that time. Moreover, *695 the plaintiff admits that he kept a copy of the 1992 Agreement, and that he took the copy from his office after he was fired, but prior to signing the 2008 Document. See Davis Dep. 71-72. Accordingly, the plaintiff fails to raise a genuine issue that the disability provision was a fact that was concealed from him.\\nThe plaintiff also fails to adduce enough facts to establish that Ray and Patrick concealed that he was eligible for benefits under the 1992 Agreement at the time he was fired. At a threshold level, the court reiterates that the plaintiff offers no evidence that Ray and Patrick were aware of the disability provision at the relevant times, such that it is plausible that they could intentionally conceal his eligibility under that provision at the time he was fired. The court reiterates too that there nevertheless is a genuine issue that Ray, but not Patrick, was aware of the provision. However, it is indisputable that, by the term of the 1992 Agreement, the plaintiff was ineligible for benefits once he was terminated \"for any reason other than death, disability, or retirement at age 65.\" 1992 Agreement, Art. III(D). Additionally, the plaintiff offers no evidence that Ray was aware that he was eligible at the time he was fired. He only offers that \"Ray was aware of plaintiffs drug and alcohol problems and the fact that he was seeking treatment for mental issues related to those problems.\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 6. This one fact fails to raise a genuine issue for several independent reasons. First, eligibility must be determined under the terms of the 1992 Agreement, and it is undisputed that a licensed physician selected by Old Dominion never deemed the plaintiff disabled.[22] Accordingly, the plaintiff could not prove that Ray knew that he was eligible.[23] Second, as discussed below, Ray did not have a fiduciary duty to inform the plaintiff that he may be eligible for benefits under the 1992 Agreement.[24] Third, in his Response, the plaintiff lists as a material fact that \"Ray did not believe that Plaintiff was entitled to any benefits under the Deferred Compensation Agreement.\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 7. One could not reasonably infer that Ray intentionally concealed a fact that she did not believe existed.\\nIt is unclear if the plaintiff seeks to have the 2008 Document declared null and void on the alternative ground of incompetence.[25] Even if the plaintiffs diminished capacity allegation amounts to an incompetence claim, though, he fails to present enough facts upon which a trier of fact could reasonably find he was incompetent *696 at the time he signed the 2008 Document. Under Virginia law, a person is presumed to be competent to enter into a contract, and a person seeking to avoid a contract on the grounds of incompetence bears the burden of proving his incompetence by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., Bailey v. Bailey, 54 Va.App. 209, 677 S.E.2d 56, 59 (Va.Ct.App.2009). Accordingly, the plaintiff must show that, at the time he signed the 2008 Document, he had insufficient mental capacity to understand the nature of the transaction and to consent to its terms. Id. The plaintiff does not allege that he lacked the capacity to consent to the 2008 Agreement, but he does aver that he had diminished capacity to significantly understand the effect of executing it.\\nEven if such a fact could prove incompetence, the plaintiff has no admissible evidence to establish it. See Toll Bros., Inc. v. Dryvit Sys., Inc., 432 F.3d 564, 568 (4th Cir.2005) (\"Summary judgment is warranted when the admissible evidence forecasted by the parties demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The plaintiffs diminished capacity claim depends entirely on the expert testimony of Dr. Charles Parker; the plaintiff offers no other evidence to establish it. See Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 8-9, 16, 18. However, this evidence is inadmissible at trial because the court granted the defendants\\' motion in limine to preclude Dr. Parker from testifying in regard to the plaintiffs capacity to understand the significance of signing the 2008 Document. Order, ECF No. 66. Because the plaintiff offers no evidence to rebut the presumption of competence, he necessarily fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding his competence to sign the 2008 Document. See Bailey, 677 S.E.2d at 59-60 (\"A party with sufficient mental capacity cannot disaffirm the agreement no matter how `ill-reasoned or ill-advised\\' it might be\" (quoting Drewry v. Drewry, 8 Va.App. 460, 383 S.E.2d 12, 16 (Va.Ct.App.1989))).\\n\\nB. ADEA Claim\\nHaving found that the 2008 Document precludes the plaintiff from bringing his ERISA and ADA claims, the court turns to the enforceability of the 2008 Document as regards waiver of any ADEA claims. Waiver of ADEA claims is governed by the OWBPA. See Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc., 522 U.S. 422, 427, 118 S. Ct. 838, 139 L. Ed. 2d 849 (1998) (holding that a \"release can have no effect on [an] ADEA claim unless it complies with the OWBPA\"). Like ERISA and ADA waivers, a waiver of ADEA claims must be knowing and voluntary. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(f)(1). The OWBPA provides baseline requirements that a waiver must satisfy in order to be considered knowing and voluntary:\\n(A) the waiver is part of an agreement between the individual and the employer that is written in a manner calculated to be understood by such individual, or by the average individual eligible to participate;\\n(B) the waiver specifically refers to rights or claims arising under this chapter;\\n(C) the individual does not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed;\\n(D) the individual waives rights or claims only in exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to which the individual is already entitled;\\n(E) the individual is advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement;\\n\\n*697 (F)(i) the individual is given a period of at least 21 days within which to consider the agreement; ...\\n(G) the agreement provides that for a period of at least 7 days following the execution of such agreement, the individual may revoke the agreement, and the agreement shall not become effective or enforceable until the revocation period has expired;....\\nId.\\nThere is no dispute that the 2008 Document complies with subparagraphs (B), (C), (E) and (G), and the court finds that it complies in those respects. The 2008 Document specifically references the ADEA, as required by subparagraph (B). 2008 Document \u00b6 7. The plaintiff only waived claims that he \"now has against Atlantic Dominion,\" as required by subparagraph (C). Id. In compliance with subparagraph (E), the plaintiff \"represent[ed] and warrant[ed]\" that he was advised in writing of his right to consult an attorney before signing.[26]Id. \u00b6 13; see also Metro Realty of Tidewater, 286 S.E.2d at 200. Finally, the 2008 Document provides that \"Mr. Davis shall have seven (7) days after the execution of this Agreement within which to revoke his signature and consent to this Agreement,\" as required by subparagraph (G). Id. \u00b6 14; see also Davis Dep. 83.\\nThe plaintiff claims there is a genuine issue of material fact that he \"was never afforded the 21 days to review the 2008 Document as evidenced by the waiver that defendants had him sign.\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 8. Whether the plaintiff was given twenty-one days is a material fact, but the plaintiff fails to prove there is a genuine issue because the only evidence he cites proves that Old Dominion complied with the OWBPA. Under the OWBPA, the operative consideration is whether the plaintiff was given twenty-one days to consider the agreement, not whether he actually availed himself of that opportunity. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(f)(1)(F)(i). The waiver the plaintiff refers to is, in reality, a certification, and it provides, \"By my signature below, I certify that I was given 21 days to consider the release of any claim under the [ADEA] and that I have chosen to execute this Agreement prior to the expiration of this period.\"[27] 2008 Document 5 (emphasis added). This does not settle the issue, though, because the plaintiff also asserts that \"the evidence shows that Ray and Patrick exerted their influence over Plaintiff to get him to waive the twenty-one (21) days and sign the document immediately.\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 14-15. If the plaintiff could prove that Ray and Patrick fraudulently induced him into forgoing the opportunity to exercise his statutory right, he might survive summary judgment. Cf. Neely v. Good Samaritan Hosp., 345 Fed.Appx. 39, 44 (6th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (finding that a release of ADEA claims must not only include language giving the employee the requisite statutory right, but the employee \"must also be given the opportunity to exercise that right\"). However, he does not direct the court to any supportive evidence. In the absence of any support in the record, he cannot survive summary judgment. The record only supports the conclusion that the plaintiff properly exercised his right to review the 2008 Document for twenty-one days by \"chos[ing] to execute this Agreement prior to the expiration of this period.\" 2008 Document 5.\\n*698 The plaintiff does not specifically dispute that the 2008 Document complies with subparagraphs (A) and (D). In regards to subparagraph (A), there is no dispute that the 2008 Document is an agreement between the plaintiff and Old Dominion. The plaintiff contends that he did not understand the full significance of signing the 2008 Document, but he bases this allegation on diminished capacity, not any defect in the manner in which it was written. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(f)(1)(A). Moreover, to the extent a diminished capacity is probative of whether subparagraph (A) is met, the court already noted that the plaintiff presents no admissible evidence to establish that fact.[28] In the absence of any evidence that the 2008 Document was written in a manner not calculated to be understood by the plaintiff \"or by the average individual eligible to participate,\" id., there is no genuine issue that the 2008 Document complies with subparagraph (A).\\nIn regards to subparagraph (D), there is no dispute that the plaintiff received $72,000 for executing the 2008 Document. See, e.g., 2008 Document \u00b6 2. In the ADEA\/ADA Complaint, the plaintiff states that he \"signed the 2008 Document for inadequate consideration.\" ADEA\/ADA Complaint \u00b6 25. However, he never supports, let alone renews, this allegation in his Response. Accordingly, there is no genuine issue that the plaintiff waived his ADEA claims in exchange for consideration. It is also undisputed that the $72,000 did not constitute anything of value to which the plaintiff was already entitled at the time he signed the 2008 Document. The plaintiff contends that he was entitled to benefits under the 1992 Agreement at the time he signed the 2008 Document, but he does not offer any evidence, let alone contend, that the $72,000 represented a portion of those benefits; the $72,000 consideration was indisputably \"in addition\" to any benefits. Furthermore, as discussed below, the plaintiff fails to raise a genuine issue that he was entitled to benefits under the 1992 Agreement at the relevant times.[29] Accordingly, there is no genuine issue that the 2008 Document constitutes a valid waiver of any ADEA claim the plaintiff had at the time he was fired.\\nThe plaintiff cannot prove that his waiver of any rights or claims under the ADEA, ADA and ERISA was anything but knowing and voluntary, and, therefore, valid. Accordingly, he is precluded from maintaining suit on his claims, and the court FINDS that the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In consideration of the interplay between the above analysis and the substantive merit of the plaintiffs claims, the court will go forward and address whether \"specific, material facts exist that give rise to a genuine triable issue\" on his claims. In re McNallen, 62 F.3d at 623-24.\\n\\nII. Amended Complaint\\n\\nA. Recovery of Benefits Under the 1992 Agreement\\nCount I of the Amended Complaint is predicated on the allegation that the plaintiff is owed benefits by the terms of the 1992 Agreement. In order to prove entitlement to those benefits, the plaintiff must show that he is a participant or beneficiary of an ERISA plan, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), and that he has met the definition of \"disability\" under the terms of the 1992 Agreement.[30]See e.g., Gallagher *699 v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 305 F.3d 264, 270 (4th Cir.2002). When the court denied the defendants\\' Motion to Dismiss Count I of the Amended Complaint, it reaffirmed that the essence of the plaintiffs claim was not that he was directly denied benefits, but that he was \"prevented... from meeting the procedural conditions necessary to obtain benefits under the ERISA plan ...\" and those benefits \"would have been due under the 1992 Agreement had he not been terminated prior to seeking those benefits.\" Mem. Op. and Order at 4-6, ECF No. 32 (emphasis in original) (quoting Mem. Op. and Order at 11, 13, ECF No. 13).[31] Although \"it would be anomalous to dismiss the first Count ... despite plaintiffs claim that he can prove his entitlement to benefits under the terms of the plan,\" id. at 6, at the summary judgment phase, claims alone no longer suffice. See In re McNallen, 62 F.3d at 623-24. The plaintiff satisfied his pleading burden under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) on the earlier motion to dismiss, but he does not meet his burden to show a genuine issue for trial under Rule 56.\\nIn order to survive summary judgment, the plaintiff must demonstrate that a trier of fact could reasonably find that he was entitled to disability benefits under the 1992 Agreement at the time he was fired. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505. As such, he must point to sufficient evidence in the record that shows but for being fired, he would have been deemed \"disabled\" by a licensed physician selected by Old Dominion;[32] he cannot survive summary judgment by merely showing that but for being fired, he might have received benefits.[33] Accordingly, since the plaintiff only seeks to prove a genuine issue as to whether he had a mental condition or impairment, he did not go far enough to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to Count I.\\nThe plaintiff does not cite to any part of the record that supports a finding that if procedures were initiated to determine his eligibility under the 1992 Agreement, then a licensed physician selected by Old Dominion would have found him disabled. Rather, he points to material that he claims shows Dr. Parker, Ray, and Patrick believed that the plaintiff had health issues. See, e.g., Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for *700 Summ. J. 19-20.[34] Such evidence is consistent with an inference that others might formulate the same opinion. However, this material is merely colorable and, therefore, insufficient for two reasons. First, the inference it creates does not prove the essential element of the claim because it is not enough that a licensed physician selected by Old Dominion might diagnose the plaintiff with the purported health issues. By the terms of the 1992 Agreement, entitlement for benefits only vests if a licensed physician selected by Old Dominion held the opinion that those health issues rendered the plaintiff \"incapable of performing the duties of his position and [those issues are] likely to be of permanent or indefinite duration.\" 1992 Agreement, Art. I(A); cf. Sylvia Dev. Corp. v. Calvert County, Md., 48 F.3d 810, 821-22 (4th Cir.1995) (\"While the summary judgment standard requires us to resolve conflicting inferences from circumstantial evidence in favor of the non-moving party, it does not allow us to ignore or distort the plain meaning of words or conveniently to read them out of context.\" (citations omitted)).\\nSecond, even assuming the inference, in isolation, suggests that a licensed physician selected by Old Dominion would have found that the plaintiff was disabled in September 2008, \"respondents must show that the inferences they suggest are `reasonable in light of the competing inferences.\\'\" M &amp; M Med. Supplies, 981 F.2d at 163 (quoting Matsushita Elec., 475 U.S. at 588, 106 S. Ct. 1348). The competing inference is that a physician selected by Old Dominion might find the plaintiff was not disabled. Unlike the plaintiff\\'s inference, this inference is directly supported by undisputed facts in the record. See Sylvia Dev. Corp., 48 F.3d at 810 (\"Whether an inference is reasonable cannot be decided in a vacuum[.]\" (citations omitted)). Pursuant to this court\\'s August 6, 2010 Order, the plaintiff underwent a mental examination with Dr. Jerome Blackman, a physician the plaintiff admits was selected by Old Dominion. Dr. Blackman was of the opinion that the plaintiff did not have a disability, by any definition, in September 2008.[35] The plaintiff has to show that he is entitled to the inference that another physician selected by Old Dominion would have nonetheless deemed him *701 disabled. He makes no such showing.[36] The Response fails to identify evidence in the record that supports the essential element of his claim. He adduces no evidence that would allow a trier of fact to find that a physician selected by Old Dominion would have deemed him disabled under the terms of the 1992 Agreement. Accordingly, the plaintiff fails to show that there is a genuine issue suitable for trial.\\n\\nB. Interference with ERISA-Protected Rights\\nCount II of the Amended Complaint is predicated on the allegation that the defendants fired the plaintiff and procured the 2008 Document for the purpose of avoiding paying the plaintiff benefits under both the disability benefits and normal retirement benefits provisions of the 1992 Agreement, in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140. In order to prove that the defendants interfered with protected rights by firing him, the plaintiff must show: (1) he was fired; (2) Old Dominion fired him for the purpose of interfering with his benefits under the 1992 Agreement; and (3) he had a vested right to benefits under the 1992 Agreement or that he may have become so entitled but for the firing. See, e.g., Conkwright v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 933 F.2d 231, 236-39 (4th Cir.1991). It is undisputed that the plaintiff was fired and that but for the firing, upon reaching sixtyfive years of age he would have been entitled to retire with benefits. The court need not determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he might have become entitled to disability benefits, because it is clear that he fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of the second element.[37]\\nAs the Fourth Circuit first pronounced in Conkwright, \"to take advantage of [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140], one must prove a specific intent of the employer to interfere with an employee\\'s pension rights.\" Id. at 239. Of course, a plaintiff can meet his burden either through direct or indirect proof. Additionally, due to proof problems similar to Title VII cases, the Fourth Circuit in Conkwright adopted the McDonnell Douglas scheme of presumptions and shifting burdens of production in interference cases predicated on an alleged discriminatory firing. See 933 F.2d at 239; see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Under that scheme, the plaintiff must make a prima facie case of discrimination, then the burden shifts to the defendants to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for firing the plaintiff. See, e.g., Hawkins v. PepsiCo, Inc., 203 F.3d 274, 278 (4th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). If the defendants meet their burden, then the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden to prove that the defendants\\' stated reason is pretext. Id.\\nThe court can assume, without deciding, that the plaintiff established a triable issue regarding his prima facie case because it is clear that he did not present evidence upon which a trier of fact could reasonably find that the defendants\\' stated *702 reason of poor job performance and excessive unaccounted absent days is mere pretext. The plaintiff claims that \"Ray did not want Plaintiff to qualify for his Deferred Compensation for the simple reason that she would personally benefit.\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 4. The gravamen of this allegations is that, as the owner of Old Dominion stock, \"for every one dollar ($1.00) [Old Dominion] saved, [Ray] benefits personally.\" Id. The plaintiff cannot defeat a motion for summary judgment with this allegation. He does not cite any evidence indicating that Ray was seeking to benefit personally from the firing, and the mere fact that Old Dominion saved money by firing the plaintiff is insufficient to demonstrate that the defendants\\' stated reason is pretext. See Conkwright, 933 F.2d at 239; see also Wright v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 81 Fed.Appx. 37, 45 (6th Cir.2003) (\"Proximity to vesting and a showing of cost savings is not sufficient, standing alone, to entitle plaintiff to a trial.\").\\nThe plaintiffs other proffers also fail to rebut the defendants\\' stated legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for firing him. He cites his own testimony that \"he was often out of the office on calls or on the street meeting with customers or potential customers,\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. at 9 (citing Davis Dep. 45), but he never disputes that he missed fifty-two days of work in 2008 before September 16, 2008, that Ray believed he missed that many days at the time she fired him, and that those absences were not excused.[38] This testimony does not provide a basis for a trier of fact to reasonably infer that Ray harbored the specific intent to interfere with the plaintiffs ERISA-protected rights. The plaintiff also cites to Ray\\'s testimony that the plaintiff is not entitled to any benefits because he was fired prior to reaching the age of sixty-five, and to her testimony that suggests she was aware of the plaintiffs health issues. However, these facts are too innocuous to reasonably infer the requisite intent by the path of pretext. See Conkwright, 933 F.2d at 239; see also Wright, 81 Fed.Appx. at 45. Under such reasoning, anytime an employer fires an employee prior to the age of retirement, or anytime an employer fires an employee with a known health issue, for excessive unexcused absences, the employer\\'s action would be suspect. A trier of fact could not reasonably infer that the defendants\\' stated reason is pretext based simply on the fact that the defendants knew the plaintiff had health issues and that the plaintiff would be eligible to retire with benefits under the 1992 Agreement at age sixty-five. See M &amp; M Med. Supplies, 981 F.2d at 163.\\nInstead of pointing the court to material facts that demonstrate the defendants\\' stated reason is mere pretext, the plaintiff sets forth an incongruous argument that the court should apply a modified abuse of discretion standard of review as set out in Doe v. Group Hospitalization &amp; Medical Serv., 3 F.3d 80 (4th Cir.1993), and \"scrutinize[ ] to a higher degree\" Ray\\'s decision to fire the plaintiff. Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 22. Doe is not pertinent to an ERISA interference claim. The Doe plaintiff was challenging a plan administrator\\'s decision to deny him coverage, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132; there was no interference claim, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140. The plaintiff fails to even address the McDonnell Douglas scheme. He misapprehends the defendants\\' burden, and incorrectly claims that the \"defendants must have more substantial evidence to support [its firing] decision\" than \"handwritten notes that allegedly documented *703 Plaintiff\\'s numerous absences from work.\" Id. at 22-23. Under the McDonnell Douglas scheme, it is the plaintiff who must make a evidentiary showing that casts doubt on the defendants\\' stated legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for firing the plaintiff, and as stated, the plaintiff fails to make any such showing. Accordingly, he has not met his burden to show that there is a genuine issue suitable for trial.\\nThe plaintiff also claims that the defendants interfered with his rights under ERISA when he and Old Dominion executed the 2008 Document. As a threshold matter, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140 does not proscribe release agreements, no matter the employer\\'s specific intent. That Code provision states that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant\" for the purpose of interfering with ERISA-protected rights. The plaintiff does not offer any basis to construe those six actions as embracing the execution of a release agreement. Nonetheless, even if that provision implicates the 2008 Document, the plaintiff\\'s claim fails as a matter of law.\\nIn order to prove that the defendants interfered with protected rights by executing the 2008 Document, the plaintiff must show: (1) Old Dominion executed the 2008 Document with him; (2) Old Dominion did so for the purpose of interfering with his benefits under the 1992 Agreement; and (3) he had a vested right to benefits under the 1992 Agreement or he may have become so entitled but for signing the 2008 Document. See, e.g., Conkwright, 933 F.2d at 236-39. Having already found that the plaintiff fails to show that there is a genuine issue that he was fired in order to interfere with ERISA-protected rights and that he would have received benefits under the 1992 Agreement but for his firing,[39] the court need not dwell long on this claim. By the terms of the 1992 Agreement, \"[s]hould the [plaintiff\\'s] services for [Old Dominion] be terminated for any reason other than death, disability or retirement at age 65, all of the [plaintiff\\'s] benefits under this Agreement shall be forfeited and this Agreement shall become null and void.\" 1992 Agreement, Art. III(D) (emphasis added). In other words, the plaintiff was unequivocally foreclosed from collecting benefits under the 1992 Agreement in the event he was fired from his job. It is undisputed that he was fired from his job, thus, at the time he signed the 2008 Document, he had neither a vested right to benefits under the 1992 Agreement nor might he have become so entitled but for signing the 2008 Document. Accordingly, the plaintiff cannot raise a triable issue on the third element of the interference proof, and his claim fails as a matter of law.\\n\\nC. Breach of Fiduciary Duty\\nThe third count of the Amended Complaint is predicated on the allegation that Ray and the Old Dominion Board of Directors are fiduciaries under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A), and they breached their fiduciary duty, in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104 and 1109, thereby authorizing the plaintiff to bring a claim pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2). In order to survive summary judgment, the plaintiff must make the threshold showing that there is a genuine issue that the 1992 Agreement is subject to ERISA\\'s fiduciary requirements. The defendants contend that there is no genuine issue that the 1992 Agreement is exempt from ERISA\\'s fiduciary requirements because the undisputed facts show it is a \"top-hat\" plan. A top-hat plan refers to \"a plan which is unfunded *704 and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(1). Top-hat plans are exempt from the substantive requirements of ERISA, including fiduciary requirements,[40]id., \"because `Congress recognized that certain individuals, by virtue of their position or compensation level, have the ability to affect or substantially influence, through negotiation or otherwise, the design and operation of their deferred compensation plan ... and, therefore, [do] not need the substantive rights and protections of Title I.\\'\" Carr v. First Nationwide Bank, 816 F. Supp. 1476, 1491 (N.D.Ca.1993) (quoting U.S. Dep\\'t of Labor ERISA Op. 90-14A). Accordingly, in addition to the two explicit statutory requirements, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(1), several courts recognize a third requirement: that employees participating in the alleged top hat plan have sufficient influence within the company to negotiate compensation agreements that will protect their interests where ERISA provisions do not apply. See Guiragoss v. Khoury, 444 F. Supp. 2d 649, 658-59 (E.D.Va.2006) (citations omitted); but see Alexander v. Brigham and Women\\'s Physicians Org., Inc., 513 F.3d 37, 46-47 (1st Cir.2008) (declining to follow those courts that recognize a bargaining power requirement).\\nThere is no genuine issue that the plan is unfunded.[41] In determining whether a plan is unfunded, a court asks whether \"the beneficiary [can] establish, through the plan documents, a legal right any greater than that of an unsecured creditor to a specific set of funds from which the employer is, under the terms of the plan, obligated to pay the deferred compensation.\" Guiragoss, 444 F.Supp.2d at 659-60 (quoting Demery v. Extebank Deferred Compensation Plan (B), 216 F.3d 283, 287 (2d Cir.2000)). The plaintiff cannot do so. Without citing to plan documents or any support in the record, he merely claims that Old Dominion intended to fund the 1992 Agreement with a life insurance policy on his life.[42] Unsupported allegations cannot defeat a summary judgment motion, and the plain language of the 1992 Agreement shows that the plaintiff \"remain[s] simply a general creditor of the Company in the same manner as any other creditor having a general claim for matured and unpaid compensation.\" 1992 Agreement, Art. IV.\\nThe plaintiff does not dispute that the 1992 Agreement meets the second requirement, and the undisputed facts support a finding that it does. The 1992 Agreement was negotiated in an effort to retain a select group composed of management and highly compensated employees\\x97the plaintiff and Patrick.[43] There is no genuine issue that the plaintiff, a Vice-President, and Patrick, a Secretary\/Treasurer, were high-level employees nor that they were the second and third highest paid employees at Old Dominion, respectively. Accordingly, the second requirement is satisfied.\\nAlthough the plaintiff argues the third requirement is not met, his argument is misguided, and he does not cite to any evidence that demonstrates a genuine issue of material fact. Citing to his own *705 testimony, he argues that the 1992 Agreement was drafted by the defendants and given to him with no opportunity to negotiate changes. Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 25 (citing Davis Dep. 71). He avers that because he took no part in negotiating the 1992 Agreement, he \"had no opportunity to negotiate the Agreement to protect his own interests.\" Id. However, this line of reasoning is off the mark because the material fact is overall ability, not the presentation of an opportunity. Restated, the issue is whether the plaintiff had sufficient influence within the company to negotiate an agreement that would protect his interests where ERISA provisions do not apply; it is immaterial that he did not, in fact, negotiate the 1992 Agreement.[44]See Demery, 216 F.3d at 289. The plaintiff was a Vice-President, a high level executive assumed to possess a favorable bargaining position to negotiate the terms of a deferred compensation agreement. He does not offer any evidence that suggests insufficient bargaining power. See id. at 290.\\nThe plaintiff fails to make the threshold showing that there is a genuine issue that the 1992 Agreement is subject to ERISA\\'s fiduciary requirements. Accordingly, since he cannot show that Ray and the Old Dominion Board of Directors were subject to any fiduciary duty under ERISA, his claim fails as a matter of law.\\n\\nIII. ADEA\/ADA Complaint\\n\\nA. ADEA Claim\\nCount I of the ADEA\/ADA Complaint is predicated on the allegation that Old Dominion violated the ADEA by firing the plaintiff on the basis of his age and health three years before retirement and while he was disabled. The plaintiff also claims that Old Dominion violated the ADEA by treating him differently than other similarly situated younger employees and replacing him with a younger, less qualified employee. ADEA\/ADA Complaint \u00b6 35. The plaintiff can prove his entitlement to relief in two ways. The ordinary standard of proof requires that he show: (1) he was an employee covered by the ADEA; (2) he suffered an unfavorable action by an employer covered by the ADEA; and (3) age was a determining factor, meaning that but for the employer\\'s motive to discriminate against him on the basis of age, he would not have been subject to that unfavorable action. See E.E.O.C. v. Clay Printing Co., 955 F.2d 936, 940-41 (4th Cir.1992).\\nIt is undisputed that the plaintiff was an employee covered by the ADEA, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 631(a), and that Old Dominion, an employer covered under the\\n*706 ADEA, see id. \u00a7 630(b), fired him. However, the plaintiff must \"`produce direct evidence of a stated purpose to discriminate [on the basis of age] and\/or circumstantial evidence of a stated purpose to discriminate [on the basis of age] of sufficient probative force to reflect a genuine issue of material fact.\\'\" E.E.O.C., 955 F.2d at 941 (quoting Goldberg v. B. Green &amp; Co., Inc., 836 F.2d 845, 848 (4th Cir. 1988)). As the Fourth Circuit recognized, \"when a plaintiff admits under oath that he or she cannot point to any statement or piece of physical evidence indicative of age discrimination, it undermines the plaintiff\\'s claim.\" Id. In his deposition, the plaintiff admitted that no one at Old Dominion ever made a comment to him about his age, and he stated that his only evidence of age discrimination was that \"I wouldn\\'t get that bonus if I didn\\'t reach 65, and I was getting pretty close to it.\" Davis Dep. 25; see also id. at 26 (indicating that he has no other reason to believe he was subject to age discrimination). Although these admission are not fatal, there is no evidence in the record that Old Dominion had a stated purpose to discriminate against the plaintiff on the basis of his age when it fired him. Similarly, there is no evidence that the plaintiff was even treated differently at work, let alone on account of his age. Indeed, the Response makes no reference to unlawful treatment while the plaintiff was employed by Old Dominion and merely argues that he was fired in violation of the ADEA.\\nSimilar to interference with ERISA rights claims under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140, however, the plaintiff may also resort to the McDonnell Douglas scheme, E.E.O.C., 955 F.2d at 941. Under that scheme, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case, then the burden shifts to Old Dominion to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for taking action against the employee. If Old Dominion meets its burden, then the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden to prove that Old Dominion\\'s stated reason is pretext. E.E.O.C., 955 F.2d at 941. That burden requires the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that Old Dominion\\'s action was based upon age or that its proffered reason is \"`unworthy of credence.\\'\" Id. (quoting Texas Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). Unlike the interference claim under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140, however, the court will not assume that the plaintiff established a triable issue regarding his prima facie case because it is clear that he did not.\\nIn order to establish a prima facie case that age was a determining factor in firing the plaintiff, the plaintiff must show: (1) he was an employee covered by the ADEA; (2) he was fired by an employer covered by the ADEA; (3) at the time he was fired, he was performing at a satisfactory level, meeting his employer\\'s legitimate expectations, and (4) following his firing, he was replaced by a person outside the protected class.[45]Id. The first two elements are met, but the plaintiff offers no evidence to establish that his replacement was outside the protected class.[46]*707 Additionally, he fails to adduce any evidence that he was performing at a satisfactory level, meeting Old Dominion\\'s legitimate expectations in September 2008. The plaintiff does not dispute that he missed fifty-two days of work in 2008.[47] Moreover, he admitted under oath that he thought he was fired because he was not doing his job and that Ray had told him he was missing too many days at work. Davis Dep. 25 and 45. At the summary judgment phase, the court is not weighing the facts to determine the truth, and, therefore, these parts of the record do not mandate summary judgment. However, absent any evidence in the record supporting an inference that the plaintiff was performing his job at a satisfactory level, meeting Old Dominion\\'s legitimate expectations, they certainly underscore that there is no genuine issue that age was a determining factor in firing him.\\nThe plaintiff also fails to show that he can establish a prima facie case that he endured disparate treatment on the basis of his age. In order to establish a prima facie case, the plaintiff must show: (1) he was an employee covered by the ADEA; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse employment action raises a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. See, e.g., Jackson v. Winter, 497 F. Supp. 2d 759, 767 (E.D.Va.2007) (citations omitted). As stated by the Fourth Circuit, \"[a]n adverse employment action is a discriminatory act which `adversely affect[s] the terms, conditions, or benefits of the plaintiff\\'s employment.\\'\" James v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc., 368 F.3d 371, 375 (4th Cir.2004) (quoting Von Gunten v. Maryland, 243 F.3d 858, 865 (4th Cir.2001)). As already noted, the plaintiff offers no evidence that he was treated differently at work, let alone on account of his age, and, moreover, the Response makes no reference to unlawful treatment while he was employed by Old Dominion. See Evans v. Techs. Apps. &amp; Serv. Co., 80 F.3d 954, 960 (4th Cir.1996) (recognizing that \"unsubstantiated allegations and bald assertions\" are insufficient to show discrimination). Accordingly, because the plaintiff fails to show that he can establish a prima facie case, his claim fails as a matter of law.\\n\\nB. ADA Claim\\nCount II of the ADEA\/ADA Complaint is predicated on the allegation that Old Dominion violated the ADA by firing the plaintiff on account of a disability, refusing to make reasonable accommodations for him, and treating him differently than other, non-disabled employees of Old Dominion. In order to prove Old Dominion violated the ADA, the plaintiff must first establish that he is a \"qualified individual with a disability\" under the ADA. See Rohan v. Networks Presentations LLC, 375 F.3d 266, 272 (4th Cir.2004); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112 (2006).[48] A qualified individual with a disability is an individual with a disability \"who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individuals holds or desires.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Accordingly, the plaintiff had to show that there is a genuine *708 issue of material fact that he is both qualified and disabled. Rohan, 375 F.3d at 272. The court need not determine whether the plaintiff offers sufficient evidence that he was disabled, because it is clear that he fails to meet his burden to show that he was qualified at the relevant time.[49]\\nIn order to survive summary judgment, the plaintiff had to show that with or without reasonable accommodations he could perform the essential functions of his position at Old Dominion or a position that he desired. The essential functions of a job are those \"that bear more than a marginal relationship to the job at issue.\" Porter v. U.S. Alumoweld Co., Inc., 125 F.3d 243, 247 n. 3 (4th Cir. 1997). As a threshold matter, the plaintiff never indicates that he desired a position other than the one he occupied at the time he was fired.[50] Accordingly, the court need only determine if he made a sufficient showing in regards to the position he occupied at the time he was fired. The parties do not dispute that the plaintiff was a Vice President of the Beverage, CO2, and Vending Department and that his focus was efforts on development of the drink and snack vending operation at Old Dominion. See Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 4; ADEA\/ADA Compl. \u00b6 10. In his deposition, the plaintiff testified that his duties were to \"[o]versee the operations of the division\" and \"just go get the business.\" Davis Dep. 26. He also testified that he was often out of the office on calls or following leads. See id. 45. The plaintiff does not point to any support in the record, let alone allege, that he could perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodations, at the relevant times.[51] He merely alleges he \"was a qualified employee with a disability.\" Mem. in Opp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 27. This unsupported assertion would not allow a jury to reasonably find that he was qualified.[52] The plaintiff fails to show there is a genuine triable issue that he was a qualified individual under the ADA. Accordingly, his claim fail as a matter of law.\\nBecause the plaintiff fails to make a sufficient showing to establish the existence of elements essential to his case, and on which he bears the burden of proof, with respect to all of his claims under the Amended Complaint and all of his claims under the ADEA\/ADA Complaint, the *709 court FINDS that the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\n\\nConclusion\\nFor the reasons stated above, the court GRANTS the defendants\\' Motion for Summary Judgment. The Clerk shall enter judgment for defendants in both cases, action no. 2:09cv603 and action no. 2:10cv130.\\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  The court will hereafter refer to the Amended Complaint in state court as the \"Complaint.\"\\n[2]  All references hereafter to this filing in federal court will be to the \"Amended Complaint.\"\\n[3]  The facts stated in the Amended Complaint are substantively the same as those in the Complaint, except that the plaintiff has stated additional facts to support and clarify his claim for relief under ERISA.\\n[4]  All references hereafter to this filing in federal court will be to the \"ADEA\/ADA Complaint.\"\\n[5]  In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, \"the Court may assume that facts identified by the moving party in its listing of material facts are admitted, unless such a fact is controverted in the statement of genuine issues filed in opposition to the motion.\" E.D. Va. Loc. Civ. R. 56(B); see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). The defendants contend that the court should ignore the Response, and only consider their statement of undisputed facts, because the Response was filed \"out of time.\" See Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J 1 n. 1, ECF No. 59 [hereinafter \"Reply\"]. The court disagrees and directs the defendants to the court\\'s October 13, 2010 Order granting the plaintiff\\'s Motion for Leave to File his Response After the Expiration of the Specified Time. ECF No. 58. For that reason, citation to Fuqua v. Tarmac of America, Inc., 228 F. Supp. 2d 755 (E.D.Va. 2002) is unavailing. In that case, as here, the plaintiff filed beyond the deadline. However, Fuqua never moved for an extension, and, accordingly, one was never entered. The defendants also point to Fuqua in support of their contention that the court should only consider the defendants\\' statement of undisputed facts because the Response \"did not specifically oppose any of the [defendants\\'] Undisputed Facts.\" Reply 1 n. 1. Again, citation to Fuqua is unavailing. Although the court noted that Fuqua did \"not attempt to answer or dispute the defendants\\' facts directly,\" Fuqua, 228 F.Supp.2d at 756 n. 2 (emphasis added), the court did not propound a stringent standard for crafting an opposition brief. Here, the Response included a captioned section listing all material facts that the plaintiff claims demonstrate the inappropriateness of summary judgment. It is true that a party opposing summary judgment must show that a purportedly undisputed fact is controverted. Nonetheless, the court will not ignore the Response based on stylistic formalities when the plaintiff otherwise complied with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Local Civil Rules.\\n[6]  Allen Patrick (\"Patrick\"), Old Dominion\\'s Secretary\/Treasurer, was the only other employee to enter into a 1992 Agreement. At that time, the plaintiff and Patrick were the second and third highest paid employees at Old Dominion, respectively. Since the 1980s, only three other management-level employees at Old Dominion entered into similar agreements.\\n[7]  The 1992 Agreement defines \"Disability\" as \"[a] physical or mental injury, condition or impairment which, in the opinion of a licensed physician selected by the Company, renders the Executive incapable of performing the duties of his position and is likely to be of permanent or indefinite duration.\" 1992 Agreement, Art. 1(A).\\n[8]  This court previously recognized that Old Dominion\\'s general assets are the source of financing the plan. Davis v. Old Dominion Tobacco Co. Inc., 688 F. Supp. 2d 466, 470 (E.D.Va.2010). The plaintiff does not dispute that the plan does not designate a specific set of funds from which Old Dominion would be obligated to pay any benefits due. Rather, he highlights the undisputed fact that Old Dominion took out a life insurance policy on him at the time of execution of the 1992 Agreement, and, without citing any material in the record, \"contends that the policy was intended to fund the [1992 Agreement].\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 24, ECF No. 52.\\n[9]  On January 10, 2007, the plaintiff met with Dr. Charles Parker, his treating psychiatrist. Dr. Parker and his staff noted that the plaintiff suffered from mental health problems, such as Major Depressive Affective Disorder, a recurrent problem, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.\\n[10]  The record is silent as to whether the plaintiff continued to work for the entire time he received treatment, though the plaintiff does claim that he was still a valuable employee while in treatment. He also claims that Ray told him, with regard to his health problems, \"that it was okay, not to worry about it, and to take as much time as he needed to recover and complete medical treatment.\" See Am. Compl. \u00b6 19, ECF. No. 14. Ray claims that she meant the plaintiff could take time \"to see whatever doctors or whoever was going to treat him,\" and \"[h]e did not bring us any information on treatment, nor expected time frame.\" Ray Dep. 75, Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 1, ECF No. 52-1 [hereinafter \"Ray Dep.\"].\\n[11]  The plaintiff does not dispute that he never requested to be examined by a licensed physician selected by Old Dominion prior to termination of his employment nor that such an examination never took place. He also does not dispute that Dr. Parker never was asked to prepare any documentation regarding a disability and\/or need for accommodations. Dr. Parker indicates that patients request such notes \"all the time,\" and he would have been willing to provide the plaintiff with such documentation upon request. See Parker Dep. 110, Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 4, ECF No. 46-4 [hereinafter \"Parker Dep.\"].\\n[12]  Ray stated that the plaintiff \"has not been replaced.\" Ray Dep. 154.\\n[13]  On two occasions in the year leading up to the firing, Ray told the plaintiff that he was not attending work regularly. At the time of the firing, Ray told the plaintiff that he had already missed fifty-two days of work in 2008 alone. The plaintiff does not dispute that statistic, and even stated that he thought Ray believed it to be true. See Davis Dep. 87, Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 1, ECF No. 46-1 [hereinafter \"Davis Dep.\"]. In muted disagreement, he highlights his own testimony that he was often out of the office on business matters. Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 9, ECF No. 52 (citing Davis Dep. 45). However, the plaintiff does not dispute that he was inexcusably absent and he does not even allege that the defendants mistakenly believed him absent when he was instead out of the office on business matters. The plaintiff also points to material that suggests Ray told him to take as much time as he needed to recover. See supra note 10. However, he does not point to any evidence, let alone contend, that any of his fifty-two absences from work were attributable to doctor\\'s visits or any other circumstance related to recovery. Moreover, he does not point to any evidence, let alone contend, that he provided Ray or anyone at Old Dominion with information suggesting that any of his absences were attributable to such a circumstance. Without such a showing, Ray\\'s statement cannot reasonably be inferred to excuse fifty-two unexplained absences. In sum, the plaintiff does not present any evidence to support a genuine issue of fact regarding his absenteeism.\\n[14]  The plaintiff confirmed these bases by written acknowledgment. Acknowledgment of Termination, Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 6, ECF No. 46-6. The Acknowledgment further provided that Ray would \"consider a moderate separation package,\" and \"if [one] is negotiated [the plaintiff] will be willing to sign a release.\" Id.\\n[15]  There is no dispute that this meeting took place. The plaintiff stated, \"I wanted to make sure I should sign it or whatever, one of those agreements.\" Davis Dep. 74. However, he contends that his wife\\'s brother did not provide any legal advice, and notes that his wife\\'s brother practices in a different area of the law. See Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 7-8.\\n[16]  See infra note 17 and accompanying text. Additionally, the 2008 Document advised the plaintiff to seek counsel, gave him twenty-one (21) days to review the Document before signing it, and gave him seven (7) days to revoke his signature and consent after signing it. The plaintiff never revoked his signature, and on the same day he signed the 2008 Document, he signed a written certification that we was given 21 days \"to consider the release of any claim under the [ADEA]\" and chose \"to execute the [2008 Document] prior to the expiration of this period.\" 2008 Document, Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 2, ECF No. 52-2.\\n[17]  The 2008 Document recites that Old Dominion \"found it necessary to sever the employment relationship ... due to work performance and absenteeism.\" 2008 Document \u00b6 B. The 2008 Document also provides that it does not constitute an admission or statement or wrongdoing or breach of contract, and that the plaintiff carefully reviewed its terms and executed it \"of his own volition\". 2008 Document \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; see also supra note 16.\\n[18]  The court evaluates a claim to set aside a contract due to misrepresentations and\/or concealment of material fact under Virginia\\'s law of fraud. See, e.g., W. Capital Partners, LLC v. Allegiance Title &amp; Escrow, Inc., 520 F. Supp. 2d 777, 781-82 (E.D.Va.2007).\\n[19]  Plaintiff does not claim constructive fraud.\\n[20]  See infra Part II.A.\\n[21]  Moreover, the plaintiff cites Ray\\'s testimony in support of the proposition that \"Ray did not believe that Plaintiff was entitled to any benefits under the Deferred Compensation Agreement.\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. For Summ. J. 7. It is difficult to envision how the plaintiff might prove an intent to mislead when he concedes that the alleged misleading party believed her statement was factually accurate.\\n[22]  See supra notes 7 and 11 and accompanying text.\\n[23]  See supra note 11 and accompanying text; see also infra Part II.A (finding that plaintiff fails to raise a genuine issue that he would have been deemed eligible but for being fired); Part II.B (finding that plaintiff fails to raise a genuine issue that the defendants possessed the specific intent to fire him in order to interfere with his rights under the 1992 Agreement).\\n[24]  See infra Part II.C (finding that the 1992 Agreement is not subject to ERISA\\'s fiduciary requirements).\\n[25]  The Response presents \"Material Facts Regarding the Fraudulent Procurement of the 2008 Document\" and \"Material Facts in Regarding [sic] the Opinions of Dr. Parker.\" See Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 7-9. However, the plaintiff does not directly address the merits of the defendants\\' argument that he failed to raise a genuine issue of incompetence at the time the 2008 Document was executed. Rather, the plaintiff argues that he \"is not required to prove incompetence in order for the 2008 Document to be set aside. Plaintiff contends the misrepresentation of the defendants fraudulently induced Plaintiff into signing the 2008 Document.\" Id. at 10.\\n[26]  See supra note 15 and accompanying text.\\n[27]  The plaintiff also \"represent[ed] and warrant[ed]... that Atlantic Dominion has given Mr. Davis a period of twenty-one (21) days within which to consider this Agreement.\" 2008 Document \u00b6 13.\\n[28]  See supra at 24-25.\\n[29]  See infra Part II.A.\\n[30]  There is no dispute that the plaintiff is a participant or beneficiary of the 1992 Agreement, and the court has already determined that the 1992 Agreement is an ERISA plan. See Mem. Op. and Order at 6-7, ECF No. 13.\\n[31]  In other words, the plaintiff claims that \"but for the defendants\\' conduct, [he] would have been deemed `disabled,\\' as defined under the 1992 Agreement, and, knowing this, the defendants terminated him before he was able to initiate such procedures.\" Mem. Op. and Order at 6, ECF No. 32.\\n[32]  See supra note 7.\\n[33]  See supra note 31 and accompanying text. Whether the plaintiff might have been entitled to benefits under the 1992 Agreement is a material fact as regards his claim for interference with ERISA-protected rights. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140 (deeming it unlawful to fire a plan participant \"for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled\" (emphasis added)). However, it is immaterial to the plaintiff\\'s claim that but for the defendants\\' actions, he would have received benefits under the terms of the plan itself. The court will not collapse two different provisions of ERISA into one. Congress\\'s decision to provide a separate cause of action in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140 for purposeful interference necessarily precludes one from reading 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132 as providing for the same enforcement mechanism. See U.S. v. Ryan-Webster, 353 F.3d 353, 366 (4th Cir.2003) (discussing an \"interpretive canon\" known as the rule against superfluity, in which courts must avoid any interpretation of statutory provisions and words which render them superfluous); see also Conkwright v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 933 F.2d 231, 237 (4th Cir.1991).\\n[34]  Although the plaintiff\\'s expert, Dr. Parker, can testify to the plaintiff\\'s health issues and the general impact of them, he is specifically precluded from testifying that the plaintiff was disabled and incapable of performing the duties of his position at the time he was fired. See Order, ECF No. 66.\\n[35]  The plaintiff does not dispute Dr. Blackman\\'s diagnosis, but rather argues that \"a Treating Physician should be given greater deference in ERISA conflict of interest cases.\" Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 16. In support of that contention, he points the court to Davidson v. Kemper Nat\\'l Services, Inc., 231 F. Supp. 2d 446 (W.D.Va.2002). However, his argument and Davidson are completely inapposite. Foremost, Dr. Parker will not testify that the plaintiff was disabled at the time he was fired. See Order, ECF No. 66. Additionally, in Davidson, the district court was reviewing a plan administrator\\'s decision to deny benefits under ERISA, whereas here, there is no decision to review. Although this is reason enough to ignore Davidson, the court also notes that the disability clause at issue in Davidson, unlike the clause at issue here, did not link a disability finding to the opinion of a licensed physician selected by the Company. Moreover, the Davidson court specifically noted that the \"the Fourth Circuit has yet to formally decide whether the `Treating Physician\\'s Rule,\\' ... should be used in ERISA cases.\" Davidson, 231 F.Supp.2d at 454. Finally, the Fourth Circuit noted that the Treating Physician\\'s Rule \"only requires an award of benefits based upon a treating doctor\\'s opinion of disability absent persuasive contradictory evidence,\" Elliott v. Sara Lee Corp., 190 F.3d 601, 607 (4th Cir.1999), and here, such persuasive contradictory evidence exists.\\n[36]  The court is not weighing the persuasiveness of Dr. Blackman\\'s opinion against Dr. Parker\\'s opinion and any statements made by Old Dominion employees. The operative consideration at summary judgment is whether the plaintiff has shown that those materials would allow a trier of fact to reasonably infer that a licensed physician selected by Old Dominion would have considered him disabled in September of 2008 in light of the competing inference and the undisputed fact that a licensed physician selected by Old Dominion did not find that he was disabled.\\n[37]  The plaintiff fails to raise a genuine issue that he had a vested right to disability benefits at the time he was fired. See supra Part II.A.\\n[38]  See supra note 13.\\n[39]  See supra Part II.A.\\n[40]  Top-hat plans are not exempt from ERISA\\'s reporting,\\' disclosure, administration and enforcement provisions. See, e.g., Guiragoss v. Khoury, 444 F. Supp. 2d 649, 658 n. 10 (E.D.Va.2006) (citations omitted).\\n[41]  See supra note 8 and accompanying text.\\n[42]  See supra note 8.\\n[43]  See supra note 6; see also 1992 Agreement, Preamble.\\n[44]  It might be material if the plaintiff attempted to negotiate the 1992 Agreement and Old Dominion rebuffed him, but he makes no such allegation and his testimony, the only material he cites in this regard, permits no such inference:\\n\\nQ. Okay. Tell me\\x97did you have any discussion with Robin to negotiate the terms of this agreement, Exhibit 3?\\nA. No.\\nQ. So, this agreement was presented to you and you executed it?\\nA. Yes.\\nQ. Were you given a copy of the agreement?\\nA. Yes.\\nQ. Did you read the agreement before you signed it?\\nA. Not all the way through.\\nQ. Is that your practice to\\x97\\nA. No. I just felt like if Robin was doing something nice, she wouldn\\'t be\\x97I just signed it, very trusting of her.\\nQ. What did you do with the copy of the agreement that you were given?\\nA. I had a file there at the office. I put it there.\\nDavis Dep. 71.\\n[45]  A individual in the protected class is \"at least 40 years of age.\" See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 631(a).\\n[46]  The plaintiff only alleges that he was replaced by a younger employee in violation of the ADEA. ADEA\/ADA Comp. \u00b6 35. Of note, the ADEA\/ADA Complaint alleges that the replacement, the plaintiff\\'s brother Phillip Davis, is fifteen years younger than the plaintiff. Id. \u00b6 15. The plaintiff was sixty-two at the time he was fired. Accordingly, if the replacement is, in fact, fifteen years younger than the plaintiff, then the replacement was within the protected class. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 631(a).\\n[47]  See supra note 13.\\n[48]  Amendments to the ADA took effect on January 1, 2009, after the relevant conduct underlying the plaintiff\\'s ADA claims. As the Fourth Circuit recognized, \"Congress did not express its intent for these changes to apply retroactively,\" thus the court must look to the ADA in its form prior to the amendments. See Shin v. Maryland Med. Sys. Corp., 369 Fed.Appx. 472, 478 n. 14 (4th Cir.2010) (citing Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 270-71, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994) and Olatunji v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 383, 389 (4th Cir.2004)).\\n[49]  Of note, like his ADEA claim, the plaintiff admitted that he could not point to any statement or piece of physical evidence indicative of discrimination in violation of the ADA. See E.E.O.C., 955 F.2d at 941. In response to the question \"How do you think Atlantic Dominion violated the [ADA] with respect to you?\", the plaintiff responded, \"I don\\'t know.\" Davis Dep. 86.\\n[50]  In the ADEA\/ADA Complaint, the plaintiff only claims that \"he can, with reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of the job that he held while in the employ of Old Dominion.\" ADEA\/ADA Complaint \u00b6 39. He does not allege any desired position nor that he could perform his job without reasonable accommodation.\\n[51]  The court again notes that the plaintiff does not raise a dispute that he missed fiftytwo days of work in 2008. See supra note 13. Moreover, plaintiff admitted under oath that he thought he was fired because he was not doing his job and that Ray had told him he was missing too many days at work. Davis Dep. 25 and 45.\\n[52]  The plaintiff actually seeks to establish that he was not qualified. He alleges that his \"condition impaired his ability to perform his duties as Vice President,\" Mem. in Opp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 27, and he highlights Dr. Parker\\'s opinion that \"[p]laintiff was incapable of performing the duties of his position as senior vice-president.\" Id. at 18 (emphasis added). Dr. Parker is precluded from testifying at trial to this opinion, see Order, ECF No. 66, but it is significant that the plaintiff seeks to establish this fact despite pursuing an ADA claim.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 2474924}]"},{"id":2496227,"date_filed":"2005-09-20","judges":"Dominguez","case_name_full":"Manuel SANCHEZ RAMOS, Plaintiff, v.

In sum, Plaintiff is seeking several equitable, compensatory, and punitive remedies, to wit: 1) declare that the acts and practices of the Police Department of Puerto Rico to be in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, and 1988; 2) declare that the acts and practices complained of are in violation of Puerto Rico Law 100 of June 30, 1959, as amended, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 146; Puerto Rico Law 115, supra; and Articles 1802, and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, supra.; 3) declare that Defendants\\' acts and practices deprived Plaintiff of his federal rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; 4) punitive damages in the amount of at least $300,000.00 as provided by Title VII, supra; 5) appropriate reimbursement for medical expenses and special damages; 6) costs including reasonable attorney\\'s fees as provided by Section 706 of Title VII, 29 P.R.

Said complaint was later referred to the United States Equal Opportunity Commission (EEOC), New York District Office. *172 The EEOC, New York Office, then referred the case to the San Juan District Office. Subsequently, on April 18, 2003, Plaintiff requested from the EEOC a \"right to sue\" letter. Thus, the matter was referred to the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division. On June 26, 2003, the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division issued the requested \"right to sue\" letter, postmarked on that same date. Finally, on September 25, 2003, Plaintiff filed the instant claim before this Court.\\nPending before the Court is defendants, Puerto Rico Police Department and Victor Rodriguez-Velez\\'s Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). (Docket No. 15). Defendants aver that dismissal is appropriate because the cause of action under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is time barred, the due process claims lack merit, and, thus, supplemental jurisdiction should not be asserted. Plaintiff, then requested an extension of time to file their opposition to Defendants\\' request, and the Court, even though the request was untimely pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(b), granted Plaintiff s request and provided him until Friday, July 30, 2004 to file his opposition. (Docket No. 18). However, Plaintiff disregarded the Court\\'s gratuitous gesture and proceeded to file his opposition in an untimely fashion on Saturday, July 31, 2004. (Docket No. 19). Accordingly, the Court will now consider Defendants\\' unopposed request for dismissal.[1]\\n\\nI. MOTION TO DISMISS UNDER RULE 12(b)(6)\\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party may, in response to an initial pleading, file a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. It is well-settled, however, that \"a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the Plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\" Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 102, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957); see also Ronald C. Brown v. Hot, Sexy, and Safer Productions, Inc., 68 F.3d 525 (1st Cir.1995); Miranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 44 (1st Cir.1991). The Court must accept as true all well pleaded factual averments contained in the complaint, while, at the same time, drawing all reasonable inferences from the allegation in favor of the Plaintiff. See McDonald v. Santa Fe *173 Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 276, 96 S. Ct. 2574, 2577, 49 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1976); Berrios v. Bristol Myers Squibb Caribbean Corp., 51 F.

However, \"because only well pleaded facts are taken as true, we will not accept a complainant\\'s unsupported conclusions or interpretations of law.\" Washington Legal Foundation v. Massachusetts Bar Foundation, 993 F.2d 962, 971 (1st Cir.1993).\\nWhen opposing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, \"a, Plaintiff cannot expect a trial court to do his homework for him.\" McCoy v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1991). Rather, the Plaintiff has an affirmative responsibility to put his best foot forward in an effort to present a legal theory that will support his claim. Id. at 23, citing Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 52. Thus, Plaintiff must set forth \"factual allegations, either direct or inferential, regarding each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable theory.\" Romero-Barcelo v. Hernandez-Agosto, 75 F.3d 23, 28 n. 2 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 514 (1st Cir.1988)). In sum a claim shall be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) only if it appears beyond doubt that the pleader can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would entitle the pleader to relief. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. at 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99.\\nNotwithstanding, the Court is not obligated to accept Plaintiff\\'s \"bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, periphrastic circumlocutions, and the like.\" Aulson, 83 F.3d at 3. The Court must only accept those facts that are \"well pleaded,\" limiting its inquiry into the allegations of the complaint. Litton Indus., Inc. v. Colon, 587 F.2d 70, 74 (1st Cir.1978). In sum, the Court\\'s focus should always be on \"whether a liberal reading of [the complaint] can reasonably admit of a claim[.]\" Id.; see also Rogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75 (1st Cir.1999).\\nA district court\\'s dismissal of a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) is reviewed de novo by the appeals court; as such court, the Court of Appeals \"accept[s] as true all well-pleaded factual averments and indulg[es] all reasonable inferences in the Plaintiff\\'s favor.\" Calderon-Ortiz v.

In cases in which the affirmative defense is based on the statute of limitations, the Court may grant a motion to dismiss if the pleader\\'s allegations leave no doubt that the asserted claim is time-barred. See, Street v. Vose, 936 F.2d 38, 39 (1st Cir.1991); Kali Seafood Inc. v. Howe Corp., 887 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1989). See also Estate of Alicano Ayala v. Philip Morris, Inc., 263 F. Supp. 2d 311, 315 (D.P.R.2003).\\n\\nII. DISCUSSION\\nIn the motion to dismiss, Defendants allege that this Court lacks jurisdiction over the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e claims because the ninety-day (90) limitation period for bringing a Title VII action after receipt of the right to sue letter in the federal forum was not complied by Plaintiff. Thus, according to Defendants, the instant claim is time barred. Moreover, Defendants allege that all other claims are also time barred for it is well settled law that state law statutes of limitations apply to suits in federal courts arising under \u00a7 1983, and that the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico borrows the one year state law statute of limitation afforded for personal injury claims. Defendants further argue that Plaintiff\\'s allegations relate to events that go back to July 14, 2000, more than a year before the filing of the complaint, and, therefore, the case is time barred by the statute. Defendants also contend that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process claims lack merit. They purport Plaintiff failed to make any reference whatsoever to which due process was being violated and how. Furthermore, the vague allegations alone cannot be sustained. Finally, Defendants request the Court to dismiss all supplemental jurisdiction claims given that Plaintiff failed to allege any cause of action under federal law.\\n\\nA. Title VII\\n1) Statute of Limitation\\nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1), a civil action must be commenced within ninety (90) days after the movant party receives the \"right-to-sue\" letter issued by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). That is to say, after a charge has been filed with the EEOC, there are two instances where a \"right-to-sue\" letter may be issued: first, during the administrative investigation, when the claimant requests in writing that a notice of \"right-to-sue\" be issued; and, second, after the EEOC\\'s disposition of a charge. Moreover, it is only upon issuance of the \"right-to-sue\" notice that the claimant will be deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies in order to be able to file an action in civil court. Finally, as stated above, once the claimant has received the notice, he or she only disposes of ninety (90) days to file said action. 42 USC \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). See also, Perez Cordero v. Wal-Mart PR, Inc., 235 F. Supp. 2d 95, 101 (D.P.R.2002).\\nDefendants assert that Sanchez\\'s cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e is time barred by the ninety-day (90) limitation period to bring suit under Title VII. (Docket No. 15 at 3). As defendant correctly points out, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) establishes that, once the EEOC makes the determination to dismiss an employee\\'s Title VII charges, the EEOC \"shall so notify the person aggrieved and within ninety days after the giving of such notice a civil action may be brought\" in District Court by the aggrieved employee. According to Plaintiff\\'s own allegations, the EEOC issued and postmarked the \"right-to-sue\" letter on June 26, 2003. (Docket No. 1 \u00b6 3, and Docket No. 4 \u00b6 4). The Court notes that the complaint initiating the present action was received and stamped by the Clerk\\'s Office of this Court *175 on September 25, 2003 \\x97 ninety one (91) days after the EEOC allegedly issued the \"right-to-sue\" letter. (Docket No. 1 at 1). Consequently, Plaintiff\\'s Title VII claims appear to be one day late, and, thus, time barred. However, FED.R.CIV P. 6(e) provides that: \"[w]henever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon him and the notice or paper is served upon him by mail, three (3) days shall be added to the prescribed period.\" Given that Plaintiff stated that the EEOC postmarked the \"right-to-sue\" letter on June 26, 2003, this Court can only infer that the EEOC sent its notice through the mail. (Docket No. 4 \u00b6 4). Therefore, this Court needs to, first, determine if Rule 6 is applicable to a Title VII Plaintiff wishing to file suit in a District Court when there is an allegation regarding the specific date of when the EEOC sent it, but no allegation as to the date of Plaintiff having received said notice.\\nNeither the First Circuit Court of Appeals nor any of its member districts have had an opportunity to address this issue directly. Nevertheless, three different Circuit Courts have considered the issue of whether Rule 6 provides a three day extension when a Title VII Plaintiff receives the \"right-to-sue\" letter by mail, thus, automatically increasing the limitation period established by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) from ninety (90) to ninety three (93) days. See Peete v. American Standard Graphic, 885 F.2d 331, 331-32 (6th Cir.1989); Mosel v. Hills Dept. Store, Inc., 789 F.2d 251 (3rd Cir.1986); Norris v. Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, 730 F.2d 682 (11th Cir.1984). All, the Third, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, upon certain proof of the date in which the claimant received the right to sue letter, have declined to grant such an extension. They emphasize that \"the reason for the three days is to account for the time required for delivery of the mail\" and given that \"the 90-day time period commences, [...,] upon receipt, and not upon the mailing of the `right-to-sue\\' notice[...] there is no reason to apply Rule 6(e).\" Norris, 730 F.2d at 683 (emphasis ours). Curiously, the non-applicability of Rule 6(e) to Title VII Plaintiff\\'s has been limited to those instances where the date in which the movant party received the \"right-to-sue\" letter is known, contrary to the instant case where the date of issue by the EEOC is known but not the date of receipt. Particularly, the Supreme Court made pellucidly clear that there is no justification for the view \"that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were to have different meaning in, or were not to apply to, Title VII litigation.\" Baldwin County Welcome Center v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 104 S. Ct. 1723, 1725, 80 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1984).\\nBased on Baldwin County Welcome Center, 466 U.S. 147, 104 S. Ct. 1723, 80 L. Ed. 2d 196, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals stated (albeit in dictum) that:\\nthe Supreme Court has suggested that Rule 6(e) is applicable in the present context [when a Title VII plaintiff receives the right to sue letter by mail] if the parties dispute the date on which the Plaintiff received notice of the EEOC\\'s determination. In that situation, Rule 6(e) would create a presumption that the notice was received three days after it was mailed.\\nMosel, 789 F.2d at 253 (emphasis ours). Given the strong language of the Supreme Court in Baldwin County Welcome Center, 466 U.S. 147, 104 S. Ct. 1723, 80 L. Ed. 2d 196, and the fact that the rationale for the application of Rule 6, as the Eleventh Circuit explains, is precisely \"to account for the time required for delivery of the mail,\" Norris, 730 F.2d at 683 (emphasis ours), *176 this Court agrees with the rationale expressed by the Third Circuit in Mosel, 789 F.2d at 253, and adopts said reasoning to the case herein being litigated.\\nIn the case at bar, even though the EEOC issued the \"right-to-sue\" letter on June 26, 2003, it is Plaintiff\\'s contention that he received such notice \"a few days latter.\" (Docket No. 1 at \u00b6 3). As explained above, in cases in which the date of receipt is either disputed or cannot be established, Rule 6 creates a presumption that the communication was received by Plaintiff three days after it was issued by the EEOC. Consequently, from Plaintiff\\'s allegations, the Court must determine that Sanchez received the \"right-to-sue\" letter on June 29, 2003, three days after it was sent and postmarked by the EEOC. Therefore, Plaintiff had until September 27th of 2003 to file the instant suit. Having Plaintiff filed his claim on September 25th, the Court has but one alternative and that is to declare that the instant cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e has been timely filed.\\n2) Physical Disability &amp; Title VII\\nPlaintiff further alleges that the acts of discrimination perpetrated against him were motivated by his physical disability.[2] (Docket No. 1 at \u00b6 12). Plaintiff thus seeks relief for the discriminatory actions allegedly suffered under to Title VII, 42 U.S.C \u00a7 2000e. Title 42 of the United States Code provides that it is an unlawful employment practice to discriminate on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2. Title VII is unquestionably silent regarding discrimination motivated by a person\\'s physical or mental impediment. Such claims are contemplated, in turn, by the American with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, and not by 42 U.S.C \u00a7 2000e. Provided that Plaintiff Sanchez has neither alleged that he was discriminated against due to his \"race, color, religion, sex or national origin\" nor has he brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, he has failed to state a discrimination claim upon which relief may be granted. Accordingly, Plaintiff\\'s Title VII discrimination claims due to physical disability are DISMISSED.\\n3) Retaliation &amp; Title VII\\nPlaintiff alleges that defendant Police Department of Puerto Rico, through the acts of Lieutenant Fernando Garcia Lugo and Lieutenant Dennis Orego Rodriguez, took retaliatory actions against him for the filing of an administrative complaint denouncing unlawful employment practices. (Docket No. 4 at \u00b6 21). The acts allegedly carried forth by Defendant are violative of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) which states that: \"it shall be unlawful employment practice to discriminate against any employee because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this subchapter.\"\\nAlthough Title VII does requires, as a predicate to any civil action, that the moving party initially file an administrative charge with the EEOC, it does not say explicitly that the Court suit must be circumscribed to only that alleged in the agency complaint. See generally, Clockedile v. N.H. Dept. of Corr., 245 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2005); see also Jorge v. Rumsfeld, 404 F.3d 556 (1st Cir.2005). Accordingly, the Courts have allowed court claims that go beyond the claim or claims made at the *177 agency level. Id Consequently, the First Circuit Court of Appeals has established the \"reasonably related\" test in retaliatory claims emergent from a claimant\\'s filing of an administrative charge. Id. This, in turn, translates to the preservation of retaliation claims \"so long as the retaliation is reasonably related to and grows out of the discrimination complained of to the agency[.]\" Clockedile, 245 F.3d at 6. Thus, the Court cannot deem plaintiff\\'s retaliation claim as time bated pursuant to the abovementioned criteria. Neither is it necessary to exhaust\"administrative EEOC charges in \"reasonably related\" causes of action to those claim already filed in Court. See Clockedile, 245 F.3d at 6 (retaliation claims that are reasonably related to the filed complaint are preserved and, consequently, do not require EEOC exhaustion).\\nThe Court is well aware that the Eleventh Amendment bars a suit brought in federal courts for monetary damages against states, unless the state being sued waives its immunity or consents to be sued. This protection renders states, including Puerto Rico, immune from claims brought in federal courts by citizens of the same or any other state.[3]Metcalf &amp; Eddy v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Authority, 991 F.2d 935, 939 (1st Cir.1993). This immunity does not solely protect the State. Rather, since a State only exists through its instrumentalities, Eleventh Amendment immunity also extends to arms or \"alter egos\" of the State, which includes the officers acting on behalf of the state. See Ainsworth Aristocrat Int\\'l Pty. Ltd. v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 818 F.2d 1034, 1036 (1st Cir.1987); see also, Mount Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1977). As with claims against the Commonwealth itself, \"the claims in federal court for damages against the Police Department are precluded by the Eleventh Amendment,\"since they must, if successful, be satisfied from the coffers of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" Reyes v. Supervisor of DEA, 834 F.2d 1093, 1097-98 (1st Cir.1987). \"[I]t is settled law that the Puerto Rico Police Department is an alter ego of the state and cannot be sued in federal court.\" Cestero v. Rosa, 996 F. Supp. 133, 142-43 (D.P.R. 1998) (citing Rivera v. Medina, 963 F. Supp. 78, 82 (D.P.R.1997); Reyes v. Supervisor of DEA, 647 F. Supp. 1509, 1513 (D.P.R.1986) modified on other gorunds, 834 F.2d 1093 (1st Cir.1987)).\\nNevertheless, there are some narrow exceptions to the Eleventh Amendment immunity. One of these exception is when Congress has \"unequivocally expresses its intent to abrogate the immunity\" and has acted \"pursuant to a valid *178 exercise of power.\" Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68, 106 S. Ct. 423, 426, 88 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1985). Actions pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e fall within this exception. First, the Supreme Court has determine that in Title VII cases \"the threshold fact of congressional authorization to sue the State as employer is clearly present.\\'\" Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 96 S. Ct. 2666, 49 L. Ed. 2d 614 (1976) (citation omitted); see also E spinal-Dominguez v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 352 F.3d 490 (1st Cir.2003) (discussing the applicability of the Fitzpatrick ruling to the case of Puerto Rico). Title 42 of the United State Code Section 2000e(b) defines the term employer to mean:\\na person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees for each working day in each of the twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such a person, but such term does not include (1) the United States, a corporation wholly owned by the Government of the United States, an Indian tribe, or any department or agency of the District of Columbia subject by statute to procedures of the competitive service (as defined in section 2102 of Title 5), or (2) a bona fide private membership club (other than a labor organization) which is exempt from taxation under section 501(c) of Title 26, except that during the first year after March 24, 1972, person having fewer than twenty-five employees (and their agents) shall not be considered employers.\\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b). A reading of such definition indicates that the States as well as their alter egos, in so far as they are not expressly excluded from the definition mentioned above, are employers for purposes of actions brought against them under Title VII. This, in turn, demonstrates Congress\\'s intention to abrogate the State\\'s Eleventh Amendment in immunity for Title VII litigation.\\nSecond, in Fitzpatrick the Court considered the issue of whether Congress \"possess[es] the constitutional power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to authorize [...] Title VII damage actions against the State.\" Fitzpatrick, 427 U.S. at 445, 96 S. Ct. at 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d. at 614. The Court stated \"that the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies, see Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L. Ed. 842 (1890), are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. at 451, 96 S. Ct. at 2669, 49 L. Ed. 2d 614. It is clear, thus, the validity of Congress\\'s exercise of power when abrogating the States\\' Eleventh Amendment Immunity in Title VII litigations under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Consequently, given that the two requirements established in Green for the operation of the exception have been met, neither the States nor the State\\'s alter egos can invoke Eleventh Amendment Immunity as a protection against suit brought against them under Title VII. See Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68, 106 S. Ct. 423, 426, 88 L. Ed. 2d 371.\\nIn the case at bar, pursuant to Plaintiff\\'s allegations a valid claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3 for the retaliatory actions taken against him by Defendant are properly pled.[4] The Defendant in this *179 case is the Police Department of Puerto Rico which is an alter ego of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and, as such, should be entitled to the immunities afforded to States and are \"alter egos\" under the Eleventh Amendment. Albeit, having Congress manifested its intent to abrogate the State\\'s Eleventh Amendment immunity for the purposes of Title VII litigation, as well as having the Supreme Court accepted such abrogation as a valid exercise of Congressional power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, neither the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico nor its alter ego the Puerto Rico Police Department are immune from the herein Title VII actions brought against it. Therefore, in the present case, the Police Department of Puerto Rico cannot avail itself of Eleventh Amendment immunity to defeat Plaintiff\\'s Title VII claim of retaliation and, for that reason, Defendant\\'s motion to dismiss in relation to Plaintiff\\'s retaliation claim against co-Defendant Police Department of Puerto Rico is DENIED.[5]\\nProvided that Puerto Rico Law 115 of December 20, 1991, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 197a prohibits any employer from:\\ndischarg[ing], threaten[ing], or discriminat[ing] against an employee regarding the terms, conditions, compensation, location, benefits or privileges of the employment should the employee offer or attempt to offer, verbally or in writing, any testimony, expression or information before a legislative, administrative or judicial forum in Puerto Rico, when such expressions are not of a defamatory character nor constitute disclosure of privileged information established by law[,]\\na statute parallel to the federal statute, the Court cannot dismiss this supplemental jurisdiction claim while the retaliation claim under Title VII remains alive within this Court\\'s jurisdiction. Accordingly, Defendant\\'s motion to dismiss in relation to Plaintiff\\'s retaliation claim against co-Defendant Police Department of Puerto Rico is DENIED.\\nHowever, Defendant\\'s motion to dismiss in regards to the retaliation claim, both federal and state, against co-Defendant Victor Rodriguez Velez is hereby GRANTED. Plaintiff, in his complaint and amendment complaint, has limited himself to identifying co-Defendant Victor Rodriguez Velez\\'s friendship and family relationship with Lieutenant Fernando Garcia Lugo and Lieutenant Dennis Orego Rodriguez which, were the agents of the Police Department of Puerto Rico responsible for the retaliatory acts allegedly perpetrated against him. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to implicate facts which may grant a remedy against co-defendant Victor Rodriguez Velez. It is evident to this Court that, pursuant to the facts alleged in the complaint, co-Defendant Victor Rodriguez Velez took no part in such retaliatory actions and that an action against him should not be sustained. Therefore, the case against Rodriguez Velez is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE as insufficient pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).[6]\\n\\n\\n*180 B) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\\n\\n1) Statute of Limitation\\nCivil rights actions brought forth pursuant to \u00a7 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 do not have a specific statute of limitations. Consequently, courts have been encouraged to, and must apply, the state\\'s statute of limitations which is most appropriate to the particular \u00a7 1983 claim. The most analogous statute of limitations period for a \u00a7 1983 claim is the one for personal injury actions, which in Puerto Rico is one year. See, Ruiz-Sulsona v. Univ. of Puerto Rico, 334 F.3d 157, 160 (1st Cir.2003); Rodriguez-Narvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 41-42 (1st Cir.1990); Rivera Sanchez v. Autoridad de Energia Electrica, 360 F. Supp. 2d 302, 307 (D.P.R. 2005).\\nThe running of the statute of limitations period for a claim of this nature can be tolled by any extrajudicial claim made by the debtor, and by any act of acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor. Art. 1873 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code specifically proscribes that \"[the p]rescription of actions is interrupted by their institutions before the courts, by extrajudicial claim of the creditor, and by any act of acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.\" 31 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 5303 (1990). In order to set the standard for what constitutes an extrajudicial claim, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has relied on the definition provided by the renowned commentator to the Civil Code Diez Picazo. \"In principle, claim stands for demand or notice. That is: it is an act for which the holder of a substantive right addresses the passive subject of said right, demanding that he adopt the required conduct. The claim, then, is a pretension in a technical sense.\" Rodriguez Narvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 44 (1st Cir.1990); Diaz de Diana v. A.J.A.S. Ins. Co., 110 P.R.Dec. 471, 476 (1980); Secretario Del Trabajo v. Finetex, 116 D.P.R. 823, 827, 1986 WL 376826 (1986).\\nIn the present case, according to Plaintiff\\'s own allegations, the events that give *181 rise to Plaintiff\\'s due process and equal protection claims under Section 1983 took place between April, 2000 and May, 2002. (Docket 4 at \u00b6 11 to \u00b6 21). A period of a year, four months, and twenty two days had elapsed from the time the last alleged incident occurred, on May 3, 2002, and the filing of the complaint on September 25, 2003. Consequently, such claims are time barred. In addition, Plaintiff took no further actions within the proscribed statute of limitation of one year, after the events in question occurred, which could have interrupted the time period for him to file suit pursuant to \u00a7 1983.\\nPlaintiff should be aware that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has ruled that the filing of an administrative complaint will not toll the running statute of limitations for tort actions nor violations of constitutional rights, provided that an administrative agency, such as the Puerto Rico Police Department\\'s Internal Affairs Office or the EEOC, does not possess jurisdiction over such matters. See Cintron v. E.L.A, 127 D.P.R. 582, 595, 1990 WL 658719 (1990); Delgado Rodriguez v. Nazario, 121 D.P.R. 347, 1988 WL 580813 (1988); Leon-Nogueras, 964 F. Supp. 585, 588-89 (1st Cir.1997). In specific terms, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has explained that,\\nan action before the Department of Labor and the judicial action do not pursue identical goals. The action before the Department of Labor, the way that it is regulated, does not provide means for revealing the intention or desire of the creditor of conserving and demanding the right to be compensated for the damages suffered. Because of that, the exercise [of an administrative complaint] does not qualify as a pretension capable of tolling the running of the statute of limitations for the civil action.\\nCintron, 127 D.P.R. at 595. Therefore, for all practical purposes, a plaintiff that files an administrative complaint for several causes of action, tolls the statute of limitations for all the causes should the agency be able to provide him all the remedies sought against the defendants, and should he have properly alleged at the agency level a \u00a7 1983 civil rights claim based on federal constitutional causes of action, with injunctive remedy and request damages. But, simply stated, the EEOC cannot grant the remedy now sought and, even if it could, the interruption status ends with the date of the filing, and the statute of limitations begins to run again for a year and fails to last for the duration of the administrative action. Cintron, 127 D.P.R. at 595. Plaintiff should keep in mind that \"the pendency of an administrative proceeding does not maintain the section 1983 claim in a state of suspended animation.\"[7]Leon-Nogueras, 964 F.Supp. at 589; see also Gonzalez Garcia v. Puerto Rico Elec. Power, 214 F. Supp. 2d 194, 201 (D.P.R.2002); Secretario Del Trabajo, 116 D.P.R. at 823; Galib Frangie v. El Vocero, 138 D.P.R. 560, 1995 WL 905884 at *3 (1995).\\nThe instant cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is barred, therefore, by the applicable one year limitations period. For purposes of this case \"even if the filing of the [administrative complaint] ... had constituted an extrajudicial claim that tolled the statute of limitations for the *182 section 1983 claim, the most that this could have done would be to have restarted the running of the one-year statute of limitations.\" Leon-Nogueras, 964 F.Supp. at 589 (emphasis ours) (quote based on local law under the local case of Cintron, 127 P.R. Dec. at 595). Plaintiff filed an administrative complaint with the Puerto Rico Department of Labor on September 19, 2000, which, at most, only interrupted the statute of limitations until the year September 2001. Plaintiff presents no further evidence or allegation in the complaint that would indicate that he issued subsequent extrajudicial claims interrupting the statute of limitations until September 25, 2003, date in which plaintiff filed the instant claim. Instead, what the complaint does in fact show is that plaintiff decided to wait, nearly three years, until he was notified with a right to sue letter. Accordingly, plaintiff\\'s allegations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 are time barred given that the filing of an administrative complaint with the Department of Labor, EEOC Local Office, fails to toll in any way the running of the statute of limitations for claims pursuant as to a civil rights complaint under \u00a7 1983 against the natural persons individual co-defendants. See Leon-Nogueras, 964 F.Supp. at 589; Cintron, 127 D.P.R. at 595; Galib Frangie v. El Vocero, Id.\\nWith respect to all other plaintiff\\'s allegations relating to the violations of his Fourth Amendment constitutional rights against individual co-defendants, the same principle applies. These claims are also time-barred. Plaintiff\\'s allegations do not survive defendant\\'s motion to dismiss by reason that his constitutional claims are within claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Pursuant to the above, defendants motion to dismiss is hereby GRANTED as to the Fourth Amendment claims. Given the Court\\'s ruling in this case, the Court need not to examine any further the rest of the allegations presented by the defendants in the Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 10).\\n2) Property Right\\nSection 1983 of Title 42 of the United State Code imposes civil liability upon \"every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. As the text of Section 1983 clearly shows, and the United State Supreme Court reiterates, Section 1983 \"is not itself a source of substantive rights,\" but merely provides \"a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.\" Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 393, 109 S. Ct. 1865, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1989) (citing Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 144 n. 3, 99 S. Ct. 2689, 2694, n. 3, 61 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1979)). Therefore, \"the first inquiry in any \u00a7 1983 suit, [...] is whether the Plaintiff has been deprived of a right secured by the Constitution and laws.\" Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. at 140, 99 S. Ct. at 2692.\\nIn the case at bar, Sanchez, by asserting a claim under Section 1983, invokes the protection of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.[8] On September 3, 1992, Sanchez *183 started working, as an undercover agent, for the Puerto Rico Police Department.[9] (Docket 4 at \u00b6 11). He was then transferred, at his own request, to the Guanica Maritime Office, on March 1999. (Docket 4 at \u00b6 11). His direct superior in Guanica was Co-Defendant Lieutenant Victor Rodriguez Velez. (Docket 4 at \u00b6 10). Plaintiff alleges that, once in Guanica, Co-Defendant Rodriguez Velez did everything in his power to prevent Sanchez from occupying the position to which he was transferred.[10] (Docket No. 4 at \u00b6 12 \u00b6 20). Defendants\\' actions included transferring Plaintiff out of the Guanica Maritime Office and reassigning him to the San Juan Field Operation Unit. (Docket No. 4 at \u00b6 19). It is only through these allegation that Plaintiff claims what this Court can only assume is that Defendant has deprived him of his property right without the due process of law. However, given that Plaintiff\\'s claims are time barred, this Court does not have to decide whether Defendant\\'s actions violated Sanchez\\'s constitutional rights. Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, Plaintiff\\'s due process and equal protection claims under Section 1983 are DISMISSED.\\n3) Malicious Prosecution\\nPlaintiff purports to request relief against defendants for violations to his right to be free form malicious prosecution and unreasonable searches and seizures \\x97 violations which, he contends, are actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In essence, he argues that the defendants seeking the commencement of criminal proceedings against him, which were eventually dismissed by State Court, is tantamount to malicious prosecution. According to Plaintiff\\'s allegations, the filing of false criminal charges against him took place in late 2003, well within the \u00a7 1983 statute of limitations. (Docket No. 4 at \u00b6 21D). Nevertheless, even when this is the only \u00a7 1983 claim that is not time barred,[11]*184 Plaintiff\\'s malicious prosecution claim must be dismissed.\\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, the federal courts \"shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\" Moreover, section 1983\\'s purpose \"Ms to provide a remedy in federal court in protection of federal rights.\" Ramos Bonilla v. Vivoni del Valle, 336 F. Supp. 2d 159, 166 (D.Puerto Rico 2004) (quoting Birnbaum v. Trussell, 371 F.2d 672 (2nd Cir.1966)). Section 1983 was particularly created to \"[d]eter[] state actors from using [the] badge of their authority to deprive individuals of their federally guaranteed rights and provide relief to victims whenever such deterrence fails.\" Id.; see also Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U.S. 158, 112 S. Ct. 1827, 118 L. Ed. 2d 504 (1992); City of Newport v. Fact Concerts Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 101 S. Ct. 2748, 69 L. Ed. 2d 616 (1981); Reuben H. Donnelley Corp. v. Brauer, 275 Ill.App.3d 300, 211 Ill. Dec. 779, 655 N.E.2d 1162 (1995).\\nSection 1983 authorizes actions for equitable relief and\/or damages against \"every person who under color of any [...] custom or usage, of any State or Territory [...] subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of the United States or other person [...] to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Thus, as explained above in detail, in order to state a claim cognizable under Section 1983, Plaintiff must allege \"that some person has deprived him of a [constitutional or a] federal [statutory] right.\" Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S. Ct. 1920, 64 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1980). To prevail in an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, plaintiff must satisfy two prongs. First, he must prove that he was deprived of a right, immunity, or privilege secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535, 101 S. Ct. 1908, 68 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1981); Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 140, 99 S. Ct. 2689, 61 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1979); Voutour v. Vitale, 761 F.2d 812, 819 (1st Cir.1985). Second, he must have been deprived of his right, immunity or privilege, by a person acting under color of state law. Id. Accordingly, two distinct elements are to be addressed. First, there must have been a violation of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States and, defendants\\' conduct must have caused the deprivation of plaintiffs rights. Id.; see also Soto v. Carrasquillo, 878 F. Supp. 324, 326-327 (D.P.R.1995).\\nThe malicious prosecution cause of action permits damages for a deprivation of liberty pursuant to a legal process.[12] However, \"the law is settled that a garden variety claim of malicious prosecution garbed in the regalia of \u00a7 1983 must fail. There is no substantive due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from malicious prosecution and the availability of a plainly adequate remedy under the [state] law defeats the possibility of a procedural due process claim\" in the instant case.[13]Ramos *185 Bonilla, 336 F.Supp.2d at 166; see also Meehan v. Town of Plymouth, 167 F.3d 85, 88 (1st Cir.1999) (citing Roche v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249 (1st Cir.1996) (internal citations omitted)). Consequently, in order to transform a malicious prosecution claim into a claim cognizable pursuant to \u00a7 1983 in a state that has a remedy for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must demonstrate a deprivation of a separate and independent constitutional right. See Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir.2001). Particularly, in the specific case of malicious prosecution, the First Circuit Court of Appeals has established that, in order to determine whether a federal protected right has been violated, the plaintiff has to establish that the criminal charges at issue must have imposed some deprivation of liberty consistent with the concept of seizure. Britton v. Maloney, 196 F.3d 24, 28-29 (1st Cir.1999) (citations omitted).\\nSection 1983 \"is not in itself a source of substantive rights\" but \"a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.\" Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266 at 271, 114 S. Ct. 807, 127 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1994). Hence, the plaintiff has to identify the constitutional right allegedly infringed. Id. (citations omitted). The Fourteenth Amendment, in its procedural due process aspect, as is clearly plaintiff\\'s claim, cannot serve as the vehicle for plaintiff\\'s assertion of the infringement of his constitutional rights, pursuant to the alleged malicious prosecution he was subjected to, since the plaintiff has an adequate remedy for malicious prosecution pursuant to state law. See 31 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 5141; see also Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d at 53 (\"[n]o procedural due process claim can flourish in this soil because [Puerto Rico] provides an adequate remedy for malicious prosecution.\"). Furthermore, the malicious prosecution claim also fails the substantive due process aspect of the Fourteenth Amendment since the \"`substantive due process may not furnish a constitutional peg on which to hang\\' a federal malicious prosecution tort.\" Id. (quoting Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. at 271 n. 4, 114 S. Ct. 807.) However, \"[w]here a particular Amendment `provides and explicit textual source of constitutional protection\\' against a particular sort of government behavior, `that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substantive due process must be the guide for analyzing these claims.\\'\" Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. at 273, 114 S. Ct. 807 (quoting Graham v. Connor 490 U.S. 386 at 395, 109 S. Ct. 1865, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1989)). Therefore, the Fourth Amendment could potentially constitute an adequate \"constitutional peg\" where a plaintiff subjected to a malicious prosecution may \"hang\" his \u00a7 1983 claim. See Ramos Bonilla 336 F.Supp.2d at 166-67; Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d at 54; Meehan v. Town of Plymouth, 167 F.3d at 88 (citing Albright v. Oliver 510 U.S. at 271, 114 S. Ct. 807).\\nThe First Circuit has established that \"[f]or a public official to transgress the Fourth Amendment through the initiation and pursuit of criminal charges, the prosecution of said charges must, at a bare minimum, have occasioned a deprivation *186 of liberty consistent with the concept of a seizure.\" Id. at 54 (citing Britton v. Maloney, 196 F.3d 24, at 28 (citing Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff, 63 F.3d 110, 116 (2nd Cir.1995)) (emphasis added)). In other words, a seizure actionable under the Fourth Amendment only occurs when a state official, under color of authority, restrains the liberty of a citizen. See Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d at 55. For example, a legal obligation to appear in court does not impose any restrictions on a person\\'s liberty and is insufficient to establish a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d at 56; Britton v. Maloney, 196 F.3d at 29-30. In the instant case, the first requirement is not met due to Plaintiff Sanchez not having alleged that he was deprived of his liberty as a consequence of Defendant\\'s actions. In fact, Plaintiff admitted in the complaint that the charges filed by Defendant were dismissed. Plaintiff also fails to allege that Defendant interfered in any way with the judicial process. The most that can be inferred from Plaintiff\\'s allegations in the complaint is that Defendant used the judicial system to further his discriminatory purposes against him. However, in the \"misuse of the legal process alone will not be enough to sustain a claim.\" Torres v. Superintendent of Police of Puerto Rico, 893 F.2d 404, 410 (1st Cir.1990). Consequently, Plaintiff\\'s contentions are not sufficient to entertain a claim for malicious prosecution under Section 1983. Furthermore, the laws of the commonwealth of Puerto Rico offer Plaintiff and adequate remedy for his malicious prosecution claim in 31 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 5141,[14] and for that reason this case fails to satisfy the second requirement established by Torres. For the reasons stated above Plaintiff\\'s malicious prosecution claim is DISMISSED. In sum, the Court finds that plaintiff has failed to allege facts to sustain a Fourth Amendment violation, pursuant to his malicious prosecution claim, as such, plaintiff failed the very first prong of any claim pursuant to \u00a7 1983 which is to establish an infringement of a federal right, and dismissal on this matter must be GRANTED in favor of defendants.\\n\\nIII. Remaining State Law Claims\\nThe only remaining state law claims are those under Articles 1802, and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, 31 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 5141, and 5142. However, both causes of action proscribed by these articles for personal injuries, as discussed above, center around a one year statute of limitations. Any claims under Law 100, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 146, is also time barred since said claim is within the nature of damages being the statute of limitations one of one year. See Olmo v. Young &amp; Rubicam, 110 P.R. Dec. 740 (1981). Accordingly, and as amply explained above, a period of a year, four months, and two days had elapsed from the time the last alleged incident occurred before the filing of the complaint, and the fact that the prescriptive period was never interrupted (see discussion above), the remaining supplemental claims are time barred.\\n\\nIV. Conclusion\\nBased on the aforementioned reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Defendants\\' motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 15). Plaintiff\\'s discrimination, and physical disability claims pursuant to Title VII are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE; plaintiff\\'s retaliatiion *187 claims against co-defendant Victor Rodriguez Velez is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE; finally, all of plaintiffs claims pursuant to Section 1983 (property right and malicious prosecution) are DIMISSED WITH PREJUDICE due to plaintiffs failure to interrupt the running of the statute of limitations pursuant to claims under \u00a7 1983.[15] Plaintiff\\'s supplemental local claims, except that brought pursuant to Law 115, are all time barred, and, thus DISMISSED WITH PREJDICE. However, co-defendant the Puerto Rico Police Department\\'s Motion to Dismiss as to Plaintiff\\'s retaliation claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3 is DENIED.\\nCo-defendant the Police Department of Puerto Rico is granted TWENTY DAYS from the issuance of this order to answer the complaint. NO EXTENSIONS ARE TO BE GRANTED.\\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  \"In an era of burgeoning case loads and thronged dockets, effective case management has become an essential tool for handling civil litigation.\" O\\'Connell v. Hyatt Hotels of Puerto Rico, 357 F.3d 152 (1st Cir.2004). It is Rule 16 which provides the Court with devices, like a scheduling order, necessary to manage its docket. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 16. Moreover, in order for Rule 16(b) to be effective, the Courts cannot allow litigants to treat scheduling orders \"as a frivolous piece of paper idly entered, which can be cavalierly disregarded without peril\" as has been abused in the instant case. See O\\'Connell, 357 F.3d at 155. \"[T]he effective administration of justice requires that trial courts possess the capability to manage their own affairs\". Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43, 111 S. Ct. 2123, 115 L. Ed. 2d 27 (1991), quoting Chamorro v. Puerto Rican Cars. Inc., 304 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2002). Furthermore, counsel do not run the Court. Thus, parties have an \"unflagging duty to comply with clearly communicated case-management orders\". Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir.1998) (emphasis added). It is self-evident that \"courts cannot function if litigants may, with impunity, disobey lawful orders.\" Chamorro v. Puerto Rican Cars, Inc., 304 F.3d at 5, HMG Prop. Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc., 847 F.2d 908, 916 (1st Cir.1988). The Court finds that plaintiffs have failed to be reasonably diligent. The Court does not have the \"obligation to play nursemaid to indifferent parties.\" Pinto v. Universidad De Puerto Rico, 895 F.2d 18, 19 (1st Cir.1990).\\n[2]  Plaintiff\\'s physical disability is the result of a surgical intervention that put three orthopedic screws on his right knee. (Docket No. 1 \u00b6 12)\\n[3]  In an unbroken string of cases over the last two decades, the First Circuit consistently has held that Puerto Rico is considered a \"State\" for Eleventh Amendment purposes, and therefore, Eleventh Amendment applies with full force to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. See, e.g., Negron Gaztambide v. Hernandez Torres, 145 F.3d 410 (1st Cir.1998); Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth., 991 F.2d 935, 939 n. 3 (1st Cir.1993); Aviles-Martinez v. Monroig, 963 F.2d 2, 8 (1st Cir.1992); De Leon Lopez v. Corporacion Insular de Seguros, 931 F.2d 116, 121 (1st Cir. 1991); Culebras Enterprises Corp. v. Rivera Rios, 813 F.2d 506, 516 (1st Cir.1987); Ainsworth Aristocrat Int\\'l Pty., Ltd. v. Tourism Co. of P.R., 818 F.2d 1034 (1st Cir.1987); Fernandez v. Chardon, 681 F.2d 42, 59 n. 13 (1st Cir.1982) (Puerto Rico enjoys the full benefits of the Eleventh Amendment); Ezratty v. Com. of Puerto Rico, 648 F.2d 770, 776 n. 7 (1st Cir.1981) (\"The principles of the Eleventh Amendment, which protect a state from suit without its consent, are fully applicable to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"); Litton Indus., Inc. v. Colon, 587 F.2d 70 (1st Cir.1978) (action against Puerto Rico barred by Eleventh Amendment, unless immunity is expressly abrogated by Congress acting under the Fourteenth Amendment).\\n[4]  Retaliatory claims are separate, distinct violations of the law and do not depend on the outcome of the merits of a substantive claim under Title VII. See Mesnick v. General Elec., Co., 950 F.2d 816, 827 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985, 112 S. Ct. 2965, 119 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1992); see also Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, 105 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1997); Oliveras Sifre v. Department of Health, 38 F. Supp. 2d 91, 102 (D.Puerto Rico 1999).\\n[5]  It must be noted that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a \"state\" for the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment. See footnote 3, infra. Hence, it is covered by the abrogation of such immunity as has been held as to all states pursuant to Fitzpatrick, 427 U.S. 445, 96 S. Ct. 2666, 49 L. Ed. 2d 614, and Espinal-Dominguez, 352 F.3d 490.\\n[6]  Furthermore, most courts have held there is no federal cause of action against natural persons under Title VII, and other federal discrimination cases. As this district has previously explained:\\n\\nAlthough the First Circuit has yet to decide whether a Title VII plaintiff may maintain a suit against an individual in his personal capacity, most circuits have held that no personal liability can be attached to agents or supervisors under Title VII. See Serapion v. Martinez, 119 F.3d 982 (1st Cir.1997) (declining to address the issue of individual liability); but see Gastineau v. Fleet Mortgage Corp., 137 F.3d 490, 493 (7th Cir.1998) (citing Williams v. Banning, 72 F.3d 552 (7th Cir.1995), where no individual liability under Title VII was found); Lissau v. Southern Food Serv., Inc., 159 F.3d 177, 180-81 (4th Cir.1998) (no individual liability under Title VII); Wathen v. General Elec. Co., 115 F.3d 400, 405-06 (6th Cir.1997) (same); Haynes v. Williams, 88 F.3d 898 (10th Cir.1996) (same); Dici v. Com. of Pa., 91 F.3d 542 (3rd Cir.1996) (same); Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295 (2nd Cir.1995) (same); Gary v. Long, 313 U.S.App. D.C. 403, 59 F.3d 1391 (D.C.Cir.1995) (same); Lenhardt v. Basic Institute of Technology, Inc., 55 F.3d 377 (8th Cir.1995) (same); Smith v. Lomax, 45 F.3d 402 (11th Cir. 1995) (same); Grant v. Lone Star Co., 21 F.3d 649 (5th Cir.1994) (same); Miller v. Maxwell\\'s International, Inc., 991 F.2d 583 (9th Cir.1993) (same). Like the majority of the circuit courts, this District has generally held that individual defendants are not liable under Title VII. See Canabal v. Aramark Corp., 48 F. Supp. 2d 94, 95-98 (D.Puerto Rico 1999) (Pieras, J.); Acevedo Vargas v. Colon, 2 F.Supp.2d at 206; Pineda v. Almacenes Pitusa, Inc., 982 F. Supp. 88, 92-93 (D.Puerto Rico 1997); Hernandez v. Wangen, 938 F. Supp. 1052 (D.Puerto Rico 1996); Anonymous v. Legal Services Corporation, 932 F. Supp. 49, 50-51 (D.Puerto Rico 1996).\\nThe Court is compelled by the reasoning of previous decisions within this District. Title VII\\'s statutory structure suggests that Congress did not intend to impose individual liability over supervisors or agents of employer.\\nPadilla Cintron v. Rossello Gonzalez, 247 F. Supp. 2d 48 (D.P.R.2003). See generally the well developed and persuasive analysis of District Judge Laffitte in Flamand v. American International Group, Inc., 876 F. Supp. 356, 361-64 (D.P.R.1994).\\n[7]  A contrario sensu a \"suspended animation\" occurs under an EEOC charge with one important distinction-the statute calls for \"suspended animation\" against the employer, in this case, the Police Department, but not the natural persons sued herein in the individual capacities, for a definite period of time after the issuance of the right to sue letter. See generally, Love v. Pullman, 404 U.S. 522, 526, 92 S. Ct. 616, 30 L. Ed. 2d 679 (1972); Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u00a7 706(c), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-5.\\n[8]  It must be noted that the Supreme Court held in Ex. Bd. of Eng., Arch., and Sur. v. Flores de Otero, 426 U.S. 572, 96 S. Ct. 2264, 49 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1976), that \"it is clear now, however, that the protections accorded by either the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment or the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment apply to residents of Puerto Rico.\" The Court recognized the applicability of these guarantees as long ago as its decisions in Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 283-284, 21 S. Ct. 770, 785, 45 L. Ed. 1088 (1901), and Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298, 312-313, 42 S. Ct. 343, 348, 66 L. Ed. 627 (1922). Both the Supreme Court and the First Circuit \"thus far ha[ve] declined to say whether it is the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth which provides the protection.\" Examining Board of Engineers, Architects, and Surveyors, v. Maria C. Flores de Otero and Sergio Perez Nogueiro, supra. The Fourteenth, as well as the Fifth Amendment, provide a due process clause. Both clauses have exactly the same language, the only significant difference is that the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause is directed to the states, while the Fifth Amendment is not. In addition, the Fourteenth Amendment includes the equal protection clause which the Fifth Amendment does not include. However, in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S. Ct. 693, 98 L. Ed. 884 (1954), a case challenging \"the validity of segregation in the public schools of the District of Columbia,\" addressed this issue and decided that \"the concepts of equal protection and due process, both stemming from our American ideal of fairness, are not mutually exclusive. The `equal protection of the laws\\' is a more explicit safeguard of prohibited unfairness than `due process of law,\\' and, therefore, we do not imply that the two are always interchangeable phrases. But, as this Court has recognized, discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.\" Consequently, the issue of whether plaintiff\\'s claims should be asserted under the Fifth or the Fourteenth Amendment is ultimately inconsequential.\\n[9]  From Plaintiff allegations it is uncertain the geographical area in which he worked as undercover agent for the Police Department of Puerto Rico.\\n[10]  There is nothing in the record that reflects to which position plaintiff was transferred to at the Guanica Maritime Office.\\n[11]  The EEOC claim is designed to exhaust administrative actions against the employer, in this case the Police Department, not for \u00a7 1983 claims against individual persons acting as supervisors or agents of the employer.

Coleman, U.S. E.E.O.C., Washington, DC, for E.E.O.C., Amicus Curiae.\\nBefore GARZA, STEWART and OWEN, Circuit Judges.\\nPER CURIAM:\\nMargarita Duron brought this suit against Albertson\\'s LLC (Albertson\\'s) alleging discrimination on the basis of national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[1] The district court granted summary judgment for Albertson\\'s, concluding that Duron\\'s suit was untimely because she failed to rebut the presumption that she received a right-to-sue letter in the mail in due course. We vacate and remand to the district court for further proceedings.\\n\\nI\\nDuron filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) asserting that Albertson\\'s discriminated on the basis of her Hispanic national origin. Albertson\\'s subsequently terminated Duron. She then filed a second charge with the EEOC alleging that her termination was in retaliation for her earlier EEOC charge and that Albertson\\'s discriminated against her based on her national origin.\\nThe Louisiana Commission on Human Rights (LCHR) reviewed and dismissed Duron\\'s charge on September 24, 2004. Duron\\'s counsel then asked the EEOC to conduct a substantial weight review. The EEOC subsequently issued a \"Dismissal and Notice of Rights\" adopting the LCHR\\'s findings and advising Duron that she would have to file a lawsuit, if at all, within ninety days of receipt.\\nThe letter reflected October 4, 2004, as the \"Date Mailed\" and was addressed from the EEOC\\'s New Orleans District Office to Duron in Metairie, Louisiana. There is no evidence that the EEOC mailed a copy of the letter to Duron\\'s attorney. The letter reflects that a copy of the letter was sent to Lyol Brumby of Albertson\\'s employee-relations department. However, Albertson\\'s did not produce any evidence of receipt by Brumby or anyone else at Albertson\\'s.\\nIn a sworn affidavit, Duron denied receipt of this notice. She stated that she and her attorney made several calls to the EEOC to inquire as to the status of her case both prior to Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and in the first half of 2006\\x97 all without a response. On July 18, 2006, her attorney wrote a letter to the EEOC\\'s regional attorney and subsequently delivered a copy of that letter. The letter *290 indicates that Duron\\'s attorney had discussed her case with an EEOC official before and advised the EEOC that Duron wanted to pursue her rights in this case. Duron\\'s attorney also emailed that EEOC official. On August 24, 2006, Duron\\'s attorney received a copy of the EEOC right-to-sue letter dated October 4, 2004. In her affidavit, Duron stated that this was \"the first time I or my attorney had ever seen this right to sue letter.\" Her counsel represented to the court that he did not receive a copy of this letter until August 24, 2006.\\nDuron then filed this discrimination suit. Albertson\\'s moved for dismissal or, alternatively, summary judgment. The district court granted Albertson\\'s motion for summary judgment, holding, as a matter of law, that Duron\\'s affidavit was insufficient to rebut the presumption of receipt of the EEOC right-to-sue letter, thus rendering her lawsuit untimely. Further, the district court declined to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling.\\nDuron appealed, and the EEOC submitted an amicus curiae brief pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 29(a) supporting Duron\\'s contention that her affidavit was sufficient to raise a fact question.\\n\\nII\\nA plaintiff alleging employment discrimination must file a civil action no more than ninety days after she receives statutory notice of her right to sue from the EEOC.[2] The ninety-day window is \"strictly construed\"[3] and is \"a precondition to filing suit in district court.\"[4]\\nRelying on the presumption that government notices are mailed on the date stated in the notice and received within seven days thereafter, the district court found that Duron\\'s lawsuit was untimely. As stated by the Supreme Court, \"[t]he rule is well settled that proof that a letter properly directed was placed in a post office, creates a presumption that it reached its destination in usual time and was actually received by the person to whom it was addressed.\"[5]\\nIn Custer v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., we stated that \"[b]ecause th[e] mailbox rule functions merely to create a presumption of receipt, it only comes into play when there is a material question as to whether a document was actually received.\"[6] \"A threshold question for the application of the mailbox rule is whether there is sufficient evidence that the letter was actually mailed.\"[7] In that vein, this court opined that \"[a] sworn statement is credible evidence of mailing for the purposes *291 of the mailbox rule.\"[8] Further, we have recognized that \"[p]lacing letters in the mail may be proved by circumstantial evidence, including customary mailing practices used in the sender\\'s business.\"[9] On the other hand, \"[e]vidence of non-receipt can be used to establish that the notice was never mailed.\"[10]\\nAs in Custer, Albertson\\'s has not produced any business records or other physical evidence that the EEOC sent the notice of the right to sue. Albertson\\'s submitted no affidavits in support of the mailing. Additionally, Albertson\\'s has not produced any evidence that it received the copy of the notice the EEOC allegedly sent. Instead, the only evidence of mailing that Albertson\\'s provided was a copy of the EEOC notice of right to sue with \"10\/4\/04\" written in the \"Date Mailed\" field. In contrast, Duron provided a sworn affidavit that she did not receive the EEOC\\'s notice until August 2006, and she provided evidence that she and her attorney made several attempts to contact the EEOC to inquire as to the status of her case. Further, her attorney\\'s July 2006 letter indicated that Duron\\'s attorney had discussed her case with an EEOC official before and advised the EEOC that Duron wanted to pursue her rights in this case.\\nIn Alton v. Texas A&amp;M University, we stated that \"[w]here critical evidence is so weak or tenuous on an essential fact that it could not support a judgment in favor of the nonmovant, or where it is so overwhelming that it mandates judgment in favor of the movant, summary judgment is appropriate.\"[11] As in Custer, \"[o]n the issue of mailing, it cannot be said that either of Alton\\'s grounds are satisfied, and thus summary judgment is improper.\"[12]\\nIn closing, we note that if the EEOC had followed its former practice of sending right-to-sue letters by certified mail, this dispute would, in all likelihood, have never arisen.[13]\\n\\n* * *\\nFor the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, et seq.\\n[2]  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1); Baldwin County Welcome Ctr. v.

Should a state or local agency initiate an enforcement action, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(c) or \u00a7 2000e-5(d), the period for EEOC notification may be longer. Accordingly, a lack of diligence on the part of a claimant, e.g. failure to file a suit or contact the EEOC within 270 days of filing a charge with the EEOC (the 90-day period in addition to the 180-day period for action), may support a conclusion that an action is barred as untimely as a matter of law.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 64712}]"},{"id":73248,"date_filed":"1998-10-28","judges":null,"case_name_full":"Mendoza v.

She also appeals from a directed verdict on her Americans with\\n\\nDisabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claim and her Title VII sexual harassment claim. On appeal, she\\n\\x0ccontends that she introduced sufficient evidence at trial to support a jury verdict in her favor on\\n\\nher sexual harassment and disability discrimination claims, and presented sufficient evidence to\\n\\ngo to trial on her other claims. We affirm the district court summary judgment rulings and its\\n\\ngrant of a directed verdict on Mendoza\u2019s ADA claim, but reverse the directed verdict on her\\n\\nTitle VII sexual harassment claim.\\n\\n       Mendoza worked for Borden for a period of sixteen months. She started as a temporary\\n\\nemployee in 1993, but became a permanent employee in 1994. In April 1995, Mendoza was\\n\\nterminated. In April 1997, she filed this action against Borden, alleging that she was\\n\\nconstructively discharged as a result of Borden\u2019s discriminatory treatment of her. The district\\n\\ncourt granted Borden summary judgment on all of Mendoza\u2019s claims but two, permitting her\\n\\nsexual harassment and ADA claims to go to trial. At the conclusion of Mendoza\u2019s case-in-chief,\\n\\nthe district court, however, granted Borden\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. This appeal\\n\\nfollowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 I.\\n\\n            Summary Judgment on ADEA, Title VII Retaliation, and State Law Claims\\n\\n       Mendoza first argues that the district court erred in concluding that she had failed to\\n\\nmake out a prima facie case of age discrimination in violation of the ADEA. Mendoza\u2019s age\\n\\ndiscrimination claim, as alleged in her complaint, is that she was denied a promotion or raise\\n\\nbased on age, denied a modification in her work schedule, and subjected to disparate treatment\\n\\nbased on age. The district court, however, correctly found that Mendoza did not show that there\\n\\nwere promotions available while she was at Borden, and that there was nothing in the record \u2013\\n\\n\\n                                                 2\\n\\x0cother than a conclusory statement in her affidavit \u2013 to show that she was subject to age\\n\\ndiscrimination. Accordingly, because Mendoza failed to come forward with significant\\n\\nprobative evidence of age discrimination, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary\\n\\njudgment on this claim. See LaChance v. Duffy\u2019s Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th\\n\\nCir. 1998). We likewise affirm the grant of summary judgment to Borden on Mendoza\u2019s Title\\n\\nVII retaliation claim because in this claim as well Mendoza failed to come forward with\\n\\nsufficient probative evidence to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\\n\\n       Turning to the state law claims, Mendoza argues that the district court erred in granting\\n\\nsummary judgment to Borden on Mendoza\u2019s claim under the Florida Civil Rights Act. The\\n\\ndistrict court granted summary judgment on this claim because Mendoza failed to file a\\n\\ncomplaint with the Florida Commission on Human Relations. The law requires that this\\n\\nadministrative remedy be pursued before filing a civil action. See Blount v. Sterling Healthcare\\n\\nGroup, Inc., 934 F. Supp. 1365, 1369-70 (S.D. Fla. 1996) (collecting cases). Mendoza\u2019s\\n\\nargument that her filing of an EEOC charge was sufficient to satisfy any exhaustion requirement\\n\\nis unavailing. Under Florida law, Blount makes clear, no state law claim under the Florida Civil\\n\\nRights Act of 1992 may proceed until a complaint is filed with the FCHR. Because Mendoza\\n\\nfailed to do so, the district court correctly granted summary judgment to Borden on this claim.\\n\\n       Finally, Mendoza argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to\\n\\nBorden on her intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Under Florida law, this tort has\\n\\nfour elements: \u201c1) deliberate or reckless infliction of mental suffering; (2) by outrageous\\n\\nconduct; (3) which conduct must have caused the suffering; and (4) the suffering must have been\\n\\nsevere.\u201d Hart v. United States, 894 F.2d 1539, 1548 (11th Cir. 1990). As the district court\\n\\n\\n                                                 3\\n\\x0crecognized, Mendoza\u2019s allegations are not sufficient to meet this very demanding standard. See\\n\\nBlount, 934 F. Supp. at 1370-71 (finding that plaintiff had failed to show that she was subjected\\n\\nto relentless physical and verbal harassment). Accordingly, the district court did not err in\\n\\ngranting summary judgment to Borden on this claim.\\n\\n                                                  II.\\n\\n               Directed Verdict on ADA and Title VII Sexual Harassment Claims\\n\\n       We next turn to consider Mendoza\u2019s argument that the district court erred in granting a\\n\\ndirected verdict on her ADA claim. In order to prevail on this claim, Mendoza must establish\\n\\nthat she was an individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA. The ADA defines\\n\\n\u201cdisability\u201d as either \u201ca physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of\\n\\nthe major life activities of such individual,\u201d or \u201ca record of such an impairment,\u201d or \u201cbeing\\n\\nregarded as having such impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2).\\n\\n       The ADA regulations define \u201cmajor life activities\u201d to include \u201cfunctions such as caring\\n\\nfor oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning,\\n\\nand working.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(h)(2)(i). With regard to the major life activity of work, on\\n\\nwhich Mendoza relies, the regulations define the term \u201csubstantially limits\u201d to mean\\n\\n       significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad\\n       range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having\\n       comparable training, skills, and abilities. The inability to perform a single,\\n       particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity\\n       of working.\\n\\n\u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i). In applying this definition, the regulations tell us to consider the nature and\\n\\nseverity of the impairment; the duration or expected duration of the impairment and the\\n\\npermanent or long-term impact of the impairment. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(2).\\n\\n\\n                                                  4\\n\\x0c       We agree with the district court that Mendoza failed to introduce evidence that she was\\n\\nan individual with a disability under the ADA. Mendoza only introduced evidence showing that\\n\\nshe had an impairment that prevented her from lifting objects over five to seven pounds. She\\n\\n       has presented no evidence to show that she cannot perform a broad range or class\\n       of jobs; instead, she simply makes the vague assertion that she is unable to\\n       perform any job that [requires her to lift more than seven pounds]. . . . Although a\\n       plaintiff seeking recovery under the ADA is not required to provide a\\n       comprehensive list of jobs which she cannot perform, the person must provide\\n       some evidence beyond the mere existence and impact of a physical impairment . .\\n       ..\\n\\nSwain v. Hillsborough County School Bd., 146 F.3d 855, 858 (11th Cir. 1998). Because no\\n\\nreasonable jury could have concluded that Mendoza had a disability within the meaning of the\\n\\nADA, the district court correctly granted a directed verdict for Borden.\\n\\n       We reach a different result, however, on Mendoza\u2019s Title VII sexual harassment claim.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018When the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is\\n\\nsufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and creates an\\n\\nabusive working environment, Title VII is violated.\u2019\u201d Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs.,\\n\\nInc., 118 S. Ct. 998, 1001 (1998) (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993)).\\n\\n\u201cThis standard,\u201d the Supreme Court has told us, \u201ctakes a middle path between making actionable\\n\\nany conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological\\n\\ninjury. . . . [T]he very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it\\n\\ncreated a work environment abusive to employees . . . offends Title VII\u2019s broad rule of\\n\\nworkplace equality.\u201d Harris, 510 U.S. at 21-22.\\n\\n       The elements of a Title VII sexual harassment claim are the following: 1) the employee\\n\\nmust belong to a protected group; 2) the employee must have been subject to unwelcome sexual\\n\\n\\n                                                  5\\n\\x0charassment; 3) the harassment must have been based on sex; 4) the harassment must have been\\n\\nsufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment; and 5) there\\n\\nmust be a basis for holding the employer liable for the harassment either directly or indirectly.\\n\\nSee Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 903-05 (11th Cir. 1982). Whether an employee\\n\\ncan satisfy his or her burden of showing that the work environment is hostile or abusive is a fact-\\n\\nspecific question, requiring analysis of all the circumstances. Harris, 510 U.S. at 23.\\n\\n       To review the grant of a directed verdict, we must take all the evidence and reasonable\\n\\ninferences drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to Mendoza, the non-moving\\n\\nparty. A directed verdict is only proper where \u201c[t]he facts and inferences . . . \u2018so\\n\\noverwhelmingly favor the verdict\u2019 that no reasonable juror could reach a contrary decision.\u201d\\n\\nBivens Garden Office Bldg., Inc. v. Barnett Banks of Florida, Inc., 140 F.3d 898, 905 (11th Cir.\\n\\n1998) (quoting Hibiscus Assoc. v. Board of Trustees, 50 F.3d 908, 920 (11th Cir. 1995)). Thus,\\n\\nto affirm the directed verdict, Borden must show that no reasonable juror could have concluded\\n\\nthat the conduct complained of constituted actionable sexual harassment in violation of Title VII.\\n\\nOn this record, Borden has failed to make this showing.\\n\\n       Mendoza\u2019s testimony, essentially unrebutted, was that her supervisor, Dan Page \u2013 the\\n\\nhighest ranking executive at Borden\u2019s Miami facility \u2013 \u201cconstantly\u201d followed her around the\\n\\noffice and the hallways of the Borden\u2019s plant, staring at her and looking her up and down in a\\n\\nsexually suggestive manner. Mendoza also testified that, on two occasions, Page stared at her\\n\\ngroin area and made a sniffing sound, and another time, rubbed his hip against hers, while\\n\\ntouching her shoulder. Mendoza also asserts that Page made inappropriate comments, noting\\n\\nthat he once told her, \u201cI\u2019m getting fired up\u201d when she came into his office.\\n\\n\\n                                                  6\\n\\x0c       Borden argues that Mendoza\u2019s testimony was insufficient to establish her Title VII claim\\n\\nbecause Page\u2019s alleged conduct involved only sporadic and innocuous interractions with no\\n\\nsexual or otherwise gender-related abusive overtones. To determine whether Mendoza\u2019s\\n\\ntestimony is sufficient to support a jury verdict, all of Page\u2019s actions must be viewed together to\\n\\nassess whether a jury could conclude that his conduct created a hostile work environment. As\\n\\nwe have noted, \u201c[a] hostile environment claim is a single cause of action rather than a sum total\\n\\nof a number of mutually distinct causes of action to be judged each on its own merits,\u201d making it\\n\\nimproper to \u201cexamine each alleged incident of harassment in a vacuum.\u201d Vance v. Southern Bell\\n\\nTel. & Tel. Co., 863 F.2d 1503, 1510-11 (11th Cir. 1989) (holding that it was error for the\\n\\ndistrict court to require plaintiff to establish a claim as to each allegation of harassment).\\n\\n       Although we doubt that a simple assertion that a supervisor stared at or touched an\\n\\nemployee, without more, would support a claim of sexual harassment, such an allegation might\\n\\nbe sufficient when considered in conjunction with testimony concerning other acts alleged by the\\n\\nplaintiff. Physical contact, for example, can occur in many different contexts in the workplace.\\n\\nIt may be accidental, innocent, or actionable, depending on how it occurred or whether and what\\n\\nkind of other acts the plaintiff alleges as well as the social context of the particular workplace.\\n\\nAs Justice Scalia explained in Oncale, Title VII\u2019s objective standard\\n\\n       requires careful consideration of the social context in which particular behavior\\n       occurs and is experienced by its target. A professional football player\u2019s working\\n       environment is not severely or pervasively abusive, for example, even if the coach\\n       smacks him on the buttocks as he heads onto the field \u2013 even if the same behavior\\n       would reasonably be experienced as abusive by the coach\u2019s secretary (male or\\n       female) back at the office. The real social impact of workplace behavior often\\n       depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and\\n       relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used\\n       or the physical acts performed.\\n\\n\\n                                                   7\\n\\x0cOncale, 118 S. Ct. at 1003. To consider a supervisor\u2019s act of touching or excessively staring at\\n\\nan employee in isolation from the entire context of the workplace disserves Title VII\u2019s \u201cbroad\\n\\nrule of workplace equality,\u201d Harris, 510 U.S. at 22, making it likely that subtler forms of sex\\n\\ndiscrimination will go uncorrected. See Draper v. Coeur Rochester, Inc., 147 F.3d 1104, 1109\\n\\n(9th Cir. 1998) (\u201cDiscriminatory behavior comes in all shapes and sizes, and what might be an\\n\\ninnocuous occurrence in some circumstances may, in the context of a pattern of discriminatory\\n\\nharassment, take on an altogether different character, causing a worker to feel demeaned,\\n\\nhumiliated, or intimidated on account of her gender.\u201d).\\n\\n       We conclude that the totality of Mendoza\u2019s testimony was sufficient to survive Borden\u2019s\\n\\nmotion for a directed verdict. Mendoza\u2019s testimony that Page stared at her and looked her up\\n\\nand down all the time in a sexually suggestive manner is given context and substance by her\\n\\ntestimony concerning the two incidents in which she asserted that Page stared at her groin area\\n\\nwhile making a sniffing sound. Based on her account of the frequency and intensity of Page\u2019s\\n\\nunrelenting stares and looks, together with her allegations of his more egregious sexual conduct,\\n\\nwe cannot say that, as a matter of law, Page\u2019s conduct was insufficient to create a hostile work\\n\\nenvironment. Based on Mendoza\u2019s entire testimony, a jury could find that Page\u2019s conduct was\\n\\npervasive, unwelcome, and unreasonably interfered with Mendoza\u2019s work performance,\\n\\nsubjecting her to a sexually abusive work environment. See Vance, 863 F.2d at 1511 (\u201c\u2018[A]ll\\n\\nthat the victim of [sexual] harassment need show is that the alleged conduct constituted an\\n\\nunreasonably abusive or offensive work-related environment or adversely affected the\\n\\nreasonable employee\u2019s ability to do his or her job\u2019\u201d) (quoting Davis v. Monsanto Chemical Co.,\\n\\n858 F.2d 345, 349 (6th Cir. 1988)); see also Harris, 510 U.S. at 25 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (\u201cIt\\n\\n\\n                                                 8\\n\\x0csuffices to prove that a reasonable person subjected to the discriminatory conduct would find . . .\\n\\nthat the harassment so altered working conditions as to \u2018ma[k]e it more difficult to do the job.\u2019\u201d)\\n\\n(quoting Davis, 858 F.2d at 349). Further, a jury could conclude that Mendoza was subject to\\n\\nPage\u2019s stares and other conduct because of sex; \u201cbut for her sex, [Mendoza] would not have been\\n\\nsubjected to sexual harassment.\u201d Henson, 682 F.2d at 904. It may well be that, after trial, a jury\\n\\nwill conclude that Mendoza was not subject to sexual harassment that was sufficiently severe or\\n\\npervasive as to create a hostile work environment, but that is for the jury to determine. She has\\n\\npresented sufficient evidence to survive Borden\u2019s Rule 50(a) motion. See Allen v. Tyson Foods,\\n\\nInc., 121 F.3d 642, 647-48 (11th Cir. 1997); see also Gallagher v. Delaney, 139 F.3d 338, 347\\n\\n(2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cEvaluation of ambiguous acts such as those revealed by the potential evidence\\n\\nin this case presents an issue for the jury.\u201d).\\n\\n        The last issue we must consider is whether Mendoza has introduced sufficient evidence\\n\\nto hold Borden liable for Page\u2019s conduct. In Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 118 S. Ct. 2275\\n\\n(1998), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]n employer is subject to vicarious liability to a\\n\\nvictimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with\\n\\nimmediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee.\u201d Id. at 2292-93. There is no\\n\\nquestion here that Page was such a supervisor. However, the Court also permitted an employer\\n\\nto defend against a hostile work environment claim \u2013 one where no tangible employment action\\n\\nwas taken \u2013 by showing \u201c(a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct\\n\\npromptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably\\n\\nfailed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  9\\n\\x0cor to avoid harm otherwise.\u201d Id. at 2293. Thus, on remand, Borden will have the opportunity to\\n\\nestablish whether the affirmative defense outlined in Faragher would apply.\\n\\n       Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART AND\\n\\nREVERSED IN PART and the case is remanded to the district court for a new trial on\\n\\nMendoza\u2019s Title VII sexual harassment claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                               10\\n\\x0c', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 73248}]"},{"id":199405,"date_filed":"2001-05-16","judges":"Campbell, Coffin, Levin, Torruella","case_name_full":"George HAVERCOMBE, Plaintiff, Appellant, v.

For the reasons explained below, we affirm.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      Havercombe first sued these defendants on December 12, 1994, in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico alleging employment discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981.1 In that action (hereinafter Havercombe I), Havercombe alleged that from 1978 to 1997 he had been employed as a teacher and guidance counselor for the Puerto Rico Department of Education. Beginning in early 1990, according to Havercombe, defendants engaged in a course of discriminatory conduct, to wit, work place harassment and failure to promote him because of his race, national origin and age.2 On February 26, 1999, a jury found in Havercombe\\'s favor, awarding him $1,000,000 in damages. That award was reduced by the district court to $237,000 in April 1999.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      On May 3, 1999, less than a month after the district court entered final judgment in Havercombe I, Havercombe filed the current action in the same district court against the same defendants, once more alleging employment discrimination in violation of the ADEA and Title VII, but also alleging that the discrimination was in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981.3 The descriptive allegations in the complaint filed in the second action (hereinafter Havercombe II) were materially the same as those in Havercombe I.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      On May 31, 2000, the district court granted defendants\\' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim based on principles of res judicata. We review the district court\\'s action de novo. See Apparel Art Intern., Inc. v. Amertex Enterprises Ltd., 48 F.3d 576, 582 (1st Cir. 1995).\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Under the doctrine of res judicata, \"a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.\" Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980). Under the federal-law standard,4 this requires \"(1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier action; (2) an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and later suits; and (3) an identity of parties or privies in the two suits.\" Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of America, 924 F.2d 1161, 1166 (1st Cir. 1991). The parties do not dispute that prongs (1) and (3) are met here. Their disagreement revolves around prong (2).\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Defendant contends that the allegations of employment discrimination contained in the Havercombe II complaint are essentially identical to those that were litigated, or that could have been litigated, to a final judgment in Havercombe I. Both cases state causes of action against the same defendants under Title VII and the ADEA for race, national origin and age discrimination, and both complaints state that the alleged discrimination began in early 1990 and continued until the date of the complaint, viz, March 21, 1997 (Havercombe I) and May 3, 1999 (Havercombe II). To be sure, Havercombe II alleged that this same conduct went on for two more years than in Havercombe I. And Havercombe\\'s July 31, 1998 EEOC administrative complaint charging discrimination occurring in the period 1997-1998 forms part of Havercombe II but not Havercombe I. But nothing in particular -- no special incident different from what had already occurred in the past -- is identified as having taken place after 1997.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      Defendant argues that neither the addition of the &#167; 1981 claim nor the inclusion of the later EEOC administrative complaint (for conduct in 1997-1998) suffices to show that Havercombe II contains a cause of action that is distinct from the cause pleaded in Havercombe I. We agree.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      We start with the unsurprising proposition that, insofar as Havercombe II\\'s complaint alleges incidents of discrimination dating from 1990 to 1997 (the very same dates covered by the amended complaint in Havercombe I), Havercombe II is plainly precluded by the first lawsuit. Cloaking these same allegations in a new legal theory by adding a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981 cannot rescue Havercombe II from the judgment in Havercombe I for the period 1990 to 1997. As this court has said,\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      [a] single cause of action can manifest itself in an outpouring of different claims, based variously on federal statutes, state statutes, and the common law. ... [A]s long as the new complaint grows out of the same transaction or series of connected transactions as the old complaint, the causes of action are considered to be identical for res judicata purposes.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      Kale, 924 F.2d at 1166 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Section 1981, which forbids discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts, see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981, is another way of presenting the same race discrimination plaintiff suffered (and for which the jury in Havercombe I found defendants liable) in the context of a different legal theory. Having brought and prevailed upon his Title VII claim in Havercombe I, in which he alleged racial discrimination of the type that would be covered by &#167; 1981, such as failure to promote, plaintiff cannot now go forward with another lawsuit based on the same underlying facts but premised on a different, and in this case narrower, federal anti-discrimination statute. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 179-80 (1989) (distinguishing section 1981 from Title VII and calling the latter the one with \"the more expansive reach mak[ing] it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\" whereas section 1981 \"covers only conduct at the initial formation of the [employment] contract and conduct which impairs the right to enforce [employment] contract obligations through legal process\"). Plaintiff\\'s &#167; 1981 claim, in so far as it is based on incidents of race discrimination between 1990 and 1997, could have been brought in Havercombe I but was not. As such, it is res judicata by virtue of the final judgment in Havercombe I. As the district court correctly held, \"[t]he addition of the Section 1981 claim does not breath life into this action.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      The harder question is whether the alleged subsequent discrimination that continued from 1997 until 1999 (partially covered by a later EEOC administrative complaint filed in 1998) can properly be considered to be part of the same transaction or series of connected transactions adjudicated to a final judgment in Havercombe I. The verdict in Havercombe I was returned on February 26, 1999, and a final judgment was entered in April 1999 after defendant\\'s motion for remittitur was granted. The trial in Havercombe I, however, encompassed only alleged discriminatory conduct during the period 1990-1997.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      To decide this question we look first at this circuit\\'s approach to res judicata, which follows the Restatement (Second) of Judgments. See Manego v. Orleans Board of Trade, 773 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1985) cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1084, (1986) (adopting the \"transactional\" definition of res judicata of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 24). Section 24 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgment provides:\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      (1) When a valid and final judgment rendered in an action extinguishes the plaintiff\\'s claim pursuant to the rules of merger or bar ..., the claim extinguished includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      (2) What factual grouping constitutes a \"transaction\", and what groupings constitute a \"series\", are to be determined pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties\\' expectations or business understanding or usage.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 24 (emphasis added). The Restatement explains this pragmatic approach as an outgrowth of the federal rules\\' \"considerable freedom of amendment and [the system\\'s] willing[ness] to tolerate changes of direction in the course of litigation.\" Id., cmt. a. Applying the Restatement considerations to this case\\'s factual and procedural posture, we conclude that Havercombe I extinguished not only the claims for the period 1990-1997 alleged in Havercombe II but those continuing through 1999 as well.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      In so deciding, we look first to the amended complaint in Havercombe II on which the plaintiff relies in order to distinguish this second action from the first. The Havercombe II complaint alleges that \"Defendant have [sic] subjected plaintiff to a discriminatory and offensive environment in the workplace, which has entailed, inter alia, offensive racial slurs, denial of lunch privileges, assignment to unhealthy and hazardous working areas and unfair adverse recommendations.\" The complaint further alleges that \"[t]he racial discrimination practices by defendant Victor Fajardo in refusing to . . . promote plaintiff and in issuing adverse assignment decisions has [sic] deprived plaintiff of the equal benefit of the law . . . \" and that \"Defendants have engaged in discriminatory practices against plaintiff regarding the terms and conditions of his employment on the basis of age, including but not limited to engaging in a pattern and practice of harassment and humiliation. . . .\"\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      The wording of the allegations contained in the Havercombe II complaint is materially identical to that in the Havercombe I amended complaint (except for the mention of an additional cause of action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981, supra).5 The dates alleged in Havercombe II as the beginning of the defendants\\' discriminatory acts are 1990 and 1991, as they were in Havercombe I. We note also that Havercombe initially cited in Havercombe II his first EEOC right-to-sue letter (September 16, 1994) on which he based Havercombe I. By amendment, however, he replaced this reference with a later EEOC letter covering allegations of discrimination in 1997-1998 after defendants pointed to a statute of limitations problem should the second action be based on the earlier date.6\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Plaintiff does not specifically allege in his amended Havercombe II complaint that any new facts occurred after 1997 indicative of additional causes of action under Title VII and the ADEA distinct from those pleaded and adjudicated in Havercombe I. On the contrary, the language in the Havercombe II complaint is general and broad, covering the period commencing in 1990-91, and indicating that all acts within that entire period, including those after 1997, were part of the same pattern of discrimination - a pattern previously alleged in Havercombe I. No new and distinctive incidents of discrimination were alleged in Havercombe II.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      Although Havercombe\\'s 1998 EEOC administrative complaint, filed with the district court in support of his complaint in Havercombe II, charges discriminatory conduct during 1997-98 - after the period covered by the Havercombe I amended complaint - these charges simply repeat similar broadly-worded charges made in Havercombe\\'s earlier EEOC complaints and in Havercombe I itself.7 No identifying dates or otherwise specific incidents are set out. In the 1998 EEOC complaint, Havercombe reasserts earlier allegations that he was denied leave time granted to other employees and was placed in inadequate and unsanitary work spaces. These broadly-described charges do not identify transactions that are sufficiently separate from the earlier ones to constitute a new cause of action arising in the 1997-1999 period even if the allegations are generously read to cover occurrences extending into that period.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      Key in both cases was the employment relationship between Havercombe and the defendants and the propriety of the defendants\\' motivation for adverse employment decisions that Havercombe alleges he endured. Spread out over a long period of time, from 1990 to 1999, all of these acts were allegedly committed because of racial and age-related animus. It is, in fact, Havercombe\\'s contention that all of these events were directly related to each other in terms of motivation and common purpose, one factor the Restatement instructs us to consider when defining \"transaction\" or \"series of connected transactions.\" See Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 24(2). See also King v. Union Oil Co. of California, 117 F.3d 443, 446-47 (10th Cir. 1997) (holding that employer\\'s decision to terminate employee and its later decision to refuse to pay severance benefits are part of a series of connected transactions because they were both alleged to be based on improper racial and age-related animus, thus giving rise to only one cause of action, even though the factual events giving rise to each are separate and the first action provided the basis for the latter).\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      A further pervasive allegation in both Havercombe I and Havercombe II is that of a hostile work environment. Such a claim does not ordinarily turn on single acts but on an aggregation of hostile acts extending over a period of time. See O\\'Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 732 (1st Cir. 2001) (stating that \"a plaintiff usually will not have a viable claim of hostile work environment from single acts that are isolated or sporadic or not themselves severe enough to alter the work environment and create an abusive work environment\"). Incidents occurring in 1997-1999 would have been additional evidence in Havercombe I of the unlawful workplace environment; they would have easily fit the \"litigative unit\" of the first trial. Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 24, cmt. a. Havercombe\\'s allegations in his July 31, 1998 EEOC complaint -- allegations such as the continual humiliation he suffered \"on a day by [day] basis in all forms,\" and his sub-standard work conditions -- would have all been examples of, and could have been used to prove, the pattern of discrimination Havercombe alleged he suffered and that the jury apparently found to be true in Havercombe I. The additional incidents during that period could also have been the subject of the testimony and other factual proffers in Havercombe I as, among other things, proof of the defendant\\'s on-going practice of unlawful discrimination. Such an overlap in evidentiary proffers is, according to the Restatement, another good reason for the \"second action [to] be held precluded.\" Id., cmt. b.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      We recognize that violations of the type here alleged are sometimes considered to be \"serial\" (nomenclature rather similar to the Restatement\\'s \"series of transactions\" language). Serial violations may be \"composed of a number of discriminatory acts emanating from the same discriminatory animus, each act constituting a separate wrong actionable under Title VII,\" Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 522 (1st Cir. 1990) (emphasis added). But the Havercombe II pleadings are insufficient to indicate that a separate actionable wrong occurred during the 1997-1999 period.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      As we have noted, Havercombe\\'s pleadings do little to identify discrete, separable wrongs. Rather, they suggest a claim of a pattern and practice of improper acts adding up to a single claim of workplace harassment. See O\\'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 732. The serial violations doctrine was developed as an equitable exception to otherwise strict statute of limitations requirements for civil rights claims. Often times (and for the reasons explained in O\\'Rourke, see id.), a plaintiff does not know that, for several years on a continuous basis, she has been the victim of unlawful discrimination until after she missed the filing deadline. The concerns that animate the serial violations doctrine do not apply in the present situation pertaining to res judicata. Havercombe does not contend that he is the victim of discrete acts of discrimination, each actionable under Title VII or the ADEA. On the contrary, he alleges both in Havercombe I and Havercombe II that he has been harassed and subject to on-going humiliation on the basis of his race and age while at work.8 He also does not contend that during and immediately before the Havercombe I trial in 1999 he lacked knowledge of any incidents that occurred in 1997 and 1998. Rather, six months before the jury began deliberating in Havercombe I, he filed a claim with the EEOC alleging discrimination based on, among other things, such additional incidents.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      Had Havercombe amended his complaint in late 1998 to include these incidents, they might have increased his eventual damages award. In fact, while stating that these incidents are more of the same of the on-going harassment he suffered, which did not stop with the filing of his first lawsuit, Havercombe acknowledges that his \"objective [in bringing Havercombe II] is to receive adequate economic compensation for damages.\" By this, Havercombe suggests that instead of bringing a new cause of action, he is asking to be further reimbursed over and above the jury award he already received for suffering constant and on-going harassment. Had he wished to augment his damages award, he should have (and could have) provided more evidence of harassment during the trial of Havercombe I in 1999, including the harassment he now alleges was on-going throughout that earlier proceeding.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      Havercombe contends that his allegations of discrimination between 1997 and 1999 could not have been brought, by amendment or otherwise, in Havercombe I because not until February 8, 1999 -- shortly before the trial began and only three weeks before the jury verdict in Havercombe I -- did he receive from the EEOC a right-to-sue letter based on the later conduct. Assuming that Havercombe needed a new EEOC letter in these circumstances -- a matter we need not decide -- the lack of a right-to-sue letter would not have prevented plaintiff from notifying the court of his allegations of defendants\\' continuing violations of federal anti-discrimination laws (against which the defendants were at that time engaged in defending) and, if need be, asking for a stay until the EEOC issued him the letter. See Hermann v. Cencom Cable Assoc. Inc., 999 F.2d 223, 225 (7th Cir. 1993). At the same time, the plaintiff could have requested of the EEOC an acceleration of the administrative process. See id. And when, several weeks before trial, plaintiff did receive the right-to-sue letter, plaintiff could have moved to amend his original complaint to include those allegations in order to put them before the jury and argue for higher damages. See Boateng v. Interamerican University, Inc., 219 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir. 2000); Hermann, 999 F.2d at 225. Given the similarity of the alleged discrimination during 1997-1999 with that allegedly occurring in the early 1990s (at least as the conduct is described in the two complaints), and given that the general rule in the federal courts is to liberally permit amendments where justice so requires, his failure to so amend has foreclosed him from bringing them at all. See Boateng, 219 F.3d at 62 (agreeing with other circuits that have held that Title VII claims are precluded by a prior adjudication even though a right-to-sue letter had not been obtained until after final judgment had entered in first action and concluding that \"there is no principled basis for reaching a different result where, as here, the plaintiff obtained permission to sue from the EEOC while his first suit was still pending\"). Thus, we find the plaintiff\\'s objections relating to timing of the February 8, 1999 EEOC right-to-sue letter are unavailing.9\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      This would be a different case had the complaint in Havercombe II been pleaded so as to set out fresh causes of action in the post-1997 period. However, we think it was plaintiff\\'s burden to make allegations from which the existence of a new cause of action could be gleaned. The choice of language and structure of his second complaint was his to make. See, e.g., Burnett v. Grattan, 468 U.S. 42, 50-51 n.13 (1984) (stating that an injured person \"must look ahead to the responsibilities that immediately follow filing of a complaint [and] be prepared to withstand various responses, such as a motion to dismiss,\" and noting that \"[a]lthough the pleading and amendment of pleadings rules in federal court are to be liberally construed, the administration of justice is not well served by the filing of premature, hastily drawn complaints\").\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      The rule is well-established, of course, that we must take as true all well-pleaded facts and draw all reasonable inferences favorable to the complainant. See Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 283 (1986); Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1990). But even under this forgiving standard, Havercombe\\'s complaint does not survive scrutiny. Alerted to the possibility that Havercombe was trying to relitigate claims already adjudicated in his favor by the similarities between the complaint in Havercombe II and the complaint in Havercombe I, see supra note 5 and accompanying text, we looked further to the summary of the evidence presented during the Havercombe I trial (as provided by the district court\\'s Memorandum and Opinion denying defendant\\'s motion for judgment as a matter of law). When comparing this summary to the universe of reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the factual allegations contained in the Havercombe II complaint, we cannot conclude that Havercombe II covers any new ground. There are no factual allegations that can be reasonably drawn from the complaint in Havercombe II from which the district court could conclude that the claims therein give rise to a different \"transaction\" or \"series of transactions\" than those litigated to a jury verdict in Havercombe I. See, e.g., Isaac v. Schwartz, 706 F.2d 15, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1983) (affirming a judgment of dismissal on the basis of res judicata after determining that the \"new complaint grows out of the same \\'transaction or series of connected transactions\\' as the old complaint\").\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      As a last-ditch effort, plaintiff claims that the equitable exception to the res judicata doctrine should apply here, i.e., that equity demands the suspension of the doctrine in this case. The Supreme Court has, however, counseled us to adhere to traditional principles of res judicata and not to make any \"ad hoc determination of the equities in a particular case.\" Federated Dep\\'t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401 (1981). See also Johnson v. SCA Disposal Servs., Inc., 931 F.2d 970, 977 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing Moitie for the proposition that \"we cannot relax the principles of claim preclusion even if we find that the equities cry out for us to do so\"). In this case, Havercombe has already won a jury verdict in his favor, albeit receiving a remitted award. Had he been suffering on-going discrimination of the type he was in the process of actively litigating during the pendency of the first trial, he has only himself to blame for not bringing it to the court\\'s attention and amending his complaint accordingly. The trial commenced on February 9, 1999, a time by which all of the discrimination alleged in Havercombe II had occurred.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      Because we affirm the district court\\'s dismissal of plaintiff\\'s complaint on the basis of res judicata, we do not reach the other bases for dismissal raised by defendants in their appeal.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      Affirmed.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      So ordered. Costs to appellants.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        Notes:\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         The procedural history of this litigation makes case-counting somewhat complicated. In 1995, Havercombe filed yet another lawsuit against the same defendants alleging only age discrimination under the ADEA. That case was consolidated with his 1994 case on October 4, 1995. On March 21, 1997, Havercombe moved to amend his complaint, dropping the &#167; 1981 claim. It was on that amended complaint that Havercombe went to trial and won a jury verdict in his favor.\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         George Havercombe describes himself as black, as being in his mid-sixties, and as having been born in Antigua.\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         As noted above, see supra note 1, Havercombe\\'s initial complaint alleged a violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981, but that count was abandoned before trial.\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         Because the judgment in the first action was rendered by a federal court, the preclusive effect of that judgment in the instant action is governed by federal res judicata principles. See Johnson v. SCA Disposal Servs., Inc., 931 F.2d 970, 974 (1st Cir. 1991).\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         As an example, paragraph 22 of the amended complaint filed in Havercombe I, alleges that \"Defendants have subjected plaintiff to a discriminatory and offensive environment in the workplace, which has entailed, inter alia, offensive racial slurs, denial of lunch privileges, assignment to unhealthy and hazardous working areas and unfair adverse recommendations....\" Exactly the same language appears in paragraph 12 of the complaint in Havercombe II.\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         On January 14, 2000, eight months after initially filing suit in Havercombe II, plaintiff moved to amend his complaint to replace the date of September 16, 1994 with the date of February 8, 1999, the date on which he received the second EEOC right-to-sue letter on which he bases Havercombe II.\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         Even though the allegations contained in the July 31, 1998 EEOC administrative complaint were not specifically imported into the Havercombe II complaint, we will include them in our analysis, assuming, without deciding, that they are matters that may fairly be incorporated into the complaint. See Beddal v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1998).\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         Although in both cases Havercombe mentions the defendants\\' alleged failure to promote him, in Havercombe II, plaintiff fails to specify a date or time of that alleged harm, and therefore we have no basis on which to reasonably determine whether this is a fresh act of discrimination, not alleged and proved in Havercombe I, or a repetition of prior claims already adjudicated. Here, where Havercombe gives no details of this asserted slight, we have no basis for viewing it as other than previously adjudicated.\\n      \\n      \\n        9\\n         For the same reasons, this case does not fall into the \"exceptions to the general rule concerning claim-splitting\" as provided by the Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 26. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 26, cmt. c (\"where formal barriers existed against full presentation of claim in first action\" such as where subject matter jurisdiction is limited in the court of the first action); id., cmt. j (where the defendant has committed fraud on the plaintiff by concealing evidence \"of a part or phase of claim that the plaintiff failed to include in an earlier action.\").

State of Rhode Island, 749 F.3d 934, 940 (1st Cir. 1985)(stating that if the information on which the second action is based was not reasonably discoverable during the pendency of the first action, res judicata will not apply).\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 199405}]"},{"id":2685577,"date_filed":"2014-07-24","judges":"Kleinfeld, Nguyen, Watford","case_name_full":"Mark JOHNSON; Franco S.

Bryant (collectively,\\n\\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor\\n\\nof the City and County of San Francisco, Civil Service Commission of San\\n\\nFrancisco, San Francisco Fire Department, and San Francisco Fire Commission\\n\\n(collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d).\\n\\n      We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm in part and\\n\\nreverse and remand in part.\\n\\n      1. Plaintiffs did not offer any argument or evidence to challenge the district\\n\\ncourt\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants with respect to\\n\\ntheir claims for: (a) violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Counts 2, 6, and 10); (b)\\n\\nunlawful retaliation based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983; Title VII of the Civil\\n\\nRights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d); and the California Fair Employment and Housing\\n\\nAct (\u201cFEHA\u201d), Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12940, et seq. (Counts 9 through 12); and (c)\\n\\nfailure to prevent discrimination in violation of \u00a7 1981, \u00a7 1983, Title VII, and\\n\\nFEHA (Counts 5 through 8). Accordingly, Plaintiffs have waived these issues, and\\n\\nthe only remaining causes of action at issue are the race discrimination claims in\\n\\nviolation of \u00a7 1981, Title VII, and FEHA (Counts 1, 3, and 4, respectively). See\\n\\nTri-Valley CAREs v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, 671 F.3d 1113, 1130 (9th Cir. 2012)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          2\\n\\x0c(\u201cClaims not made in an opening brief in a sufficient manner to put the opposing\\n\\nparty on notice are deemed waived.\u201d).\\n\\n      2. The district court properly determined that some of Plaintiffs\u2019 Title VII\\n\\nclaims were untimely. In 2008 and 2009, Plaintiffs filed their initial discrimination\\n\\ncharge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). In\\n\\nDecember 2008, January 2009, and February 2009, the EEOC issued Plaintiffs\\n\\nright-to-sue notices, which instructed them that should they choose to bring a civil\\n\\naction, such action must be filed within 90 days of their receipt of their notice. See\\n\\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). Plaintiffs commenced the instant action in November\\n\\n2009, well after the prescribed 90-day period. Consequently, the district court\\n\\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction over, and properly disposed of, the claims\\n\\nadvanced in Plaintiffs\u2019 2008 and 2009 EEOC charges. Vasquez v. County of Los\\n\\nAngeles, 349 F.3d 634, 644 (9th Cir. 2003).\\n\\n      However, the district court erred in dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 amended Title VII\\n\\nclaims as similarly untimely. Plaintiffs filed a second round of charges with the\\n\\nEEOC in June 2010, and received authorization to sue in July 2010. Plaintiffs then\\n\\namended the complaint to supplement their original allegations. Although the\\n\\ndistrict court characterized the second charges to the EEOC as identical to the first,\\n\\nthe second charges included the use of the challenged employment practice on\\n\\n\\n                                          3\\n\\x0csubsequent occasions. See generally Lewis v. City of Chicago, 560 U.S. 205,\\n\\n213\u201316 (2010). On the charge filed by Plaintiff Calzolai, for example, he\\n\\ncategorized the matter as a \u201cContinuing Action\u201d and noted that the latest instance\\n\\nof alleged discrimination occurred in September 2009. Indeed, it appears from the\\n\\nrecord that the challenged policies and practices remained in place through 2009,\\n\\n2010, and 2011, and were used periodically to promote certain candidates in each\\n\\nof those years. Under the circumstances, imposing the administrative exhaustion\\n\\nrules to require Plaintiffs to re-file suit is unnecessary and would run counter to the\\n\\npurposes of administrative exhaustion in the first place. See B.K.B. v. Maui Police\\n\\nDep\u2019t, 276 F.3d 1091, 1099 (9th Cir. 2002). Therefore, the district court erred to\\n\\nthe extent it purported to dispose of alleged violations that occurred after 2009.\\n\\n      3. The district court also erred in its analysis of Plaintiffs\u2019 Title VII, FEHA,\\n\\nand \u00a7 1981 disparate impact claims. \u201cA plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of\\n\\ndisparate impact by showing a significant disparate impact on a protected class\\n\\ncaused by a specific, identified, employment practice or selection criterion.\u201d Stout\\n\\nv. Potter, 276 F.3d 1118, 1121 (9th Cir. 2002). Plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that\\n\\nDefendants promoted candidates based on their rank-ordered examination scores.\\n\\nThe district court rejected that theory as lacking evidentiary support, and instead\\n\\naccepted Defendants\u2019 position that because all candidates within the 74-point\\n\\n\\n                                           4\\n\\x0c\u201cstatistically valid group\u201d were eligible for promotion, actual promotions were\\n\\nirrelevant. The evidence in the record, however, creates at least a triable issue of\\n\\nfact as to whether the Chief actually promoted candidates based on their rank-\\n\\nordered examination scores, without regard to the grouping procedure. Further, the\\n\\ndistrict court\u2019s observation that disparate impact claims attack unequal\\n\\nopportunity\u2014that is, disparity in eligibility for promotion, not disparity in actual\\n\\npromotions\u2014while true, does not preclude Plaintiffs from arguing that rank-order\\n\\nwas the Department\u2019s actual eligibility criteria based on the record of actual\\n\\npromotions. We therefore reverse and remand to the district court to determine,\\n\\namong other things, whether a statistically significant disparity resulted from the\\n\\neligibility criteria challenged by Plaintiffs. See Contreras v. City of Los Angeles,\\n\\n656 F.2d 1267, 1272\u201374 (9th Cir. 1981).\\n\\n      4. The district court properly granted summary judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019\\n\\ndisparate treatment claims, because they failed to establish a prima facie case by\\n\\noffering \u201cevidence that gives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.\u201d\\n\\nVasquez, 349 F.3d at 640. It is undisputed that those responsible for scoring the\\n\\nexam had no information about any candidate\u2019s identity or race. Nor is it disputed\\n\\nthat among those who have allegedly received unearned points were African\\n\\nAmericans, including three among the top thirteen candidates in the eligibility list.\\n\\n\\n                                          5\\n\\x0cAccordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 disparate treatment claims under Title VII, FEHA, and \u00a7\\n\\n1981 lack merit. See Fonseca v. Sysco Food Servs. of Arizona, Inc., 374 F.3d 840,\\n\\n850 (9th Cir. 2004) (\u201cAnalysis of an employment discrimination claim under \u00a7\\n\\n1981 follows the same legal principles as those applicable in a Title VII disparate\\n\\ntreatment case.\u201d).\\n\\n      The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\\n\\n      AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED and REMANDED in part.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         6\\n\\x0c', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 2685577}]"},{"id":111365,"date_filed":"1985-04-22","judges":"Blackmun, Brennan, Burger, Connor, Marshall, O'Connor, Powell, Rehnquist, Stevens, White","case_name_full":"Marrese Et Al. v.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, held as a matter of federal law that the earlier state court judgments barred the federal antitrust suit. 726 F. 2d 1150 (1984). Under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1738, a federal court generally is required to consider first the law of the State in which the judgment was rendered to determine its preclusive effect. Because the lower courts did not consider state preclusion law in this case, we reverse and remand.\\nI \u2014 I\\nPetitioners are board-certified orthopaedic surgeons who applied for membership in respondent American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (Academy). Respondent denied the membership applications without providing a hearing or a statement of reasons. In November 1976, petitioner Dr. Treister filed suit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, State of Illinois, alleging that the denial of membership in the Academy violated associational rights protected by Illinois common law. Petitioner Dr. Marrese separately filed a similar action in state court. Neither petitioner alleged a violation of state antitrust law in his state court action; nor did either petitioner contemporaneously file a federal antitrust suit. The Illinois Appellate Court ultimately held that Dr. Treister\u2019s complaint failed to state a cause of action, Treister v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 78 Ill. App. 3d 746, 396 N. E. 2d 1225 (1979), and the Illinois Supreme Court denied leave to appeal. 79 Ill. 2d 630 (1980). After the Appellate Court ruled against Dr. Treister, the Circuit Court dismissed Dr. Marrese\u2019s complaint.\\n*376In March 1980, petitioners filed a federal antitrust suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois based on the same events underlying their unsuccessful state court actions. As amended, the complaint alleged that respondent Academy possesses monopoly power, that petitioners were denied membership in order to discourage competition, and that their exclusion constituted a boycott in violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1. App. 8, 26-30, 33. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss arguing that claim preclusion barred the federal antitrust claim because the earlier state court actions concerned the same facts and were dismissed with prejudice.1 In denying this motion, the District Court reasoned that state courts lack jurisdiction over federal antitrust claims, and therefore a state court judgment cannot have claim preclusive effect in a subsequent federal antitrust suit. 496 F. Supp. 236, 238-239 (1980), on reconsideration, 524 F. Supp. 389 (1981). Discovery began and respondent refused to allow petitioners access to certain files relating to membership applications. After respondent persisted in this refusal despite a discovery order, the District Court held respondent in criminal contempt. App. to Pet. for Cert. N-l.\\nThe judgment of contempt was reversed by a divided panel of the Court of Appeals in an opinion holding that the District Judge had abused his discretion by authorizing discovery of the membership files and also suggesting that the federal action was barred by claim preclusion and that the antitrust claims were groundless. 692 F. 2d 1083 (1982). This opinion was vacated by an en banc vote, and the original panel issued a narrower opinion that did not discuss claim pre-*377elusion. 706 F. 2d 1488 (1983). The Court of Appeals then vacated the second opinion and ordered rehearing en banc. In a divided vote, the Court of Appeals held that claim preclusion barred the federal antitrust suit and reversed the contempt order because the discovery order was invalid. 726 F. 2d 1150 (1984).\\nOn the claim preclusion issue, no opinion commanded the votes of a majority of the Court of Appeals. A plurality opinion concluded that a state court judgment bars the subsequent filing of a federal antitrust claim if the plaintiff could have brought a state antitrust claim under a state statute \u201cmaterially identical\u201d to the Sherman Act. Id., at 1153. The plurality examined the Illinois Antitrust Act, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, \u00b6 60-3(2) (1981), and found that it is sufficiently similar to the Sherman Act to bar petitioners\u2019 federal antitrust claims in the instant case. Id., at 1155-1156. An opinion concurring in part concluded that res judicata required petitioners to bring their \u201centire cause of action within a reasonable period of time.\u201d Id., at 1166 (Flaum, J.). To avoid preclusion of their federal antitrust claim, petitioners should have either filed concurrent state and federal actions or brought their state claims in federal court pendent to their Sherman Act claim. Ibid.\\nFive judges also concluded that the discovery order was invalid and therefore the contempt judgment should be reversed. A plurality opinion first observed that the discovery order was invalid because the District Court should have dismissed the suit on claim preclusion grounds before the discovery order was entered. Id., at 1158. Alternatively, the order constituted an abuse of discretion because it did not adequately prevent petitioners from misusing the discovery process. Id., at 1158-1162. Three judges joined the entire discussion concerning the discovery order. A fourth judge did not believe that claim preclusion applied, but he agreed that the discovery order constituted an abuse of discretion. Id., at 1162 (Eschbach, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Finally, the fifth judge observed that it was suffi*378cient to hold that the complaint should have been dismissed on claim preclusion grounds; he added, however, that if he thought it necessary he would join the portion of the plurality opinion holding the discovery order invalid. Id., at 1162 (Bauer, J., concurring).\\nWe granted certiorari limited to the question whether the Court of Appeals correctly held that claim preclusion requires dismissal of the federal antitrust action, 467 U. S. 1258 (1984), and we now reverse.\\nBefore addressing the merits of the decision below, we first examine whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss. Although the parties did not raise the jurisdictional issue before this Court, we address it to assure that the claim preclusion issue is properly before us. See, e. g., United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U. S. 192, 197 (1956). In the present case, the District Court initially refused to certify its denial of the motion to dismiss for immediate appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1292(b). The District Court subsequently held respondent in criminal contempt for refusing to comply with a discovery order. Respondent then appealed from the judgment of criminal contempt pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1291. See Bray v. United States, 423 U. S. 73 (1975) (per curiam). While the appeal from the contempt judgment was pending, the District Court amended the earlier denial of the motion to dismiss in order to certify it for immediate appeal. App. to Pet. for Cert. 1-1. The Court of Appeals authorized interlocutory appeal pursuant to \u00a7 1292(b), and ordered proceedings consolidated with the appeal from the contempt order. 726 F. 2d, at 1152; App. to Pet. for Cert. J-1.\\nPetitioners argued below that because the appeal from the contempt order was pending, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to amend its order denying the motion to dismiss to *379allow interlocutory appeal. In general, filing of a notice of appeal confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal. Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 58 (1982) (per curiam). This proposition, however, does not imply that an appeal from a judgment of criminal contempt based on noncompliance with a discovery order transfers jurisdiction over the entire case to the court of appeals. Criminal contempt judgments are immediately appealable pursuant to \u00a7 1291 because they result from \u201c \u2018a separate and independent proceeding ... to vindicate the authority of the court\u2019 \u201d and are \u201c \u2018not a part of the original cause.\u2019\u201d Bray, supra, at 75, quoting Gompers v. Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 445, 451 (1911). Thus, prior to certification of the claim preclusion issue pursuant to \u00a7 1292(b), the contempt judgment was the only matter before the Court of Appeals. See 706 F. 2d, at 1497-1498; 692 F. 2d, at 1096. The District Court\u2019s amendment of its initial denial of the motion to dismiss did not interfere with but instead facilitated review of the pending appeal from the contempt order. We agree with the Court of Appeals, 726 F. 2d, at 1152, that the pendency of the appeal from the contempt judgment did not prevent the District Court from certifying the denial of the motion to dismiss for immediate appeal under \u00a7 1292(b). Accordingly, the Court of Appeals properly exercised jurisdiction over the consolidated appeals, and we have jurisdiction to review that court\u2019s decision with respect to dismissal of the antitrust claim.\\nHH HH\\nThe issue presented by this case is whether a state court judgment may have preclusive effect on a federal antitrust claim that could not have been raised in the state proceeding. Although federal antitrust claims are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts, see, e. g., General Investment *380Co. v. Lake Shore &amp; M. S. R. Co., 260 U. S. 261, 286-288 (1922), the Court of Appeals ruled that the dismissal of petitioners\u2019 complaints in state court barred them from bringing a claim based on the same facts under the Sherman Act. The Court of Appeals erred by suggesting that in these circumstances a federal court should determine the preclusive effect of a state court judgment without regard to the law of the State in which judgment was rendered.\\nThe preclusive effect of a state court judgment in a subsequent federal lawsuit generally is determined by the full faith and credit statute, which provides that state judicial proceedings \u201cshall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States ... as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State . . . from which they are taken.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1738. This statute directs a federal court to refer to the preclusion law of the State in which judgment was rendered. \u201cIt has long been established that \u00a7 1738 does not allow federal courts to employ their own rules of res judicata in determining the effect of state judgments. Rather, it goes beyond the common law and commands a federal court to accept the rules chosen by the State from which the judgment is taken.\u201d Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 481-482 (1982); see also Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 96 (1980). Section 1738 embodies concerns of comity and federalism that allow the States to determine, subject to the requirements of the statute and the Due Process Clause, the preclusive effect of judgments in their own courts. See Kremer, supra, at 478, 481-483. Cf. Riley v. New York Trust Co., 315 U. S. 343, 349 (1942) (discussing preclusive effect of state judgment in proceedings in another State).\\nThe fact that petitioners\u2019 antitrust claim is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts does not necessarily make \u00a7 1738 inapplicable to this case. Our decisions indicate that a state court judgment may in some circumstances have preclusive effect in a subsequent action within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. Without discussing \u00a7 1738, *381this Court has held that the issue preclusive effect of a state court judgment barred a subsequent patent suit that could not have been brought in state court. Becker v. Contoure Laboratories, Inc., 279 U. S. 388 (1929). Moreover, Kremer held that \u00a7 1738 applies to a claim of employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e et seq., although the Court expressly declined to decide whether Title VII claims can be brought only in federal courts. 456 U. S., at 479, n. 20. Kremer implies that absent an exception to \u00a7 1738, state law determines at least the issue preclusive effect of a prior state judgment in a subsequent action involving a claim within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.\\nMore generally, Kremer indicates that \u00a7 1738 requires a federal court to look first to state preclusion law in determining the preclusive effects of a state court judgment. Cf. Haring v. Prosise, 462 U. S. 306, 314, and n. 8 (198&amp;); Smith, Full Faith and Credit and Section 1983: A Reappraisal, 63 N. C. L. Rev. 59, 110-111 (1984). The Court\u2019s analysis in Kremer began with the finding that state law would in fact bar relitigation of the discrimination issue decided in the earlier state proceedings. 456 U. S., at 466-467. That finding implied that the plaintiff could not relitigate the same issue in federal court unless some exception to \u00a7 1738 applied. Ibid. Kremer observed that \u201can exception to \u00a7 1738 will not be recognized unless a later statute contains an express or implied repeal.\u201d Id., at 468; see also Allen v. McCurry, supra, at 99. Title VII does not expressly repeal \u00a7 1738, and the Court concluded that the statutory provisions and legislative history do not support a finding of implied repeal. 456 U. S., at 476. We conclude that the basic approach adopted in Kremer applies in a lawsuit involving a claim within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.\\nTo be sure, a state court will not have occasion to address the specific question whether a state judgment has issue or claim preclusive effect in a later action that can be brought *382only in federal court. Nevertheless, a federal court may rely in the first instance on state preclusion principles to determine the extent to which an earlier state judgment bars subsequent litigation. Cf. FDIC v. Eckhardt, 691 F. 2d 245, 247-248 (CA6 1982) (applying state law to determine preclu-sive effect on claim within concurrent jurisdiction of state and federal courts). Kremer illustrates that a federal court can apply state rules of issue preclusion to determine if a matter actually litigated in state court may be relitigated in a subsequent federal proceeding. See 456 U. S., at 467.\\nWith respect to matters that were not decided in the state proceedings, we note that claim preclusion generally does not apply where \u201c[t]he plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to seek a certain remedy because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts . . . .\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a726(l)(c) (1982). If state preclusion law includes this requirement of prior jurisdictional competency, which is generally true, a state judgment will not have claim preclusive effect on a cause of action within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. Even in the event that a party asserting the affirmative defense of claim preclusion can show that state preclusion rules in some circumstances bar a claim outside the jurisdiction of the court that rendered the initial judgment, the federal court should first consider whether application of the state rules would bar the particular federal claim.2\\n*383Reference to state preclusion law may make it unnecessary to determine if the federal court, as an exception to \u00a7 1738, should refuse to give preclusive effect to a state court judgment. The issue whether there is an exception to \u00a71738 arises only if state law indicates that litigation of a particular claim or issue should be barred in the subsequent federal pro-j ceeding. To the extent that state preclusion law indicates' that a judgment normally does not have claim preclusive effect as to matters that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain, lower courts and commentators have correctly concluded that a state court judgment does not bar a subsequent federal antitrust claim. See 726 F. 2d, at 1174 (Cudahy, J., dissenting) (citing cases); 692 F. 2d, at 1099 (Stewart, J., dissenting); Restatement, supra, \u00a725(1), Comment e; id., \u00a726(1)(c), Illustration 2; 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74470, pp. 687-688 (1981). Unless application of Illinois preclusion law suggests, contrary to the usual view, that petitioners\u2019 federal antitrust claim is somehow barred, there will be no need to decide in this case if there is an exception to \u00a7 1738.3\\n*384The Court of Appeals did not apply the approach to \u00a7 1738 that we have outlined. Both the plurality opinion, see 726 F. 2d, at 1154, and an opinion concurring in part, see id., at 1163-1164 (Flaum, J.), express the view that \u00a7 1738 allows a federal court to give a state court judgment greater preclusive effect than the state courts themselves would give to it. This proposition, however, was rejected by Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U. S. 75 (1984), a case decided shortly after the Court of Appeals announced its decision in the instant case. In Migra, a discharged schoolteacher filed suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 in federal court after she prevailed in state court on a contract claim involving the same underlying events. The Federal District Court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 action as barred by claim preclusion. The opinion of this Court emphasized that under \u00a7 1738, state law determined the preclusive effect of the state judgment. Id., at 81. Because it was unclear from the record whether the District Court\u2019s ruling was based on state preclusion law, we remanded for clarification on this point. Id., at 87. Such a remand obviously would have been unnecessary were a federal court free to give greater preclusive effect to a state court judgment than would the judgment-rendering State. See id., at 88 (White, J., concurring).\\n; We are unwilling to create a special exception to \u00a7 1738 for federal antitrust claims that would give state court judg-ements greater preclusive effect than would the courts of the State rendering the judgment. Cf. Haring v. Prosise, 462 U. S., at 317-318 (refusing to create special preclusion rule for \u00a7 1983 claim subsequent to plaintiff\u2019s guilty plea). The plurality opinion for the Court of Appeals relied on Federated *385Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U. S. 394 (1981), to observe that the doctrine of claim preclusion protects defendants from repetitive lawsuits based on the same conduct, 726 F. 2d, at 1152, and that there is a practical need to require plaintiffs \u201cto litigate their claims in an economical and parsimonious fashion.\u201d Id., at 1153. We agree that these are valid and important concerns, and we note that under \u00a7 1738 state issue preclusion law may promote the goals of repose and conservation of judicial resources by preventing the relitigation of certain issues in a subsequent federal proceeding. See Kremer, 456 U. S., at 485 (state judgment barred subsequent Title VII action in federal court).\\nIf we had a single system of courts and our only concerns were efficiency and finality, it might be desirable to fashion claim preclusion rules that would require a plaintiff to bring suit initially in the forum of most general jurisdiction, thereby resolving as many issues as possible in one proceeding. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a724, Comment g (1982); C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, supra, \u00a7 4407, p. 51; id. \u00a7 4412, p. 93. The decision of the Court of Appeals approximates such a rule inasmuch as it encourages plaintiffs to file suit initially in federal district court and to attempt to bring any state law claims pendent to their federal antitrust claims. Whether this result would reduce the overall burden of litigation is debatable, see 726 F. 2d, at 1181-1182 (Cudahy, J., dissenting); C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, supra, \u00a74407, p. 51-52, and we decline to base our interpretation of \u00a7 1738 on our opinion on this question.\\nMore importantly, we have parallel systems of state and federal courts, and the concerns of comity reflected in \u00a7 1738.. \/ generally allow States to determine the preclusive scope \/ of their own courts\u2019 judgments. See Kremer, supra, at\/ 481-482; Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S., at 96; cf. Currie, Reg Judicata: The Neglected Defense, 45 U. Chi. L. Rev. 317, 327 (1978) (state policies may seek to limit preclusive effect of state court judgment). These concerns certainly are not made less compelling because state courts lack jurisdiction *386over federal antitrust claims. We therefore reject a judicially created exception to \u00a7 1738 that effectively holds as a matter of federal law that a plaintiff can bring state law claims initially in state court only at the cost of forgoing subsequent federal antitrust claims. Federated Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie does not suggest a contrary conclusion. That case did not involve \u00a7 1738; rather it held that \u201caccepted principles of res judicata\u201d determine the preclusive effect of a federal court judgment. See 452 U. S., at 401.\\nIn this case the Court of Appeals should have first referred to Illinois law to determine the preclusive effect of the state judgment. Only if state law indicates that a particular claim or issue would be barred, is it necessary to determine if an exception to \u00a7 1738 should apply. Although for purposes of this case, we need not decide if such an exception exists for federal antitrust claims, we observe that the more general question is whether the concerns underlying a particular grant of exclusive jurisdiction justify a finding of an implied partial repeal of \u00a7 1738. Resolution of this question will depend on the particular federal statute as well as the nature of the claim or issue involved in the subsequent federal action. Our previous decisions indicate that the primary consideration must be the intent of Congress. See Kremer, supra, at 470-476 (finding no congressional intent to depart from \u00a7 1738 for purposes of Title VII); cf. Brown v. Felsen, 442 U. S. 127, 138 (1979) (finding congressional intent that state judgments would not have claim preclusive effect on dischargeability issue in bankruptcy).\\nIV\\nThe decisions below did not consider Illinois preclusion law in their discussion of the claim preclusion issue. The District Court relied on federal law to conclude that the state judgments did not bar the claims under the Sherman Act. See 496 F. Supp., at 238-239. Similarly, the plurality opinion of the Court of Apneals did not discuss Illinois principles of *387claim preclusion. See 726 F. 2d, at 1164. Although an opinion concurring in part also concluded that petitioners\u2019 antitrust claim was barred as a matter of federal law, it did suggest that this conclusion was consistent with Illinois law. See id., at 1164 (Flaum, J.). A dissenting opinion vigorously argued that principles of Illinois claim preclusion law did not require dismissal of the federal antitrust claims. See id., at 1176-1177 (Cudahy, J.). Before this Court, the parties have continued to disagree about the content of Illinois preclusion law. We believe that this dispute is best resolved in the first instance by the District Court. Cf. Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U. S., at 87.\\nPetitioners also urge us to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals with respect to the contempt order. We specifically declined to grant certiorari on questions related to the discovery order or the subsequent contempt order, and we do not address those issues here.\\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\nJustice Blackmun and Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\\n\\n In this opinion we use the term \u201cclaim preclusion\u201d to refer to \u201cres judicata\u201d in a narrow sense, i. e., the preclusive effect of a judgment in foreclosing litigation of matters that should have been raised in an earlier suit. In contrast, we use the term \u201cissue preclusion\u201d to refer to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing relitigation of a matter that has been litigated and decided. See Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U. S. 75, 77, n. 1 (1984).\\n\\n\\n Our analysis does not necessarily suggest that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit erred in its holding in Nash County Board of Education v. Biltmore Co., 640 F. 2d 484, cert. denied, 454 U. S. 878 (1981). The Court of Appeals there applied federal preclusion principles to conclude that a state judgment approving settlement of state antitrust claims barred a subsequent federal antitrust claim. Although our decision today indicates that the Court of Appeals should have looked in the first instance to state law to determine the preclusive effect of the state judgment, the same holding would result if application of state preclusion law suggests *383that the settlement bars the subsequent federal claim and if there is no exception to \u00a7 1738 in these circumstances. Cf. 640 F. 2d, at 487, n. 5 (noting that state law gives preclusive effect to consent judgment). We, of course, do not address those issues here.\\n\\n\\n The Chief Justice notes that preclusion rules bar the splitting of a cause of action between a court of limited jurisdiction and one of general jurisdiction, and suggests that state requirements of jurisdictional competency may leave unclear whether a state court action precludes a subsequent federal antitrust claim. Post, at 388-390. The rule that the judgment of a court of limited jurisdiction concludes the entire claim assumes that the plaintiff might have commenced his action in a court in the same system of courts that was competent to give full relief. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24, Comment g (1982). Moreover, the jurisdictional competency requirement generally is understood to imply that state court litigation based on a state statute analogous to a federal statute, e. g., a state antitrust law, does not bar subsequent attempts to secure *384relief in federal court if the state court lacked jurisdiction over the federal statutory claim. Id., \u00a7 26(l)(c), Illustration 2. Although a particular State\u2019s preclusion principles conceivably could support a rule similar to that proposed by The Chief Justice, post, at 390-391, where state preclusion rules do not indicate that a claim is barred, we do not believe that federal courts should fashion a federal rule to preclude a claim that could not have been raised in the state proceedings.\\n\\n\", 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 9429933}, {'author_str': 'Burger', 'per_curiam': False, 'type': '030concurrence', 'page_count': None, 'download_url': None, 'author_id': None, 'opinion_text': '\\nChief Justice Burger,\\nconcurring in the judgment.\\nI agree with the Court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the Court of Appeals approached 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1738 too narrowly and technically by holding it irrelevant on the ground that Illinois law does not address the preclusive effect of a state court judgment on a federal antitrust suit, see 726 F. 2d 1150, 1154 (1984). In the circumstances presented by this case, a fair reading of \u00a7 1738 requires federal courts to look first to general principles of state preclusion law. Those principles control if they clearly establish that the state court judgment does not bar the later federal action: Only recently, we re*388affirmed in Migra v. Warren City School District Board of Education, 465 U. S. 75 (1984), that a federal court is not free to accord greater preclusive effect to a state court judgment than the state courts themselves would give to it.\\nThe Court now remands with directions for the District Court to consider Illinois claim preclusion law, but no guidance is given as to how the District Court should proceed if it finds state law silent or indeterminate on the claim preclusion question. The Court\u2019s refusal to acknowledge this potential problem appears to stem from a belief that the jurisdictional competency requirement of res judicata doctrine will dispose of most cases like this. See ante, at 882.\\nI cannot agree with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the jurisdictional competency requirement. If state law provides a cause of action that is virtually identical with a federal statutory cause of action, a plaintiff suing in state court is able to rely on the same theory of the case and obtain the same remedy as would be available in federal court, even when the plaintiff cannot expressly invoke the federal statute because it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. In this situation, the jurisdictional competency requirement is effectively satisfied. Therefore, the fact that state law recognizes the jurisdictional competency requirement does not necessarily imply that a state court judgment has no claim preclusive effect on a cause of action within exclusive federal jurisdiction.\\nThe states that recognize the jurisdictional competency requirement do not all define it in the same terms. Illinois courts have expressed the doctrine in the following manner: \u201cThe principle [of res judicata] extends not only to questions which were actually litigated but also to all questions which could have been raised or determined.\u201d Spiller v. Continental Tube Co., 95 Ill. 2d 423, 432, 447 N. E. 2d 834, 838 (1983) (emphasis added); see also, e. g., LaSalle National Bank v. County Board of School Trustees, 61 Ill. 2d 524, 529, 337 N. E. 2d 19, 22 (1975); People v. Kidd, 398 Ill. 405, 408, 75 N. E. 2d 851, 853-854 (1947). In the present case, each *389petitioner could have alleged a cause of action under the Illinois Antitrust Act, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, \u00b660 \u2014 1 et seq. (1981), in his prior state court lawsuit against respondent. The principles of Illinois res judicata doctrine appear to be indeterminate as to whether petitioners\u2019 ability to raise state antitrust claims in their prior state court suits should preclude their assertion of essentially the same claims in the present federal action. This indeterminacy arises from the fact that the Illinois courts have not addressed whether the notion of \u201cquestions which could have been raised\u201d should be applied narrowly1 or broadly.2 No Illinois court has considered how the jurisdictional competency requirement should apply in the type of situation presented by this case, where the same theory of recovery may be asserted under different statutes. Nor has any Illinois court considered whether res judicata precludes splitting a cause of action between a court of limited jurisdiction and one of general jurisdiction.3\\n*390Hence it is likely that the principles of Illinois claim preclusion law do not speak to the preclusive effect that petitioners\u2019 state court judgments should have on the present action. In this situation, it may be consistent with \u00a7 1738 for a federal court to formulate a federal rule to resolve the matter. If state law is simply indeterminate, the concerns of comity and federalism underlying \u00a7 1738 do not come into play. At the same time, the federal courts have direct interests in ensuring that their resources are used efficiently and not as a means of harassing defendants with repetitive lawsuits, as well as in ensuring that parties asserting federal rights have an adequate opportunity to litigate those rights. Given the insubstantiality of the state interests and the weight of the federal interests, a strong argument could be made that a federal rule would be more appropriate than a creative interpretation of ambiguous state law.4 When state law is indeterminate or ambiguous, a clear federal rule would promote substantive interests as well: \u201cUncertainty intrinsically works to defeat the opportunities for repose and reliance sought by the rules of preclusion, and confounds the desire for efficiency by inviting repetitious litigation to test the pre-clusive effects of the first effort.\u201d 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, supra n. 3, \u00a74407, at 49.\\nA federal rule, might be fashioned from the test, which this Court has applied in other contexts, that a party is precluded *391from asserting a claim that he had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to litigate in a prior action. See, e. g., Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 485 (1982); Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 95 (1980); Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147, 153 (1979); Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, 402 U. S. 313, 328 (1971). Thus, if a state statute is identical in all material respects with a federal statute within exclusive federal jurisdiction, a party\u2019s ability to assert a claim under the state statute in a prior state court action might be said to have provided, in effect^ a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to litigate his rights under the federal statute. Cf. Derish v. San Mateo-Burlingame Board of Realtors, 724 F. 2d 1347 (CA9 1983); Nash County Board of Education v. Biltmore Co., 640 F. 2d 484 (CA4), cert. denied, 454 U. S. 878 (1981).\\nThe Court will eventually have to face these questions; I would resolve them now.\\n\\n E. g., by inquiring whether the plaintiff could have raised the question whether the defendant violated a particular statute.\\n\\n\\n E. g., by inquiring whether the plaintiff could have raised the question whether the defendant engaged in a group boycott.\\n\\n\\n Compare Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24, Comment g, Illustration 14, pp. 204-205 (1982):\\n\u201cIn an automobile collision, A is injured and his car damaged as a result of the negligence of B. Instead of suing in a court of general jurisdiction of the state, A brings his action for the damage to his car in a justice\u2019s court, which has jurisdiction in actions for damage to property but has no jurisdiction in actions for injury to the person. Judgment is rendered for A for the damage to the ear. A cannot thereafter maintain an action against B to recover for the injury to his person arising out of the same collision.\u201d See also 18 C.

Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4412, p. 95 (1981), stating that the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d in state courts is that \u201c[a] second action will not be permitted on parts of a single claim that could have been asserted in a court of broader jurisdiction simply because the plaintiff went first to a court of limited jurisdiction in the same state that could not hear them.\u201d The holding in Lucas v. Le Compte, 42 Ill. 303 (1866), is similar to this \u201cgeneral rule,\u201d but that holding was based on a construction of an Illinois statute, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 59, \u00a735 (1845), which (a) has been repealed, see Act of Apr. 15, 1965, 1965 Ill. Laws 331, and (b) *390had a broader preclusive effect than general Illinois res judicata doctrine has. Clancey v. McBride, 338 Ill. 35, 169 N. E. 729 (1929), involved the same circumstances as the above-quoted illustration from the Restatement. The court resolved the case, however, without reference to the limited jurisdiction of the justice\u2019s court, by concluding that injury to the person and injury to property are distinct legal wrongs that can be the subject of separate lawsuits.\\n\\n\\n By contrast, when a federal court construes substantive rights and obligations under state law in the context of a diversity action, the federal interest is insignificant and the state\u2019s interest is much more direct than it is in the present situation, even if the relevant state law is ambiguous.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 9429934}, {'author_str': None, 'per_curiam': False, 'type': '010combined', 'page_count': None, 'download_url': None, 'author_id': None, 'opinion_text': '\\n470 U.S. 373 (1985)\\nMARRESE ET AL.\\nv.\\nAMERICAN ACADEMY OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEONS\\nNo. 83-1452.\\nSupreme Court of United States.\\nArgued December 4, 1984\\nDecided March 4, 1985\\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\\n*374 Michael T.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, held as a matter of federal law that the earlier state court judgments barred the federal antitrust suit. 726 F. 2d 1150 (1984). Under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1738, a federal court generally is required to consider first the law of the State in which the judgment was rendered to determine its preclusive effect. Because the lower courts did not consider state preclusion law in this case, we reverse and remand.\\n\\nI\\nPetitioners are board-certified orthopaedic surgeons who applied for membership in respondent American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (Academy). Respondent denied the membership applications without providing a hearing or a statement of reasons. In November 1976, petitioner Dr. Treister filed suit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, State of Illinois, alleging that the denial of membership in the Academy violated associational rights protected by Illinois common law. Petitioner Dr. Marrese separately filed a similar action in state court. Neither petitioner alleged a violation of state antitrust law in his state court action; nor did either petitioner contemporaneously file a federal antitrust suit. The Illinois Appellate Court ultimately held that Dr. Treister\\'s complaint failed to state a cause of action, Treister v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 78 Ill. App. 3d 746, 396 N. E. 2d 1225 (1979), and the Illinois Supreme Court denied leave to appeal. 79 Ill. 2d 630 (1980). After the Appellate Court ruled against Dr. Treister, the Circuit Court dismissed Dr. Marrese\\'s complaint.\\n*376 In March 1980, petitioners filed a federal antitrust suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois based on the same events underlying their unsuccessful state court actions. As amended, the complaint alleged that respondent Academy possesses monopoly power, that petitioners were denied membership in order to discourage competition, and that their exclusion constituted a boycott in violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1. App. 8, 26-30, 33. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss arguing that claim preclusion barred the federal antitrust claim because the earlier state court actions concerned the same facts and were dismissed with prejudice.[1] In denying this motion, the District Court reasoned that state courts lack jurisdiction over federal antitrust claims, and therefore a state court judgment cannot have claim preclusive effect in a subsequent federal antitrust suit. 496 F. Supp. 236, 238-239 (1980), on reconsideration, 524 F. Supp. 389 (1981). Discovery began and respondent refused to allow petitioners access to certain files relating to membership applications. After respondent persisted in this refusal despite a discovery order, the District Court held respondent in criminal contempt. App. to Pet. for Cert. N-1.\\nThe judgment of contempt was reversed by a divided panel of the Court of Appeals in an opinion holding that the District Judge had abused his discretion by authorizing discovery of the membership files and also suggesting that the federal action was barred by claim preclusion and that the antitrust claims were groundless. 692 F. 2d 1083 (1982). This opinion was vacated by an en banc vote, and the original panel issued a narrower opinion that did not discuss claim preclusion. *377 706 F. 2d 1488 (1983). The Court of Appeals then vacated the second opinion and ordered rehearing en banc. In a divided vote, the Court of Appeals held that claim preclusion barred the federal antitrust suit and reversed the contempt order because the discovery order was invalid. 726 F. 2d 1150 (1984).\\nOn the claim preclusion issue, no opinion commanded the votes of a majority of the Court of Appeals. A plurality opinion concluded that a state court judgment bars the subsequent filing of a federal antitrust claim if the plaintiff could have brought a state antitrust claim under a state statute \"materially identical\" to the Sherman Act. Id., at 1153. The plurality examined the Illinois Antitrust Act, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, \u00b6 60-3(2) (1981), and found that it is sufficiently similar to the Sherman Act to bar petitioners\\' federal antitrust claims in the instant case. Id., at 1155-1156. An opinion concurring in part concluded that res judicata required petitioners to bring their \"entire cause of action within a reasonable period of time.\" Id., at 1166 (Flaum, J.). To avoid preclusion of their federal antitrust claim, petitioners should have either filed concurrent state and federal actions or brought their state claims in federal court pendent to their Sherman Act claim. Ibid.\\nFive judges also concluded that the discovery order was invalid and therefore the contempt judgment should be reversed. A plurality opinion first observed that the discovery order was invalid because the District Court should have dismissed the suit on claim preclusion grounds before the discovery order was entered. Id., at 1158. Alternatively, the order constituted an abuse of discretion because it did not adequately prevent petitioners from misusing the discovery process. Id., at 1158-1162. Three judges joined the entire discussion concerning the discovery order. A fourth judge did not believe that claim preclusion applied, but he agreed that the discovery order constituted an abuse of discretion. Id., at 1162 (Eschbach, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Finally, the fifth judge observed that it was sufficient *378 to hold that the complaint should have been dismissed on claim preclusion grounds; he added, however, that if he thought it necessary he would join the portion of the plurality opinion holding the discovery order invalid. Id., at 1162 (Bauer, J., concurring).\\nWe granted certiorari limited to the question whether the Court of Appeals correctly held that claim preclusion requires dismissal of the federal antitrust action, 467 U. S. 1258 (1984), and we now reverse.\\n\\nII\\nBefore addressing the merits of the decision below, we first examine whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the District Court\\'s denial of the motion to dismiss. Although the parties did not raise the jurisdictional issue before this Court, we address it to assure that the claim preclusion issue is properly before us. See, e. g., United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U. S. 192, 197 (1956). In the present case, the District Court initially refused to certify its denial of the motion to dismiss for immediate appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1292(b). The District Court subsequently held respondent in criminal contempt for refusing to comply with a discovery order. Respondent then appealed from the judgment of criminal contempt pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1291. See Bray v. United States, 423 U. S. 73 (1975) (per curiam). While the appeal from the contempt judgment was pending, the District Court amended the earlier denial of the motion to dismiss in order to certify it for immediate appeal. App. to Pet. for Cert. I-1. The Court of Appeals authorized interlocutory appeal pursuant to \u00a7 1292(b), and ordered proceedings consolidated with the appeal from the contempt order. 726 F. 2d, at 1152; App. to Pet. for Cert. J-1.\\nPetitioners argued below that because the appeal from the contempt order was pending, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to amend its order denying the motion to dismiss to *379 allow interlocutory appeal. In general, filing of a notice of appeal confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal. Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 58 (1982) (per curiam). This proposition, however, does not imply that an appeal from a judgment of criminal contempt based on noncompliance with a discovery order transfers jurisdiction over the entire case to the court of appeals. Criminal contempt judgments are immediately appealable pursuant to \u00a7 1291 because they result from \" `a separate and independent proceeding . . . to vindicate the authority of the court\\' \" and are \" `not a part of the original cause.\\' \" Bray, supra, at 75, quoting Gompers v. Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 445, 451 (1911).\\nThus, prior to certification of the claim preclusion issue pursuant to \u00a7 1292(b), the contempt judgment was the only matter before the Court of Appeals. See 706 F. 2d, at 1497-1498; 692 F. 2d, at 1096. The District Court\\'s amendment of its initial denial of the motion to dismiss did not interfere with but instead facilitated review of the pending appeal from the contempt order. We agree with the Court of Appeals, 726 F. 2d, at 1152, that the pendency of the appeal from the contempt judgment did not prevent the District Court from certifying the denial of the motion to dismiss for immediate appeal under \u00a7 1292(b). Accordingly, the Court of Appeals properly exercised jurisdiction over the consolidated appeals, and we have jurisdiction to review that court\\'s decision with respect to dismissal of the antitrust claim.\\n\\nIII\\nThe issue presented by this case is whether a state court judgment may have preclusive effect on a federal antitrust claim that could not have been raised in the state proceeding. Although federal antitrust claims are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts, see, e. g., General Investment *380 Co. v. Lake Shore &amp; M. S. R. Co., 260 U. S. 261, 286-288 (1922), the Court of Appeals ruled that the dismissal of petitioners\\' complaints in state court barred them from bringing a claim based on the same facts under the Sherman Act. The Court of Appeals erred by suggesting that in these circumstances a federal court should determine the preclusive effect of a state court judgment without regard to the law of the State in which judgment was rendered.\\nThe preclusive effect of a state court judgment in a subsequent federal lawsuit generally is determined by the full faith and credit statute, which provides that state judicial proceedings \"shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States . . . as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State . . . from which they are taken.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1738. This statute directs a federal court to refer to the preclusion law of the State in which judgment was rendered. \"It has long been established that \u00a7 1738 does not allow federal courts to employ their own rules of res judicata in determining the effect of state judgments. Rather, it goes beyond the common law and commands a federal court to accept the rules chosen by the State from which the judgment is taken.\" Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 481-482 (1982); see also Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 96 (1980). Section 1738 embodies concerns of comity and federalism that allow the States to determine, subject to the requirements of the statute and the Due Process Clause, the preclusive effect of judgments in their own courts. See Kremer, supra, at 478, 481-483. Cf. Riley v. New York Trust Co., 315 U. S. 343, 349 (1942) (discussing preclusive effect of state judgment in proceedings in another State).\\nThe fact that petitioners\\' antitrust claim is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts does not necessarily make \u00a7 1738 inapplicable to this case. Our decisions indicate that a state court judgment may in some circumstances have preclusive effect in a subsequent action within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. Without discussing \u00a7 1738, *381 this Court has held that the issue preclusive effect of a state court judgment barred a subsequent patent suit that could not have been brought in state court. Becher v. Contoure Laboratories, Inc., 279 U. S. 388 (1929). Moreover, Kremer held that \u00a7 1738 applies to a claim of employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., although the Court expressly declined to decide whether Title VII claims can be brought only in federal courts. 456 U. S., at 479, n. 20. Kremer implies that absent an exception to \u00a7 1738, state law determines at least the issue preclusive effect of a prior state judgment in a subsequent action involving a claim within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.\\nMore generally, Kremer indicates that \u00a7 1738 requires a federal court to look first to state preclusion law in determining the preclusive effects of a state court judgment. Cf. Haring v. Prosise, 462 U. S. 306, 314, and n. 8 (1983); Smith, Full Faith and Credit and Section 1983; A Reappraisal, 63 N. C. L. Rev. 59, 110-111 (1984). The Court\\'s analysis in Kremer began with the finding that state law would in fact bar relitigation of the discrimination issue decided in the earlier state proceedings. 456 U. S., at 466-467. That finding implied that the plaintiff could not relitigate the same issue in federal court unless some exception to \u00a7 1738 applied. Ibid. Kremer observed that \"an exception to \u00a7 1738 will not be recognized unless a later statute contains an express or implied repeal.\" Id., at 468; see also Allen v. McCurry, supra, at 99. Title VII does not expressly repeal \u00a7 1738, and the Court concluded that the statutory provisions and legislative history do not support a finding of implied repeal. 456 U. S., at 476. We conclude that the basic approach adopted in Kremer applies in a lawsuit involving a claim within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.\\nTo be sure, a state court will not have occasion to address the specific question whether a state judgment has issue or claim preclusive effect in a later action that can be brought *382 only in federal court. Nevertheless, a federal court may rely in the first instance on state preclusion principles to determine the extent to which an earlier state judgment bars subsequent litigation. Cf. FDIC v. Eckhardt, 691 F. 2d 245, 247-248 (CA6 1982) (applying state law to determine preclusive effect on claim within concurrent jurisdiction of state and federal courts). Kremer illustrates that a federal court can apply state rules of issue preclusion to determine if a matter actually litigated in state court may be relitigated in a subsequent federal proceeding. See 456 U. S., at 467.\\nWith respect to matters that were not decided in the state proceedings, we note that claim preclusion generally does not apply where \"[t]he plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to seek a certain remedy because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts. . . .\" Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 26(1)(c) (1982). If state preclusion law includes this requirement of prior jurisdictional competency, which is generally true, a state judgment will not have claim preclusive effect on a cause of action within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. Even in the event that a party asserting the affirmative defense of claim preclusion can show that state preclusion rules in some circumstances bar a claim outside the jurisdiction of the court that rendered the initial judgment, the federal court should first consider whether application of the state rules would bar the particular federal claim.[2]\\n*383 Reference to state preclusion law may make it unnecessary to determine if the federal court, as an exception to \u00a7 1738, should refuse to give preclusive effect to a state court judgment. The issue whether there is an exception to \u00a7 1738 arises only if state law indicates that litigation of a particular claim or issue should be barred in the subsequent federal proceeding. To the extent that state preclusion law indicates that a judgment normally does not have claim preclusive effect as to matters that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain, lower courts and commentators have correctly concluded that a state court judgment does not bar a subsequent federal antitrust claim. See 726 F. 2d, at 1174 (Cudahy, J., dissenting) (citing cases); 692 F. 2d, at 1099 (Stewart, J., dissenting); Restatement, supra, \u00a7 25(1), Comment e; id., \u00a7 26(1)(c), Illustration 2; 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4470, pp. 687-688 (1981). Unless application of Illinois preclusion law suggests, contrary to the usual view, that petitioners\\' federal antitrust claim is somehow barred, there will be no need to decide in this case if there is an exception to \u00a7 1738.[3]\\n*384 The Court of Appeals did not apply the approach to \u00a7 1738 that we have outlined. Both the plurality opinion, see 726 F. 2d, at 1154, and an opinion concurring in part, see id., at 1163-1164 (Flaum, J.), express the view that \u00a7 1738 allows a federal court to give a state court judgment greater preclusive effect than the state courts themselves would give to it. This proposition, however, was rejected by Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U. S. 75 (1984), a case decided shortly after the Court of Appeals announced its decision in the instant case. In Migra, a discharged school-teacher filed suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 in federal court after she prevailed in state court on a contract claim involving the same underlying events. The Federal District Court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 action as barred by claim preclusion. The opinion of this Court emphasized that under \u00a7 1738, state law determined the preclusive effect of the state judgment. Id., at 81. Because it was unclear from the record whether the District Court\\'s ruling was based on state preclusion law, we remanded for clarification on this point. Id., at 87. Such a remand obviously would have been unnecessary were a federal court free to give greater preclusive effect to a state court judgment than would the judgment-rendering State. See id., at 88 (WHITE, J., concurring).\\nWe are unwilling to create a special exception to \u00a7 1738 for federal antitrust claims that would give state court judgments greater preclusive effect than would the courts of the State rendering the judgment. Cf. Haring v. Prosise, 462 U. S., at 317-318 (refusing to create special preclusion rule for \u00a7 1983 claim subsequent to plaintiff\\'s guilty plea). The plurality opinion for the Court of Appeals relied on Federated *385 Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U. S. 394 (1981), to observe that the doctrine of claim preclusion protects defendants from repetitive lawsuits based on the same conduct, 726 F. 2d, at 1152, and that there is a practical need to require plaintiffs \"to litigate their claims in an economical and parsimonious fashion.\" Id., at 1153. We agree that these are valid and important concerns, and we note that under \u00a7 1738 state issue preclusion law may promote the goals of repose and conservation of judicial resources by preventing the relitigation of certain issues in a subsequent federal proceeding. See Kremer, 456 U. S., at 485 (state judgment barred subsequent Title VII action in federal court).\\nIf we had a single system of courts and our only concerns were efficiency and finality, it might be desirable to fashion claim preclusion rules that would require a plaintiff to bring suit initially in the forum of most general jurisdiction, thereby resolving as many issues as possible in one proceeding. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24, Comment g (1982); C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, supra, \u00a7 4407, p. 51; id., \u00a7 4412, p. 93. The decision of the Court of Appeals approximates such a rule inasmuch as it encourages plaintiffs to file suit initially in federal district court and to attempt to bring any state law claims pendent to their federal antitrust claims. Whether this result would reduce the overall burden of litigation is debatable, see 726 F. 2d, at 1181-1182 (Cudahy, J., dissenting); C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, supra, \u00a7 4407, p. 51-52, and we decline to base our interpretation of \u00a7 1738 on our opinion on this question.\\nMore importantly, we have parallel systems of state and federal courts, and the concerns of comity reflected in \u00a7 1738 generally allow States to determine the preclusive scope of their own courts\\' judgments. See Kremer, supra, at 481-482; Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S., at 96; cf. Currie, Res Judicata: The Neglected Defense, 45 U. Chi. L. Rev. 317, 327 (1978) (state policies may seek to limit preclusive effect of state court judgment). These concerns certainly are not made less compelling because state courts lack jurisdiction *386 over federal antitrust claims. We therefore reject a judicially created exception to \u00a7 1738 that effectively holds as a matter of federal law that a plaintiff can bring state law claims initially in state court only at the cost of forgoing subsequent federal antitrust claims. Federated Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie does not suggest a contrary conclusion. That case did not involve \u00a7 1738; rather it held that \"accepted principles of res judicata\" determine the preclusive effect of a federal court judgment. See 452 U. S., at 401.\\nIn this case the Court of Appeals should have first referred to Illinois law to determine the preclusive effect of the state judgment. Only if state law indicates that a particular claim or issue would be barred, is it necessary to determine if an exception to \u00a7 1738 should apply. Although for purposes of this case, we need not decide if such an exception exists for federal antitrust claims, we observe that the more general question is whether the concerns underlying a particular grant of exclusive jurisdiction justify a finding of an implied partial repeal of \u00a7 1738. Resolution of this question will depend on the particular federal statute as well as the nature of the claim or issue involved in the subsequent federal action. Our previous decisions indicate that the primary consideration must be the intent of Congress. See Kremer, supra, at 470-476 (finding no congressional intent to depart from \u00a7 1738 for purposes of Title VII); cf. Brown v. Felsen, 442 U. S. 127, 138 (1979) (finding congressional intent that state judgments would not have claim preclusive effect on dischargeability issue in bankruptcy).\\n\\nIV\\nThe decisions below did not consider Illinois preclusion law in their discussion of the claim preclusion issue. The District Court relied on federal law to conclude that the state judgments did not bar the claims under the Sherman Act. See 496 F. Supp., at 238-239. Similarly, the plurality opinion of the Court of Appeals did not discuss Illinois principles of *387 claim preclusion. See 726 F. 2d, at 1154. Although an opinion concurring in part also concluded that petitioners\\' antitrust claim was barred as a matter of federal law, it did suggest that this conclusion was consistent with Illinois law. See id., at 1164 (Flaum, J.). A dissenting opinion vigorously argued that principles of Illinois claim preclusion law did not require dismissal of the federal antitrust claims. See id., at 1176-1177 (Cudahy, J.). Before this Court, the parties have continued to disagree about the content of Illinois preclusion law. We believe that this dispute is best resolved in the first instance by the District Court. Cf. Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U. S., at 87.\\nPetitioners also urge us to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals with respect to the contempt order. We specifically declined to grant certiorari on questions related to the discovery order or the subsequent contempt order, and we do not address those issues here.\\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\nJUSTICE BLACKMUN and JUSTICE STEVENS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\\nCHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring in the judgment.\\nI agree with the Court\\'s implicit conclusion that the Court of Appeals approached 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1738 too narrowly and technically by holding it irrelevant on the ground that Illinois law does not address the preclusive effect of a state court judgment on a federal antitrust suit, see 726 F. 2d 1150, 1154 (1984). In the circumstances presented by this case, a fair reading of \u00a7 1738 requires federal courts to look first to general principles of state preclusion law. Those principles control if they clearly establish that the state court judgment does not bar the later federal action: Only recently, we reaffirmed *388 in Migra v. Warren City School District Board of Education, 465 U. S. 75 (1984), that a federal court is not free to accord greater preclusive effect to a state court judgment than the state courts themselves would give to it.\\nThe Court now remands with directions for the District Court to consider Illinois claim preclusion law, but no guidance is given as to how the District Court should proceed if it finds state law silent or indeterminate on the claim preclusion question. The Court\\'s refusal to acknowledge this potential problem appears to stem from a belief that the jurisdictional competency requirement of res judicata doctrine will dispose of most cases like this. See ante, at 382.\\nI cannot agree with the Court\\'s interpretation of the jurisdictional competency requirement. If state law provides a cause of action that is virtually identical with a federal statutory cause of action, a plaintiff suing in state court is able to rely on the same theory of the case and obtain the same remedy as would be available in federal court, even when the plaintiff cannot expressly invoke the federal statute because it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. In this situation, the jurisdictional competency requirement is effectively satisfied. Therefore, the fact that state law recognizes the jurisdictional competency requirement does not necessarily imply that a state court judgment has no claim preclusive effect on a cause of action within exclusive federal jurisdiction.\\nThe states that recognize the jurisdictional competency requirement do not all define it in the same terms. Illinois courts have expressed the doctrine in the following manner: \"The principle [of res judicata] extends not only to questions which were actually litigated but also to all questions which could have been raised or determined.\" Spiller v. Continental Tube Co., 95 Ill. 2d 423, 432, 447 N. E. 2d 834, 838 (1983) (emphasis added); see also, e. g., LaSalle National Bank v. County Board of School Trustees, 61 Ill. 2d 524, 529, 337 N. E. 2d 19, 22 (1975); People v. Kidd, 398 Ill. 405, 408, 75 N. E. 2d 851, 853-854 (1947). In the present case, each *389 petitioner could have alleged a cause of action under the Illinois Antitrust Act, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, \u00b6 60-1 et seq. (1981), in his prior state court lawsuit against respondent. The principles of Illinois res judicata doctrine appear to be indeterminate as to whether petitioners\\' ability to raise state antitrust claims in their prior state court suits should preclude their assertion of essentially the same claims in the present federal action. This indeterminacy arises from the fact that the Illinois courts have not addressed whether the notion of \"questions which could have been raised\" should be applied narrowly[1] or broadly.[2] No Illinois court has considered how the jurisdictional competency requirement should apply in the type of situation presented by this case, where the same theory of recovery may be asserted under different statutes. Nor has any Illinois court considered whether res judicata precludes splitting a cause of action between a court of limited jurisdiction and one of general jurisdiction.[3]\\n*390 Hence it is likely that the principles of Illinois claim preclusion law do not speak to the preclusive effect that petitioners\\' state court judgments should have on the present action. In this situation, it may be consistent with \u00a7 1738 for a federal court to formulate a federal rule to resolve the matter. If state law is simply indeterminate, the concerns of comity and federalism underlying \u00a7 1738 do not come into play. At the same time, the federal courts have direct interests in ensuring that their resources are used efficiently and not as a means of harassing defendants with repetitive lawsuits, as well as in ensuring that parties asserting federal rights have an adequate opportunity to litigate those rights. Given the insubstantiality of the state interests and the weight of the federal interests, a strong argument could be made that a federal rule would be more appropriate than a creative interpretation of ambiguous state law.[4] When state law is indeterminate or ambiguous, a clear federal rule would promote substantive interests as well: \"Uncertainty intrinsically works to defeat the opportunities for repose and reliance sought by the rules of preclusion, and confounds the desire for efficiency by inviting repetitious litigation to test the preclusive effects of the first effort.\" 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, supra, n. 3, \u00a7 4407, at 49.\\nA federal rule might be fashioned from the test, which this Court has applied in other contexts, that a party is precluded *391 from asserting a claim that he had a \"full and fair opportunity\" to litigate in a prior action. See, e. g., Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 485 (1982); Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 95 (1980); Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147, 153 (1979); Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, 402 U. S. 313, 328 (1971). Thus, if a state statute is identical in all material respects with a federal statute within exclusive federal jurisdiction, a party\\'s ability to assert a claim under the state statute in a prior state court action might be said to have provided, in effect, a \"full and fair opportunity\" to litigate his rights under the federal statute. Cf. Derish v. San Mateo-Burlingame Board of Realtors, 724 F. 2d 1347 (CA9 1983); Nash County Board of Education v. Biltmore Co., 640 F. 2d 484 (CA4), cert. denied, 454 U. S. 878 (1981).\\nThe Court will eventually have to face these questions; I would resolve them now.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  In this opinion we use the term \"claim preclusion\" to refer to \"res judicata\" in a narrow sense, i. e., the preclusive effect of a judgment in foreclosing litigation of matters that should have been raised in an earlier suit. In contrast, we use the term \"issue preclusion\" to refer to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing relitigation of a matter that has been litigated and decided. See Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U. S. 75, 77, n. 1 (1984).\\n[2]  Our analysis does not necessarily suggest that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit erred in its holding in Nash County Board of Education v. Biltmore Co., 640 F. 2d 484, cert. denied, 454 U. S. 878 (1981). The Court of Appeals there applied federal preclusion principles to conclude that a state judgment approving settlement of state antitrust claims barred a subsequent federal antitrust claim. Although our decision today indicates that the Court of Appeals should have looked in the first instance to state law to determine the preclusive effect of the state judgment, the same holding would result if application of state preclusion law suggests that the settlement bars the subsequent federal claim and if there is no exception to \u00a7 1738 in these circumstances. Cf. 640 F. 2d, at 487, n. 5 (noting that state law gives preclusive effect to consent judgment). We, of course, do not address those issues here.\\n[3]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE notes that preclusion rules bar the splitting of a cause of action between a court of limited jurisdiction and one of general jurisdiction, and suggests that state requirements of jurisdictional competency may leave unclear whether a state court action precludes a subsequent federal antitrust claim. Post, at 388-390. The rule that the judgment of a court of limited jurisdiction concludes the entire claim assumes that the plaintiff might have commenced his action in a court in the same system of courts that was competent to give full relief. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24, Comment g (1982). Moreover, the jurisdictional competency requirement generally is understood to imply that state court litigation based on a state statute analogous to a federal statute, e. g., a state antitrust law, does not bar subsequent attempts to secure relief in federal court if the state court lacked jurisdiction over the federal statutory claim. Id., \u00a7 26(1)(c), Illustration 2. Although a particular State\\'s preclusion principles conceivably could support a rule similar to that proposed by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, post, at 390-391, where state preclusion rules do not indicate that a claim is barred, we do not believe that federal courts should fashion a federal rule to preclude a claim that could not have been raised in the state proceedings.\\n[1]  E. g., by inquiring whether the plaintiff could have raised the question whether the defendant violated a particular statute.\\n[2]  E. g., by inquiring whether the plaintiff could have raised the question whether the defendant engaged in a group boycott.\\n[3]  Compare Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24, Comment g, Illustration 14, pp. 204-205 (1982):\\n\\n\"In an automobile collision, A is injured and his car damaged as a result of the negligence of B. Instead of suing in a court of general jurisdiction of the state, A brings his action for the damage to his car in a justice\\'s court, which has jurisdiction in actions for damage to property but has no jurisdiction in actions for injury to the person. Judgment is rendered for A for the damage to the car. A cannot thereafter maintain an action against B to recover for the injury to his person arising out of the same collision.\"\\nSee also 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4412, p. 95 (1981), stating that the \"general rule\" in state courts is that \"[a] second action will not be permitted on parts of a single claim that could have been asserted in a court of broader jurisdiction simply because the plaintiff went first to a court of limited jurisdiction in the same state that could not hear them.\" The holding in Lucas v. Le Compte, 42 Ill. 303 (1866), is similar to this \"general rule,\" but that holding was based on a construction of an Illinois statute, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 59, \u00a7 35 (1845), which (a) has been repealed, see Act of Apr. 15, 1965, 1965 Ill. Laws 331, and (b) had a broader preclusive effect than general Illinois res judicata doctrine has. Clancey v. McBride, 338 Ill. 35, 169 N. E. 729 (1929), involved the same circumstances as the above-quoted illustration from the Restatement. The court resolved the case, however, without reference to the limited jurisdiction of the justice\\'s court, by concluding that injury to the person and injury to property are distinct legal wrongs that can be the subject of separate lawsuits.\\n[4]  By contrast, when a federal court construes substantive rights and obligations under state law in the context of a diversity action, the federal interest is insignificant and the state\\'s interest is much more direct than it is in the present situation, even if the relevant state law is ambiguous.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 111365}]"},{"id":402104,"date_filed":"1982-04-26","judges":"Anderson, Morgan, Tjoflat","case_name_full":"Jean AVERY, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.

Following a bench trial, the court concluded that although one of the grounds of Avery\\'s discharge was arguably impermissible, the presence of another, permissible, ground rendered the termination lawful.  Accordingly, the court entered judgment for the defendants.  The district court erred by holding that the mere presence of a permissible ground for Avery\\'s discharge rendered the discharge lawful.  On the record before it, the court was required to enter judgment for Avery.  We therefore vacate the judgment of the district court and direct the entry of judgment for the plaintiff.\\n    \\n    I.\\n    \\n      2\\n      Jean Avery, a black woman, taught remedial reading at Shades Cahaba Elementary School in Homewood City, Alabama, from 1972 until her discharge on February 8, 1977.  A written policy of the Homewood City Board of Education (the Board) required teachers who became pregnant so to inform the Superintendent of Education (the Superintendent) no later than the fourth month of pregnancy (the notice rule).  In mid-November, 1976, Avery, who was not married, informed her principal that she was expecting to give birth in late December.  The principal commented that Avery was in violation of the notice rule and instructed her to inform the Superintendent of her pregnancy, which Avery did.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Avery and the Superintendent, Dr. French, discussed Avery\\'s situation in early December, 1976.  According to Dr. French\\'s testimony, he emphasized Avery\\'s violation of the notice rule.  According to Avery, Dr. French urged her to resign because of the \"moral issue\" of conception out of wedlock.1\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      In any event, Dr. French notified Avery by letter of December 15, 1976, that the Board would meet to determine whether to cancel her contract for three reasons: insubordination, neglect of duty, and immorality.  As Superintendent, Dr. French was authorized to recommend Avery\\'s dismissal, and the three grounds stated in the December 15 letter were charges he would be bringing before the Board.  As Dr. French testified, both \"insubordination\" and \"neglect of duty\" referred to Avery\\'s violation of the notice rule, and \"immorality\" referred to her pregnancy out of wedlock.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      On February 8, 1977, the Board voted to terminate Avery\\'s employment immediately, and instructed Dr. French so to inform Avery.  Dr. French did so by letter of February 11, 1977, specifying no reasons for the discharge.  At trial, however, Dr. French, who recorded and transcribed the Board\\'s deliberations as its secretary, testified that the reasons for the decision to dismiss Avery were the three grounds specified in the December 15 letter.  The decision of the Board was affirmed by the Alabama State Tenure Committee.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Avery sued the Board, Dr. French, and the Board members (collectively appellees), alleging that her discharge violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq.  (1976); Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1681 et seq.  (1976); 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981 (1976); and, because it deprived her of rights guaranteed by the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (1976).  She sought reinstatement with back pay, tenure status, lost benefits, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney\\'s fees.  Underlying each legal theory in the complaint was the premise that the Board unlawfully based its decision to dismiss Avery on her immoral conception of a child out of wedlock.  Avery has at no time claimed that the notice rule is unlawful either facially or as applied.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      The district court found that Avery\\'s employment had been terminated in part for immorality and acknowledged that a discharge for that reason might be unconstitutional.  However, the court found that it was not necessary to reach the issue:\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Immorality was only one of the grounds for termination.  Defendants contend that the plaintiff\\'s employment was also terminated on the grounds of insubordination or neglect of duty in not reporting her pregnancy.  Clearly she did not comply with the school rules with respect to reporting....  The notice rule ... is reasonable, and the School Board was justified in terminating her for this refusal.  That being the case, the court finds it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue and the other issues raised by plaintiff.\\n    \\n    II.\\n    \\n      9\\n      The district court held in effect that, without regard to the immorality charge, Avery\\'s dismissal was lawful because it was based in part on a permissible ground.  This holding contravened the standards of proof and causation mandated by the Supreme Court for mixed-motive discharge cases such as this one.  In Mt. Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), a teacher, who had previously been involved in an altercation with another teacher, an argument with school cafeteria employees, and incidents in which he swore at and made obscene gestures to students, communicated to a radio station the substance of a memorandum from his principal relating to teacher dress and appearance.  The radio station announced the adoption of the dress code as a news item.  Thereafter, the school board advised the teacher that he would not be rehired, citing his lack of tact in handling professional matters, with specific reference to the radio station and obscene gesture incidents.  Claiming that the discharge violated his first and fourteenth amendment rights, the teacher sought reinstatement and damages in a suit against the school board.  The district court concluded that the communication to the radio station was protected by the first amendment, and that because it had played a substantial part in the decision to discharge the teacher, he was entitled to reinstatement with back pay.  The court of appeals affirmed.  On certiorari, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the case.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      The Court concluded that the fact that constitutionally protected conduct played a substantial part in the termination decision did not necessarily indicate a constitutional violation justifying remedial action.  429 U.S. at 285, 97 S.Ct. at 575.  Rather, the proper test would protect against the invasion of constitutional rights without commanding consequences not necessary to the assurance of those rights:\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Initially, ... the burden was properly placed upon (the plaintiff) to show that his conduct was constitutionally protected, and that this conduct was a \"substantial factor\"-or to put it in other words, that it was a \"motivating factor\" in the Board\\'s decision not to rehire him.  (Plaintiff) having carried that burden, however, the District Court should have gone on to determine whether the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to (plaintiff\\'s) reemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Id. at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576 (footnote omitted).\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      The framework of proof established in Mt. Healthy applies to Avery\\'s constitutional claims.2  The burden was initially on Avery to show that her conduct was constitutionally protected and was a substantial or a motivating factor in the Board\\'s decision to discharge her.  We assume, arguendo, that Avery\\'s out of wedlock pregnancy was constitutionally protected.  The district court found that the pregnancy was one of the reasons for Avery\\'s discharge; the appellees did not dispute at trial that a motivating factor in Avery\\'s discharge was immorality, and do not challenge the district court\\'s finding to that effect on appeal.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Having found that Avery had carried her initial burden, the district court should have gone on to determine whether the appellees had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that they would have discharged Avery even in the absence of her out of wedlock pregnancy.  Since the court instead held that the other, unchallenged, ground for Avery\\'s dismissal rendered the Board\\'s decision lawful, the district court\\'s judgment must be vacated.\\n    \\n    III.\\n    \\n      15\\n      Having concluded that the district court\\'s application of the wrong framework of proof caused it to neglect an essential factual inquiry, our usual course would be to remand the case to the district court for that inquiry.  Having thoroughly reviewed the record, however, we are convinced that the district court could not permissibly find that the appellees proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the Board would have discharged Avery even absent her out of wedlock pregnancy.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      The appellees insist that the record shows that Avery\\'s violation of the notice rule was a substantial factor in the Board\\'s decision to discharge her.  This is correct, but irrelevant; the appellees\\' burden was to prove not that their decision was substantially motivated by that violation, but rather that Avery would have been dismissed even in the absence of her out of wedlock pregnancy.  The record includes no evidence whatever to permit that inference.  Dr. French charged Avery with immorality when he recommended her discharge and, according to Dr. French\\'s testimony, the reasons for her discharge were the three grounds specified in his December 15 letter.  Neither Dr. French nor the one Board member who testified offered any evidence, direct or circumstantial, to suggest what they would have done about Avery\\'s violation of the notice rule if she had been married.3  The appellees offered no evidence of the Board\\'s treatment of married teachers who had violated the notice rule.4  Since no evidence in the record supports the proposition that Avery would have been dismissed absent consideration of her out of wedlock pregnancy, we would set aside as clearly erroneous a finding by the district court that the appellees proved that proposition by a preponderance of the evidence.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).  Therefore, we find that the appellees did not carry their burden to show that they would have discharged Avery even absent her asserted immorality.5\\n    \\n    IV.\\n    \\n      17\\n      The only remaining question is whether a discharge on account of pregnancy out of wedlock is, as Avery maintains, unlawful.  As we have noted, Avery challenges her dismissal on both statutory and constitutional grounds.  Ordinarily, we would address the statutory claims first.  However, the presence in this case of controlling authority that Avery\\'s discharge on account of unwed pregnancy was unconstitutional counsels that we address Avery\\'s constitutional claims first.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      In Andrews v. Drew Municipal Separate School Dist., 507 F.2d 611 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, 425 U.S. 559, 96 S.Ct. 1752, 48 L.Ed.2d 169 (1976), the defendant school district automatically disqualified from employment any parent of an illegitimate child.  In a suit brought by an affected teacher aide and an affected applicant for a position as a teacher aide, we held that the prohibition against the employment of unwed parents violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.  Inquiring whether the classification established by the school district\\'s policy was rationally related to a legitimate government interest, we rejected all three rationales offered in support of the contention that the rule furthered the creation of a properly moral scholastic environment: (1) that unwed parenthood is prima facie proof of immorality; (2) that unwed parents are unfit role models; (3) that employment of an unwed parent in a scholastic environment materially contributes to the problem of school-girl pregnancies.  Id. at 614.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      The appellees argue, as did the school district in Andrews, that unwed parenthood is per se proof of immorality and that a parent of an illegitimate child is an unfit role model.  The appellees offer no support for either assertion that was not before us in Andrews, nor do the appellees offer any meaningful distinction between Andrews and this case.6  Therefore, we hold that Avery\\'s discharge was in violation of her rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.  So holding, we need not reach her other claims.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      The judgment of the district court is vacated.  The case is remanded to the district court, which is instructed to determine the relief to which Avery is entitled and to enter judgment accordingly.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      VACATED and REMANDED, with instructions.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        *\\n         Former Fifth Circuit Case, Section 9(1) of Public Law 96-452-October 14, 1980\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         No distinction was made at trial or on appeal among conception, pregnancy, and delivery out of wedlock.  This case requires no such distinction, and we use the three terms interchangeably\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         As noted at p. 341, infra, we depart from the usual sequence in this case by addressing the constitutional claims before the statutory claims.  Therefore, we need not decide whether the Mt. Healthy analysis would apply to Avery\\'s claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e, et seq., 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1681, and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Conversely, Dr. French did testify that he would have recommended her discharge for immorality even if she had given timely notice of her pregnancy\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         Avery offered documentary and testimonial evidence that the Board continued to employ married teachers who tardily notified the Superintendent of their pregnancies.  That evidence, however, was somewhat equivocal, and we do not consider it in reaching our decision\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         Although we do not customarily make such factual findings, our authority to do so on a record permitting only one factual inference is clear.  See, e.g., Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 71-72, 88 S.Ct. 709, 715, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968); Levin v. Mississippi River Fuel Corp., 386 U.S. 162, 170, 87 S.Ct. 927, 932, 17 L.Ed.2d 834 (1967); Felder v. United States, 543 F.2d 657, 671 (9th Cir. 1976)\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         One reason for our conclusion in Andrews that the first rationale offered by the school district was unconstitutional was that unwed parents were denied a due process hearing to which employees charged with other immoral conduct were entitled.  Id. at 616.  Avery was not denied a hearing.  The equal protection component of the Andrews analysis is nonetheless applicable here.  Furthermore, the discussion of due process in Andrews was dictum, since the holding of the case was that the school district\\'s policy created an irrational classification and therefore violated the equal protection clause.

The district court enjoined the enforcement of an administrative order against Hydrostorage, concluding that such enforcement was preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a), and by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 151 et seq.

We affirm.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      * This case arises out of California\\'s efforts to regulate apprenticeship on public works projects.   California\\'s general administrative framework for regulating apprenticeships is complex.   The California Apprenticeship Council (Council) is a six-member entity created by state statute and empowered to issue rules and regulations establishing minimum standards of wages, hours, and working conditions for apprentices.   Cal. Labor Code &#167;&#167; 3070, 3071 (West Supp.1989).   The Council is located in the Division of Apprenticeship Standards (Division), which in turn is part of California\\'s Department of Industrial Relations.   Id.  The Director of Industrial Relations serves as the Administrator of Apprenticeship (Administrator), in which capacity he or his delegees carry out such duties as investigating and determining charges of alleged violations of the terms of apprenticeship agreements.   Cal. Labor Code &#167;&#167; 3072, 3081 (1971);  8 Cal.Code Reg. &#167; 202 (1988).   A determination by the Administrator may be appealed to the Council.   Cal. Labor Code &#167; 3082 (West Supp.1989);  8 Cal.Code Reg. &#167; 203 (1988).\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      The Division approves written apprenticeship standards which are submitted to it, if those standards conform to the Council\\'s minimum requirements.   Cal. Labor Code &#167; 3073 (West Supp.1989);  8 Cal.Code Reg. &#167; 212 (1988).   Standards of apprenticeship may be submitted for approval by any \"apprenticeship program sponsor,\" which includes joint apprenticeship committees, unilateral labor or management apprenticeship committees, or individual employers.   Cal. Labor Code &#167; 3075 (West Supp.1989).   For the craft of boilermaker, the Council in May 1974 approved a set of apprenticeship standards contained in a document entitled \"Boilermakers Standards of Apprenticeship for Field Construction and Repair in Eight Western States Area\" (Standards).   Subsequent to 1974, the Standards were amended to implement an equal employment opportunity program approved by the Division.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      An employer in California may gain the right and responsibility to train Boilermaker apprentices in either of two ways.   Employers who are signatory to the collective bargaining agreement with the relevant union--the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Shipbuilders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers (Union)--become bound to the Standards by virtue of a clause in the collective bargaining agreement which so stipulates.   On the other hand, employers who are not parties to the collective bargaining agreement (such as non-union contractors or contractors signatory to some other collective bargaining agreement) must apply to a local joint apprenticeship committee for approval to train on public works projects in accordance with the Standards.   Cal. Labor Code &#167; 1777.5 (West Supp.1989);  8 Cal.Code Reg. &#167; 229 (1988).   Contractors approved to train by the joint apprenticeship committee are sent a certificate of approval.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Hydrostorage, a Tennessee corporation, is not a signatory to the Union\\'s collective bargaining agreement.   Hydrostorage is a contractor engaged in the construction of water storage facilities.   Much of Hydrostorage\\'s work consists of public works projects.   In the fall of 1986, Hydrostorage was awarded a public works contract to construct a water storage tank for the Lathrop County Water District in Lathrop, California (Lathrop project).\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      The State of California imposes certain conditions relating to apprentices upon contractors and subcontractors who perform contracts awarded by the state or its political subdivisions.   See Cal.  Labor Code &#167; 1777.5 (West Supp.1989).1  Under section 1777.5 of the California Labor Code, contractors, with certain exceptions not relevant to this case, must (1) \"apply to the joint apprenticeship committee administering the apprenticeship standards of the craft or trade in the area of the site of the public work for a certificate approving the contractor or subcontractor under the apprenticeship standards for the employment and training of apprentices in the area or industry affected\";  (2) employ apprentices in a ratio of no less than one apprentice for every five journeymen;  and (3) \"contribute to the fund or funds in each craft or trade in which [the contractor] employs journeymen or apprentices on the public work in the same amount or upon the same basis and in the same manner as the other contractors do.\"   Id.  As for the contribution requirement, if apprenticeship \"trust fund administrators are unable to accept [the] funds, contractors not signatory to the trust agreement\" must pay \"a like amount to the California Apprenticeship Council.\"   Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      The Northern California Boilermakers Local Joint Apprenticeship Committee (Committee) administers the approved apprenticeship standards for the boilermaker craft in the Lathrop area.   The Committee is composed of equal numbers of persons appointed by labor and management.   See Cal.  Labor Code &#167; 3075 (West Supp.1989).\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      For willful noncompliance with section 1777.5\\'s requirements, a contractor is subject to civil penalties and debarment from bidding on public works contracts for one year.   Id. &#167; 1777.7.   The parties do not dispute that section 1777.5 applies to the Lathrop project, or that Hydrostorage neither applied to the Committee for a certificate of approval nor employed any apprentices on the project.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      On September 25, 1986, the Committee filed a complaint regarding the Lathrop project with the Division.   The Division investigated the allegations and issued an administrative complaint against Hydrostorage on January 26, 1987.   The administrative complaint alleged that Hydrostorage had violated section 1777.5 by failing to (1) apply for permission to employ and train apprentices, (2) make timely contributions to the apprenticeship trust fund, and (3) employ apprentices in the legally required ratio.   The complaint was scheduled to be heard before a hearing officer on May 14, 1987.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      On May 13, one day before the administrative hearing was scheduled to take place, Hydrostorage filed an action in federal court, seeking a declaration that section 1777.5 was preempted by ERISA and the NLRA.   Hydrostorage also sought a preliminary injunction against the administrative proceedings.   At a hearing on May 13, 1987, the district judge refused to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the administrative hearing.   The administrative hearing took place as scheduled on the following day.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      After various motions were filed in the federal action, the district court entered an order of abstention on September 25, 1987, based upon the existence of pending state judicial or administrative proceedings.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Two days later, on September 27, 1987, the administrative determination was issued.   The Director of the Division found that Hydrostorage had willfully violated section 1777.5 \"by failing to apply to the [Committee] for approval to train apprentices in the Lathrop Project [and] by failing to employ the mandatory ratio of apprentices to journeymen on the Lathrop project.\"   The Director ordered Hydrostorage barred from bidding on public works contracts for one year and assessed a civil penalty.   Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Although the administrative complaint had alleged that Hydrostorage had violated section 1777.5 by \"fail[ing] to make timely contributions to the training fund or the California Apprenticeship Council,\" the Division found no willful violation of this charge.   Instead, the Division regarded Hydrostorage\\'s contributions to the Council, a state agency, as sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirement.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Hydrostorage filed a timely administrative appeal of the determination to the Council\\'s Appeal Board.   See id. &#167; 3082.   The Council issued its decision on January 28, 1988, reversing the administrator\\'s determination that Hydrostorage had willfully failed to train apprentices in the required ratio, but affirmed the determination that Hydrostorage had willfully failed to apply for approval to train apprentices.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      Hydrostorage then returned to federal district court.   On March 3, 1988, Hydrostorage filed an amended complaint in its original action and again sought a TRO, this time to prevent the Council\\'s decision from being enforced.   Hydrostorage also filed a second federal action alleging virtually identical claims and asserting subject matter jurisdiction under both diversity and federal question statutes.   In the second action, Hydrostorage sought an injunction as well as a writ of mandate pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure &#167; 1094.5, which permits review in state court of final administrative orders.   See Cal.  Civil Proc.Code &#167; 1094.5 (West Supp.1989).\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      A hearing on the TRO application was held on March 3, 1988, before the district judge presiding over Hydrostorage\\'s original action.   The judge denied Hydrostorage\\'s request for a TRO, stayed the effect of the Council\\'s administrative order, ordered Hydrostorage\\'s two actions consolidated, and scheduled a hearing on Hydrostorage\\'s motion for summary judgment for April 15.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      After the hearing, on May 4, 1988, the district court, in a published opinion and order, granted Hydrostorage\\'s motion for summary judgment in the consolidated cases.  Hydrostorage, Inc. v. Northern California Boilermakers Local Joint Apprenticeship Committee, 685 F. Supp. 718 (N.D.Cal.1988).   The court\\'s ruling was based on two independent grounds:  the administrative order was preempted both by ERISA and by the NLRA.  Id. at 720-25.   The court was careful not to rule on whether section 1777.5 was preempted by either ERISA or the NLRA.   See id. at 723 (\"The Court has not been asked to strike down &#167; 1777.5 nor does it do so by this order which holds only that as applied in this case it is preempted by ERISA.\")  (emphasis added);  id. at 725 (\"Because application of the [administrative] determination and order would in this case have th[e] effect [of requiring Hydrostorage to become a party to a collective bargaining agreement], it is barred by the NLRA....\").  From this summary judgment, the Committee, Division, and Council filed separate timely appeals, which were consolidated.\\n    \\n    II\\n    \\n      18\\n      Boilermakers first argue that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.   This issue presents a question of law which we review de novo.  Guadamuz v. Bowen, 859 F.2d 762, 766 (9th Cir.1988).\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      The district court did not explain why it had subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331, but merely cited footnote 14 of Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 103 S. Ct. 2890, 77 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1983) (Shaw ).  685 F. Supp. at 719.  Shaw involved a challenge to two New York statutes governing pregnancy benefits on the grounds that they were preempted by ERISA.  Shaw, 463 U.S. at 88, 103 S.Ct. at 2895.   Plaintiffs were employers who maintained ERISA employee benefit plans which provided certain medical and disability benefits.  Id. at 92, 103 S.Ct. at 2897.   In a footnote, the Court explained:\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      The Court\\'s decision today in Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust [463 U.S. 1, 103 S. Ct. 2841, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1983) ], does not call into question the lower courts\\' jurisdiction to decide these cases.  Franchise Tax Board was an action seeking a declaration that state laws were not pre-empted by ERISA.   Here, in contrast, companies subject to ERISA regulation seek injunctions against enforcement of state laws they claim are pre-empted by ERISA, as well as declarations that those laws are pre-empted.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      It is beyond dispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal rights.   See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 160-62 [28 S. Ct. 441, 454-55, 52 L. Ed. 714] (1908).   A plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation, on the ground that such regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, must prevail, thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 to resolve.   This Court, of course, frequently has resolved pre-emption disputes in a similar jurisdictional posture.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      Id. at 96 n. 14, 103 S. Ct. at 2899 n. 14 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      The Council attempts to distinguish Shaw by arguing that unlike the plaintiffs there, Hydrostorage is not an \"employer\" within the meaning of ERISA.   See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(5) (defining \"employer\" for ERISA purposes as \"any person acting directly as an employer, or indirectly in the interest of an employer, in relation to an employee benefit plan\").   This argument suggests that footnote 14 distinguishes Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 103 S. Ct. 2841, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1983), as turning on the presence in Shaw of \"companies subject to ERISA regulation.\"  Shaw, 463 U.S. at 96 n. 14, 103 S. Ct. at 2899 n. 14.   The Council further argues that because Hydrostorage is not an \"employer\" under ERISA, it cannot state a claim under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a), which authorizes various persons to bring civil actions for ERISA violations.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a) (authorizing actions to enforce ERISA by Secretary of Labor, and by participants, fiduciaries, or beneficiaries of ERISA trusts);  see also Fentron Industries, Inc. v. National Shopmen Pension Fund, 674 F.2d 1300, 1305 &amp; n. 6 (9th Cir.1982) (employers may also sue under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132).   Nor, according to the Council, is Hydrostorage either a \"participant\" or a \"beneficiary\" of an ERISA fund, as those terms are defined by statute.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(2)(B)(7) &amp; (8).   Thus, argues the Council, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      The Council misconceives the nature of this action and the meaning of the Shaw footnote.   This is not an action brought directly under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a).   It is an action for injunctive and declaratory relief from state regulation based on federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331.   See New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. New Orleans, 782 F.2d 1236, 1240-41 (5th Cir.)  (New Orleans), amended, 798 F.2d 858 (1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 1910, 95 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1987).   As the Court in Shaw asserted, \"[a] plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation, on the ground that such regulation is preempted by a federal statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, must prevail, ... presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 to resolve.\"  463 U.S. at 96 n. 14, 103 S. Ct. at 2899 n. 14 (emphasis added);   see also Lawrence County v. Lead-Deadwood School District No. 40-1, 469 U.S. 256, 259 n. 6, 105 S. Ct. 695, 697 n. 6, 83 L. Ed. 2d 635 (1985).   This rule has been applied in numerous cases in this and other circuits.   See, e.g., Martori Brothers Distributors v. James-Massengale, 781 F.2d 1349, 1353 (9th Cir.)  (Martori ), amended, 791 F.2d 799, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 949, 107 S. Ct. 435, 93 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1986);   Southern Pacific Transportation Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 716 F.2d 1285, 1288 (9th Cir.1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 936, 104 S. Ct. 1908, 80 L. Ed. 2d 457 (1984);   Colonial Penn Group, Inc. v. Colonial Deposit Co., 834 F.2d 229, 236-37 (1st Cir.1987);   New Orleans, 782 F.2d at 1240-41;   Aluminum Co. of America v. Utilities Commission of North Carolina, 713 F.2d 1024, 1028 (4th Cir.1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1052, 104 S. Ct. 1326, 79 L. Ed. 2d 722 (1984);   Pacific Merchant Shipping Association v. Aubry, 709 F. Supp. 1516, 1521-22 (C.D.Cal.1989).   Here, Hydrostorage is seeking, among other remedies, injunctive relief from state regulation, arguing that the underlying state statutes are preempted under the supremacy clause by ERISA.   In a case such as this, the supremacy clause and the federal statute provide subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331.   We conclude that the district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331.\\n    \\n    III\\n    \\n      25\\n      The Council next argues that the district court should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction under either the Pullman or Younger abstention doctrines.   The Council argues that this court \"has the authority to apply the doctrine of abstention regardless of whether the issue was raised before the District Court or even before this Court.\"   We agree.   See Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U.S. 132, 143-44 n. 10, 96 S. Ct. 2857, 2864-65 n. 10, 49 L. Ed. 2d 844 (1976) (abstention may be properly raised sua sponte );  Richardson v. Koshiba, 693 F.2d 911, 915 (9th Cir.1982) (though neither party briefed issue of Pullman abstention, panel raised it at oral argument and disposed of case on this ground).   But we are not required to do so since it does not implicate our subject matter jurisdiction.   See Ohio Bureau of Employment Services v. Hodory, 431 U.S. 471, 479-80, 97 S. Ct. 1898, 1903-04, 52 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1977);  Universal Amusement Co. v. Vance, 587 F.2d 159, 163 n. 6 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc) (\"Appellant did not raise the question of Younger abstention [on appeal], and that issue, being nonjurisdictional, is thus not before this court.\"), aff\\'d, 445 U.S. 308, 100 S. Ct. 1156, 63 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1980) (per curiam);  Schachter v. Whalen, 581 F.2d 35, 36 n. 1 (2d Cir.1978) (\"Younger abstention goes to the exercise of equity jurisdiction, not to the jurisdiction of the federal district court as such to hear the case.\").\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Although the district court abstained under Younger pending completion of the state administrative proceedings, it heard and decided Hydrostorage\\'s motion for summary judgment after the Council\\'s decision was rendered.   None of the appellants argued in the district court for abstention under Younger or Pullman after the Council decided Hydrostorage\\'s administrative appeal.   Under these circumstances, when the district court did not consider the issue, we decline to address abstention on appeal.   See Greater Los Angeles Council on Deafness, Inc. v. Zolin, 812 F.2d 1103, 1115-16 n. 19 (9th Cir.1987) (since party did not raise abstention issues in trial court, appellate court need not consider them on appeal).\\n    \\n    IV\\n    \\n      27\\n      Boilermakers next argue that the district court erred in concluding that ERISA preempts the administrative order in this case.   We review a summary judgment de novo.  Rutledge v. Arizona Board of Regents, 859 F.2d 732, 734 (9th Cir.1988);  General Motors Corp. v. California State Board of Equalization, 815 F.2d 1305, 1309 (9th Cir.1987) (summary judgment based on ERISA-preemption reviewed de novo), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 941, 108 S. Ct. 1122, 99 L. Ed. 2d 282 (1988).   Because there are no contested issues of fact, we need decide only whether the substantive law was applied correctly.  Martori, 781 F.2d at 1351.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      ERISA is a \"comprehensive remedial statute \\'designed to protect the interest of employees in pension and welfare plans, and to protect employers from conflicting and inconsistent state and local regulation of such plans.\\' \"  Local Union 598, Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters Industry Journeymen &amp; Apprentices Training Fund v. J.A. Jones Construction Co., 846 F.2d 1213, 1217 (9th Cir.)  (Jones ), aff\\'d, --- U.S. ----, 109 S. Ct. 210, 102 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1988), quoting Scott v. Gulf Oil Corp., 754 F.2d 1499, 1501 (9th Cir.1985).   The statute \"sets forth reporting and disclosure obligations for plans, imposes a fiduciary standard of care for plan administrators, and establishes schedules for the vesting and accrual of pension benefits.\"  Massachusetts v. Morash, --- U.S. ----, 109 S. Ct. 1668, 1671-72, 104 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1989) (Morash ).\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      ERISA governs \"employee benefit plans,\" which are statutorily defined as plans that are either an \"employee welfare benefit plan,\" an \"employee pension benefit plan,\" or both.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(3);  Morash, 109 S. Ct. at 1672.   The statute defines \"employee welfare benefit plan\" as follows:\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      any plan, fund, or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization, or by both, to the extent that such plan, fund, or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries, through the purchase of insurance or otherwise, (A) medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, death or unemployment, or vacation benefits, apprenticeship or other training programs, or day care centers, scholarship funds, or prepaid legal services....\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(1) (emphasis added).\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      ERISA contains a very broad preemption clause.   Section 514(a) of ERISA, as codified at 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a), provides that ERISA \"shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in section 1003(a) of this title....\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a) (emphasis added).  \"State laws\" are defined as \"all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law, of any State.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(c)(1).   A \"state\" is defined as \"a State, any political subdivisions thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of either, which purports to regulate, directly or indirectly, the terms and conditions of employee benefit plans covered by this subchapter.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(c)(2).\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      Several exceptions exist to ERISA\\'s broad preemption clause.   Only one such exception is relevant to this case, however:  ERISA\\'s so-called \"savings clause.\"   Section 514(d) of ERISA, codified at 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(d), provides that \"[n]othing in this subchapter shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States ... or any rule or regulation issued under any such law.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(d).\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      Applying these statutory provisions, the district court held that the Council\\'s order was preempted by ERISA.  685 F. Supp. at 723.   The district court first reasoned that \"the Apprenticeship Program under the Boilermakers collective bargaining agreement\" constituted an ERISA employee welfare benefit plan.  Id. at 721.   Next, the court determined that the administrative order against Hydrostorage was preempted under section 514(a), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a).   Id.  Finally, the court held that the administrative order was not saved by section 514(d), ERISA\\'s savings clause.  Id. at 723.\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      On appeal, Boilermakers have challenged each of these three steps in the district court\\'s analysis.   We address them in turn.\\n    \\n    A.\\n    \\n      36\\n      We first consider whether this case involves an \"employee benefit plan,\" a necessary predicate for the applicability of ERISA.   The parties do not contend that any \"employee pension benefit plan\" is involved here.   Instead, they properly focus on whether there is an \"employee welfare benefit plan.\"   To answer this question, we must consider whether this case involves a \"plan, fund, or program ... established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization, or by both, ... for the purpose of providing for its participants ... apprenticeship or other training programs.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(1) (emphasis added).\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      ERISA does not define the terms \"plan,\" \"fund,\" \"program,\" or \"apprenticeship training program.\"   See Morash, 109 S. Ct. at 1672.   Regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under authority delegated by statute similarly fail to define these terms.   See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2510.3-1 (1988);  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1135.   Moreover, of the very few reported decisions involving ERISA and apprenticeship funds or programs, none defines or analyzes the term \"apprenticeship training program.\"   In the absence of such guidance, we \"must give effect to [the statute\\'s] plain language unless there is good reason to believe Congress intended the language to have some more restrictive meaning.\"  Shaw, 463 U.S. at 97, 103 S.Ct. at 2900;  see also id. at 97 n. 16, 103 S. Ct. at 2900 n. 16 (quoting Black\\'s Law Dictionary definitions in determining the meaning of phrase \"relates to\" in ERISA\\'s preemption clause).\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      The district court applied the plain meaning of the statute.   In explaining why this case involved an employee welfare benefit plan, the district court wrote:\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      There can be no question that the Apprenticeship Program under the Boilermakers collective bargaining agreement falls within the literal scope of [29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(1)\\'s] definition.   It comprises a plan, fund, and program maintained by employers and the bargaining representative of their employees to provide its participants with apprenticeship training.   That the Apprenticeship Fund itself may also be governed to an extent by other federal laws, as [the Division] argues, in no way takes the Apprenticeship Program out of the statutory definition.\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      685 F.Supp. at 721 (footnote omitted).   It is unclear to us precisely what the district court meant by the \"Apprenticeship Program.\"   This term conceivably could encompass the apprenticeship trust fund, the Standards, and even the Committee.\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      A \"fund\" has been defined as \"[a]n asset or group of assets set aside for a specific purpose,\" or \"[a] sum of money or other liquid assets set apart for a specific purpose, or available for the payment of debts or claims.\"   Black\\'s Law Dictionary 606 (5th ed. 1979).   A \"plan\" has been described as \"a method of design or action, procedure, or arrangement for accomplishment of a particular act or object.  [A] [m]ethod of putting into effect an intention or proposal.\"   Id. at 1036 (citation omitted).   Although Black\\'s Law Dictionary does not supply a definition of \"program,\" another prominent dictionary defines a program as a \"plan of procedure,\" \"schedule or system under which action may be taken toward a desired goal,\" or \"proposed project or scheme.\"   Webster\\'s Third New International Dictionary 1812 (1971).\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      We recently held that an apprenticeship training fund is an employee welfare benefit plan under ERISA.  Jones, 846 F.2d at 1217 (\"Since the [local apprenticeship fund] is established to provide \\'apprenticeship or other training programs,\\' it is an \\'employee welfare benefit plan\\' within the meaning of ERISA.\").   The parties agree that the Boilermakers\\' apprenticeship trust fund (Fund) qualifies as an ERISA employee benefit plan.\\n    \\n    \\n      43\\n      A more difficult question is whether the Standards constitute an \"employee welfare benefit plan,\" i.e., a \"plan\" or \"program\" which was \"established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization, or by both, ... for the purpose of providing for its participants ... apprenticeship or other training programs.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(1).   We conclude that the Standards satisfy this definition.   The Standards consist of a detailed, 16-page document which specifies the duties and procedure of the Committee, the minimum qualifications of apprentices, the maximum ratio of apprentices to journeymen on job locations, the terms and conditions of apprenticeships, and the hours and wages of apprentices.   The Standards also provide for supplemental instruction as well as periodic examination of apprentices.   The Standards clearly embody \"a method of design or action, procedure, or arrangement for accomplishment of a particular ... object,\" in this case the training of apprentices.   Black\\'s Law Dictionary 1036 (5th ed.1979).   In addition, there is no question that the Standards were established \"for the purpose of providing for its participants ... apprenticeship or other training programs.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(1).   The Standards\\'s stated purpose is \"the training of Boilermakers, skilled in all phases of the erection and repair industry, who will be a credit to the industry.\"   Finally, the Standards were established by the Committee, an entity created by the collective bargaining agreement and composed of equal numbers of representatives of labor and management.   As such, the Committee qualifies as \"an employer or ... employee organization, or ... both.\"   Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      44\\n      The Standards are an integral part of a larger \"program\" established for the purpose of providing \"apprenticeship ... training.\"   Id.  Thus, both the Fund and the Standards fall within the definition of an \"employee welfare benefit plan\" under ERISA.\\n    \\n    \\n      45\\n      We need not decide whether the Committee itself, whose functions include the formulation and administration of the Standards, is also part of the employee welfare benefit plan.   The Division strenuously argues that while the Fund is an ERISA plan, the Committee is not.   The resolution of this issue has no bearing on our decision.   Since the Standards and Fund constitute an ERISA plan, this case clearly falls within the coverage of ERISA.\\n    \\n    \\n      46\\n      The Division argues, however, that we should eschew a literal interpretation of ERISA\\'s definition and defer instead to Congress\\'s broader purpose behind the statute.   While the Supreme Court has recognized that various provisions in ERISA are \" \\'perhaps ... not a model of legislative drafting,\\' \" Pilot Life Insurance Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 46, 107 S. Ct. 1549, 1552, 95 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1987) (Pilot Life) (referring to preemption and insurance savings clauses), quoting Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U.S. 724, 739, 105 S. Ct. 2380, 2388, 85 L. Ed. 2d 728 (1985) (Metropolitan Life ), and that in particular the term \"employee benefit plan\" is \"defined only tautologically in the statute,\" Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 8, 107 S. Ct. 2211, 2216, 96 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1987) (Coyne ), it also frequently has looked to the plain meaning of statutory language.   See id. at 7-8, 107 S.Ct. at 2215-2216;  Metropolitan Life, 471 U.S. at 740, 105 S.Ct. at 2389;  Shaw, 463 U.S. at 97 &amp; n. 16, 103 S. Ct. at 2900 &amp; n. 16.   In addition, the Division acknowledges that ERISA\\'s legislative history fails to address what \"plan, fund or program\" means in the context of apprenticeship training programs.   Perhaps the reason for this is that Congress, in enacting ERISA, focused on the regulation of employee pension benefit plans and spent little time considering employee welfare benefit plans.   See Brummond, Federal Preemption of State Insurance Regulation Under ERISA, 62 Iowa L.Rev. 57, 113-22 (1976).\\n    \\n    \\n      47\\n      The Division\\'s argument is essentially one for statutory revision and is properly directed to the Legislative Branch.   See Shaw, 463 U.S. at 106, 103 S.Ct. at 2904 (\"To the extent that our construction of ERISA causes any problems in the administration of state fair employment laws, those problems are the result of congressional choice and should be addressed by congressional action.\").   The statute is clear on its face.   Our commission is to follow its precepts.   We are not allowed to amend the statute through the Division\\'s suggested interpretation.   We conclude that the Standards and Fund are an ERISA plan.\\n    \\n    B.\\n    \\n      48\\n      We must next consider whether the Council\\'s order falls under ERISA\\'s preemption clause, which preempts \"any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a).   In recent years, the Supreme Court has examined the scope of ERISA preemption on numerous occasions.   See, e.g., Morash, 109 S. Ct. 1668;  Mackey v. Lanier Collections Agency &amp; Service, 486 U.S. 825, 108 S. Ct. 2182, 100 L. Ed. 2d 836 (1988) (Mackey );  Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 107 S. Ct. 2211;  Pilot Life, 481 U.S. 41, 107 S. Ct. 1549;  Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 107 S. Ct. 1542, 95 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1987);  Metropolitan Life, 471 U.S. 724, 105 S. Ct. 2380;  Shaw, 463 U.S. 85, 103 S. Ct. 2890;  Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U.S. 504, 101 S. Ct. 1895, 68 L. Ed. 2d 402 (1981) (Alessi ).   The Court has stated that \"the express preemption provisions of ERISA are deliberately expansive, and designed to \\'establish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern.\\' \"  Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 45-46, 107 S.Ct. at 1551-52, quoting Alessi, 451 U.S. at 523, 101 S.Ct. at 1906.\\n    \\n    \\n      49\\n      There is no question that the Council\\'s administrative order against Hydrostorage constitutes a \"state law\" within the meaning of ERISA.   See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(c)(1) (defining \"state laws\" as \"all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law, of any State\").   The Council\\'s order has the effect of law in California.   Furthermore, the Council comes within ERISA\\'s definition of a \"state\" because it is included within \"a State, any political subdivisions thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of either, which purports to regulate, directly or indirectly, the terms and conditions of employee benefit plans covered by this subchapter.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(c)(2).\\n    \\n    \\n      50\\n      More difficult is the issue of whether the administrative order \"relates to\" an ERISA employee benefit plan.   We have required that a state law both \"relate to,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a), and \"purport[ ] to regulate, directly or indirectly,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(c), an employee welfare benefit plan in order for it to be preempted.  Jones, 846 F.2d at 1218;  Martori, 781 F.2d at 1356.  \" \\'A law \"relates to\" an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\\' \"  Shaw, 463 U.S. at 96-97, 103 S.Ct. at 2899-900.   A law purports to regulate a plan if it attempts to reach in one way or another the terms and conditions of employee benefit plans.  Jones, 846 F.2d at 1218;  Lane v. Goren, 743 F.2d 1337, 1339 (9th Cir.1984).\\n    \\n    \\n      51\\n      Boilermakers argue that section 1777.5 does not \"relate to\" or \"purport to regulate\" an ERISA plan.   The district court reasoned that the Council\\'s order \"relates to\" an ERISA plan because it \"compel[s] Hydrostorage to participate in and contribute to the Boilermakers Apprenticeship Program\" and because section 1777.5, upon which the order was based, \"establishes the manner in which contractors must participate in the Apprenticeship Program and fund its costs.\"  685 F. Supp. at 721.   As for our additional requirement that the challenged state law \"purport[ ] to regulate, directly or indirectly\" an ERISA plan, the district court concluded that \"there can be no question but that &#167; 1777.5 regulates apprenticeship program[s].\"  Id. at 721 n. 6.   Although we disagree with some of the district court\\'s reasoning, we agree with its conclusion that the administrative order against Hydrostorage falls under ERISA\\'s preemption clause.\\n    \\n    \\n      52\\n      First, the order clearly \"relates to\" the Standards, which are part of an ERISA plan.   Hydrostorage was sanctioned for failing to apply to the Committee for permission to train apprentices on the Lathrop project.   The very purpose of requiring Hydrostorage to apply was so that Hydrostorage would become bound by the Standards, an ERISA plan.   Hydrostorage would have been required to sign a DAS-7 form entitled \"Agreement to Train Apprentices.\"   By signing a DAS-7 form, Hydrostorage would agree \"to train apprentices in the designated occupation in accordance with the apprenticeship standards and apprenticeship agreement and to comply with the provisions thereof.\"   The \"apprenticeship standards\" in this case are the Standards, an ERISA plan.   Thus, the order undoubtedly \"relates to\" an ERISA plan in the sense that the order has a \"connection with or reference to\" the Standards.\\n    \\n    \\n      53\\n      Second, we conclude that the administrative order \"purports to regulate, indirectly or directly,\" an ERISA plan.   Again, the order\\'s purpose is to require Hydrostorage and other contractors on public works projects to become bound by the Standards, an ERISA plan.   See Metropolitan Life, 471 U.S. at 739, 105 S.Ct. at 2388 (Massachusetts law requiring ERISA plans to provide minimum coverage for mental health care expenses \"bears indirectly but substantially\" on plans since \"it requires them to purchase the mental-health benefits specified in the statute\").   The order is designed to enforce the terms of an ERISA plan.   The same is true of the statute upon which the order was based, California Labor Code &#167; 1777.5.   Section 1777.5 is aimed at enforcing the terms of an ERISA plan, the Standards, and compelling nonsignatory contractors to join or comply with such plans.   The underlying statute is therefore one which is specifically designed to affect employee benefit plans.   See Mackey, 108 S. Ct. at 2185 (\"[W]e have virtually taken it for granted that state laws which are specifically designed to affect employee benefit plans are preempted under &#167; 514(a).\")  (citations and internal quotations omitted).   We therefore conclude that the administrative order falls within ERISA\\'s preemption clause.\\n    \\n    \\n      54\\n      The Committee argues, however, that section 1777.5 does not \"purport to regulate\" because it \"applies only when the state is purchasing services in the marketplace, and simply expresses a decision as to the terms upon which the state chooses to do business.\"   In essence, the Committee argues that California is acting as a \"marketplace participant,\" not a regulator.   The Committee relies on a series of dormant commerce clause cases which discuss the market participant theory.\\n    \\n    \\n      55\\n      There are two reasons why we reject the Committee\\'s \"market participant\" argument.   First, as the Supreme Court observed in rejecting a similar argument in a case involving NLRA preemption, Wisconsin Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations v. Gould, 475 U.S. 282, 106 S. Ct. 1057, 89 L. Ed. 2d 223 (1986), \"the \\'market participant\\' doctrine reflects the particular concerns underlying the Commerce Clause, not any general notion regarding the necessary extent of state power in areas where Congress has acted.\"  Id. at 289, 106 S.Ct. at 1062;  see also id. at 290, 106 S.Ct. at 1063 (\"What the Commerce Clause would permit States to do in the absence of the NLRA is ... an entirely different question from what States may do with the Act in place.\").   Second, California in this case is not acting merely as a \"market participant\" rather than a regulator.   The state\\'s involvement does not end with the awarding of the contract.   Section 1777.5 is aimed at regulating contractors who work on public contracts.   The Division, part of a state agency, monitors and enforces violations of section 1777.5.   This amounts to regulation, not merely \"market participation.\"\\n    \\n    C.\\n    \\n      56\\n      Finally, Boilermakers argue that section 1777.5 is saved from preemption by section 514(d) of ERISA, codified at 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(d), which provides that \"[n]othing in this subchapter shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States ... or any rule or regulation issued under any such law.\"   Boilermakers argue that the administrative order is saved in light of the Fitzgerald Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 50 et seq., which provides:\\n    \\n    \\n      57\\n      The Secretary of Labor is authorized and directed to formulate and promote the furtherance of labor standards necessary to safeguard the welfare of apprentices, to extend the application of such standards by encouraging the inclusion thereof in contracts of apprenticeship, to bring together employers and labor for the formulation of programs of apprenticeship, to cooperate with State agencies engaged in the formulation and promotion of standards of apprenticeship....\\n    \\n    \\n      58\\n      29 U.S.C. &#167; 50.   These apprenticeship standards are set forth at 29 C.F.R. &#167; 29.1-29.13 (1988).   The regulations provide \"a detailed regulatory scheme defining apprenticeship programs and their requirements, and establish a review, approval, and registration process for proposed apprenticeship programs administered by State Apprenticeship Councils under the aegis of the United States Department of Labor.\"  Siuslaw Concrete Construction Co. v. Washington, Department of Transportation, 784 F.2d 952, 956 (9th Cir.1986).\\n    \\n    \\n      59\\n      Boilermakers argue that section 514(d), which saves \"any rule or regulation issued under any [law of the United States],\" saves section 1777.5 from preemption because section 1777.5 promotes and encourages the spread of approved apprenticeship programs established under the auspices of the Fitzgerald Act and the regulations of the Secretary of Labor.\\n    \\n    \\n      60\\n      The district judge addressed Boilermakers\\' argument at length, see 685 F. Supp. at 721-23, concluding that \"[b]y no stretch of the imagination could &#167; 1777.5 be considered a state law the preemption of which would impair federal law.\"  Id. at 722.   The court reasoned:\\n    \\n    \\n      61\\n      The Fitzgerald Act merely directs the Secretary of Labor \"to formulate and promote the furtherance of labor standards ... to safeguard the welfare of apprentices\" and related objectives.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 50.   The implementing regulations state that their purpose is \"to set forth labor standards to safeguard the welfare of apprentices, and to extend the application of such standards by prescribing policies and procedures concerning the registration, for certain Federal purposes, [of] acceptable apprenticeship programs.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 29.1(b).   Thus the regulations relate only to eligibility for federal registration.   Neither they nor the Act itself contemplate enforcement mechanisms;  Section 29.11 merely provides for the voluntary adjustment of complaints before either federal or state agencies.   Assuming &#167; 1777.5 was adopted in furtherance of the objectives of the Fitzgerald Act, it clearly is not an enforcement mechanism of federal law and to the extent orders under this section are preempted by ERISA, federal law is not impaired.\\n    \\n    \\n      62\\n      Id.  We adopt the district court\\'s reasoning.\\n    \\n    \\n      63\\n      As they did in the district court, Boilermakers seek to invoke the Supreme Court\\'s decision in Shaw to support their claim that section 514(d) saves the administrative order and California Labor Code &#167; 1777.5 from preemption.   In Shaw, appellants argued that section 514(d) saved a New York human rights law which forbid discrimination in employee benefit plans on the basis of pregnancy.  463 U.S. at 100-06, 103 S.Ct. at 2901-04.   Appellants in Shaw argued that preemption of the New York statute would \"impair\" or \"modify\" Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Id. at 100-01, 103 S.Ct. at 2901-02.   The Court accepted this argument, but only insofar as the New York law prohibited employment practices that were also unlawful under Title VII.   See also id. at 103-04, 103 S.Ct. at 2903-04 (New York statute not saved to the extent that it \"prohibit[s] conduct that federal law permit[s]\" since Title VII \"in no way depends on such extensions for its enforcement\").   The Court\\'s holding in Shaw that parts of the state law were saved rested on (1) the presence in Title VII of a clause explicitly preserving nonconflicting state laws, and (2) Title VII\\'s requirement that a claimant, before filing a charge with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), first pursue available state administrative remedies. Id. at 101-02, 103 S.Ct. at 2902-03.   The Court concluded:\\n    \\n    \\n      64\\n      Given the importance of state fair employment laws to the federal enforcement scheme, preemption of the Human Rights Law would impair Title VII to the extent that the Human Rights Law provides a means of enforcing Title VII\\'s commands.   Before the enactment of ERISA, an employee claiming discrimination in connection with a benefit plan would have had his complaint referred to the New York State Division of Human Rights.   If ERISA were interpreted to pre-empt the Human Rights Law entirely with respect to covered benefit plans, the State no longer could prohibit the challenged employment practice and the state agency no longer would be authorized to grant relief.   The EEOC thus would be unable to refer the claim to the state agency.   This would frustrate the goal of encouraging joint state\/federal enforcement of Title VII;  an employee\\'s only remedies for discrimination prohibited by Title VII in ERISA plans would be federal ones.   Such a disruption of the enforcement scheme contemplated by Title VII would, in the words of &#167; 514(d), \"modify\" and \"impair\" federal law.\\n    \\n    \\n      65\\n      Id. at 102, 103 S.Ct. at 2902 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).   The Court\\'s conclusion clearly rested upon the fact that the New York law functioned as an enforcement mechanism for Title VII.   That is simply not the case here.   The Fitzgerald Act does not articulate a \"goal of encouraging joint state\/federal enforcement.\"   Nor does the Fitzgerald Act contain any clause which preserves state laws.   See also 685 F. Supp. at 722 (rejecting attempt to rely on Shaw ).\\n    \\n    \\n      66\\n      We reject Boilermakers\\' argument that the Fitzgerald Act embodies a project in \"cooperative federalism\" which will be \"impaired\" or \"modified\" within the meaning of section 514(d) if the administrative order against Hydrostorage were preempted by ERISA.   This argument relies on an overbroad reading of Shaw and on dicta in an out-of-circuit decision.   See Rebaldo v. Cuomo, 749 F.2d 133, 139-40 (2d Cir.1984) (Van Graafeiland, J., \"writing only for himself and not his colleagues\" on issue of whether state law which panel concluded was not preempted under section 514(a) would also be saved under section 514(d), if it had been preempted), cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1008, 105 S. Ct. 2702, 86 L. Ed. 2d 718 (1985).   As the Court instructed in Shaw, ERISA\\'s structure and legislative history \"caution against applying [section 514(d) ] too expansively.\"  463 U.S. at 104, 103 S.Ct. at 2903.  \"While &#167; 514(d) may operate to exempt provisions of state law, upon which federal laws depend for their enforcement, the combination of Congress\\' enactment of an all-inclusive pre-emption provision and its enumeration of narrow, specific exceptions to that provision makes us reluctant to expand &#167; 514(d) into a more general saving clause.\"  Id.  We conclude that the Council\\'s order is not saved from preemption by section 514(d) of ERISA.   We also hold that as applied in the Council\\'s order, section 1777.5 is not saved from ERISA preemption.   However, like the district court, we do not address whether section 1777.5 in its entirety is preempted by ERISA.  685 F. Supp. at 723.\\n    \\n    \\n      67\\n      Because we affirm the district court\\'s judgment on the grounds that the Council\\'s order is preempted by ERISA, we need not reach the issue of NLRA preemption.\\n    \\n    \\n      68\\n      AFFIRMED.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        *\\n         Honorable James M.

The employment and training of each apprentice shall be in accordance with the provisions of the apprenticeship standards and apprentice agreements under which he is training.\\n        When the contractor to whom the contract is awarded by the state or any political subdivision, or any subcontractor under him, in performing any of the work under the contract or subcontract, employs workmen in any apprenticeable craft or trade, the contractor and subcontractor shall apply to the joint apprenticeship committee administering the apprenticeship standards of the craft or trade in the area of the site of the public work for a certificate approving the contractor or subcontractor under the apprenticeship standards for the employment and training of apprentices in the area or industry affected;  provided, however, that the approval as established by the joint apprenticeship committee or committees shall be subject to the approval of the Administrator of Apprenticeship.   The joint apprenticeship committee or committees, subsequent to approving the subject contractor or subcontractor, shall arrange for the dispatch of apprentices to the contractor or subcontractor in order to comply with this section.   There shall be an affirmative duty upon the joint apprenticeship committee or committees administering the apprenticeship standards of the craft or trade in the area of the site of the public work to ensure equal employment and affirmative action in apprenticeship for women and minorities.   Contractors or subcontractors shall not be required to submit individual applications for approval to local joint apprenticeship committees provided they are already covered by the local apprenticeship standards.   The ratio of apprentices to journeymen who shall be employed in the craft or trade on the public work may be the ratio stipulated in the apprenticeship standards under which the joint apprenticeship committee operates, but in no case shall the ratio be less than one apprentice for each five journeymen, except as otherwise provided in this section.\\n        The contractor or subcontractor, if he is covered by this section, upon the issuance of the approval certificate, or if he has been previously approved in such craft or trade, shall employ the number of apprentices or the ratio of apprentices to journeymen stipulated in the apprenticeship standards.   Upon proper showing by the contractor that he employs apprentices in such craft or trade in the state on all of his contracts on an annual average of not less than one apprentice to each five journeymen, the Division of Apprenticeship Standards may grant a certificate exempting the contractor from the 1-to-5 ratio as set forth in this section.   This section shall not apply to contracts of general contractors involving less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) or 20 working days or to contracts of specialty contractors not bidding for work through a general or prime contractor, involving less than two thousand dollars ($2,000) or fewer than five working days.\\n        ....\\n        A contractor to whom the contract is awarded, or any subcontractor under him, who, in performing any of the work under the contract, employs journeymen or apprentices in any apprenticeable craft or trade and who is not contributing to a fund or funds to administer and conduct the apprenticeship program in any such craft or trade in the area of the site of the public work, to which fund or funds other contractors in the area of the site of the public work are contributing, shall contribute to the fund or funds in each craft or trade in which he employs journeymen or apprentices on the public work in the same amount or upon the same basis and in the same manner as the other contractors do, but where the trust fund administrators are unable to accept such funds, contractors not signatory to the trust agreement shall pay a like amount to the California Apprenticeship Council.

She contended, inter alia, that Petro-Tex refused to promote her to payroll manager in 1969 and again in 1974 because she was a woman and that the company constructively discharged her in 1974 in retaliation for complaints she made regarding the company\\'s allegedly discriminatory treatment.  Following a bench trial, the district court entered a final judgment for Ms. Glass, awarding her $60,466.61 in back pay and ordering her reinstatement to employment.  Petro-Tex appeals.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      On appeal, Petro-Tex argues that the following findings of fact entered by the district court are clearly erroneous:  (1) that the company intentionally discriminated against Ms. Glass;  (2) that the company engaged in a \"continuing violation\" of Title VII between 1969 and 1974;  (3) that the company constructively discharged Ms. Glass in 1974;  and (4) that Ms. Glass had sufficiently mitigated her damages following the constructive discharge through her mainly unsuccessful efforts to secure other employment.  Petro-Tex further argues that the district court abused its discretion in awarding Ms. Glass $40,987.50 in attorneys\\' fees.  We find no reversible error in the district court\\'s factual findings and no abuse of discretion in its award of attorneys\\' fees.  Accordingly, we affirm.\\n    \\n    Factual Background and Proceedings Below\\n    During the relevant time (1967-1974):\\n    \\n      3\\n      The employer Petro-Tex was a manufacturer of petro-chemical products in Houston, Texas.  It employed about one thousand people.  More than half were unionized employees who received hourly wages.  The remaining some 350 employees were salaried employees, including the 50 females employed as non-supervisory office and clerical workers, with the exception of a few female accountants.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Ms. Glass, the plaintiff, was a salaried employee.  Salaried employees were governed by no formal seniority system, personnel policy, or lines of progression.  No tests for job skills were administered to evaluate employee performance.  With regards to promotions, no formal system of posting and application was followed.  Promotions were granted upon a supervisor\\'s subjective assessment and recommendations to his superior.  However, it was company policy to look within the department to make promotions from below.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Ms. Glass worked within the Treasury Department, in which decisions as to promotions and salaries were made by Harold Buchtler, the Treasurer.  Ms. Glass was hired by Petro-Tex as payroll clerk in 1967, based on eight years highly recommended service in the payroll departments of other corporations, culminating in her promotion there to chief payroll clerk.  From 1967 to 1974, when her employment with Petro-Tex terminated, Ms. Glass received merit raises uniformly, and the record reflects that, until shortly before she left Petro-Tex, she was uniformly regarded as a conscientious and well-qualified employee, who performed her responsibilities with initiative and dedication.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      This litigation arises out of the failure of Petro-Tex, through Buchtler (the Treasurer and promoting authority), to even consider Ms. Glass for promotion to Payroll Manager (or Paymaster), despite her known ambition to receive this promotion, on the three occasions in which the position fell vacant during her employment.  Ms. Glass alleged that the failure to consider her was solely because she was a female.  When she expressed this view to company superiors on the occasion of the last vacancy, she alleges (and as held by the district court) that her supervisors made her working conditions so intolerable that she resigned (i.e., was constructively discharged).\\n    \\n    The District Court\\'s Factual Findings\\n    \\n      7\\n      In its factual findings, the district court specifically fully credited Ms. Glass\\'s testimony, as corroborated by the testimony of some co-employees and some admissions in the generally unfavorable testimony of Petro-Tex witnesses, primarily managerial employees or supervisors.  The district court\\'s factual findings evidence that it did not give credit to the testimony of Petro-Tex witnesses to the contrary of its findings.\\n    \\n    The district court found:\\n    \\n      8\\n      (1) Buchtler, the Treasurer and appointing authority, was biased against women and believed they should be given no initiative.  He routinely promoted men over women.  Within the Treasury Department, no woman had ever held a supervisory or managerial post during the period of Ms. Glass\\'s employment.  Because Buchtler was sexually biased against women, he did not even consider Ms. Glass for promotion to Paymaster on the occasions of the three vacancies, although she was well qualified to receive the promotion.  On each occasion, deviating from the ordinary company policy of promoting from within, he went outside the department in order to find a male to fill the vacancy.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      (2) Moreover, on at least two of the occasions, Buchtler chose a male less qualified than Ms. Glass to fill the vacancy.  The vacancies arose and were filled as follows:\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      (a)\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Ms. Glass had been hired in early 1967 as an intermediate payroll clerk and received merit raises and a promotion to Payroll Clerk by December 1968, just before her first paymaster (Wehunt) left the company.  About a month before he departed in September 1969, she learned that a male (Pryhoda) from outside the Treasury Department was to be named as Wehunt\\'s successor.  She expressed her disappointment and inquired of Wehunt why she had been passed over, and the latter replied, \"Because they want a man.\"    Pryhoda had been an employee in the Accounting Department since 1951, had no payroll experience, and was in poor health.  During Pryhoda\\'s brief tenure, Ms. Glass had to teach him his work and, sometimes, to do his work for him.  Ultimately, on May 1, 1970, he was relieved of his duties, and he was subsequently demoted to payroll clerk.  The district court found that Pryhoda was less qualified than Ms. Glass to become the Payroll Manager.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      (b)\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Pryhoda\\'s demotion created the second vacancy.  Again reaching outside the department, despite Ms. Glass\\'s expressed interest in the promotion, Buchtler appointed as Payroll Manager on May 1, 1970 Barziza, an assistant personnel manager (1964-1970) in the Industrial Relations Department.  Barziza had served as paymaster and supervisor of payrolls in the Treasury Department from 1945-1964.  Ms. Glass acknowledges that Barziza\\'s qualifications were equal to or superior than her own, but she points out that--again--to avoid promoting her, Buchtler chose a male from outside the Department.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      (c)\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      Barziza, the new Paymaster, was planning to retire in May 1973.  Despite Ms. Glass\\'s known interest in filling the vacancy, in July 1972 Buchtler, the Treasurer, transferred Donald Weidig from the Accounting Department and had him appointed as Chief Payroll Clerk July 1, 1972, with the intention of qualifying him to succeed Barziza.  Weidig had first been employed by Petro-Tex in 1970 and had served as a property accountant until his transfer in 1972 to the Treasury Department as Chief Payroll Clerk.  Weidig had a bachelor\\'s degree in mathematics and a master\\'s degree in education, and he was a capable person.  Weidig had never applied for work in the payroll section, and he had no experience doing that work.  Although holding a higher title and paid more than Ms. Glass, Weidig performed the same duties as she did, learning them on the job.  When Barziza retired from the position, Weidig became the Payroll Manager on May 1, 1974.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Based on Ms. Glass\\'s 15 years as an experienced and highly commended payroll clerk, as compared with Weidig\\'s two-years\\' (partly as an apprentice-learner) and his training and experience in other fields only, the district court concluded that Weidig was less qualified to receive the appointment than was Ms. Glass.  While we may have some question as to this particular conclusion, we nevertheless, ultimately affirm, as not clearly erroneous, the district court\\'s finding that this reason given for the promotion of Weidig (his alleged superior qualifications1) over Ms. Glass was pretextual and that, instead, the primary reason for Weidig\\'s transfer to Treasury and his promotion to Payroll Manager by Buchtler was to appoint a male rather than to promote from within the department a fully qualified female payroll clerk.  The rule in this circuit is that a Title VII plaintiff can prove discrimination-based causation by showing that the employer\\'s discriminatory intent was a \"significant factor\" in the allegedly illegal employment decision.   Whiting v. Jackson State University, 616 F.2d 116, 121 (5th Cir.1980).\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      (3) Prior to Weidig\\'s final appointment as Payroll Manager, in late 1973 Ms. Glass complained to her superiors of what she felt to be illegal discrimination against her because of her sex.  Following this complaint, Buchtler and other superiors refused to talk with her.  Subsequently, although she remained responsible for salaried payroll and for secretarial tasks after her transfer to another section of the Department with additional duties, the Petro-Tex superiors, in the district court\\'s words, \"deliberately gave excessive work to Ms. Glass in reaction to her opposition to sexual discrimination.\"    Other employees corroborated her complaints of hostility, and one of them testified that it was reasonably apparent that her superiors were trying to get rid of her and would eventually fire her.  Due to the intolerable atmosphere at Petro-Tex, Ms. Glass resigned on May 21, 1974, after Weidig\\'s promotion over her on May 1, and on June 21, 1974 timely filed a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Commission, alleging sexual discrimination and constructive discharge.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      (4) Following termination in May 1974 of her employment with Petro-Tex, Ms. Glass, a woman in her early fifties, was quite unsuccessful in securing other employment.  She contracted with two employment agencies and submitted twentysix job applications and, although she secured several jobs for a short period of time, was unable to secure permanent employment.  The district court explicitly found that Ms. Glass exercised reasonable diligence in seeking comparable employment until August 1977, when she ceased looking for work, and implicitly found that Ms. Glass left her interim jobs only because of extenuating circumstances.  Petro-Tex had the burden at trial of establishing, in mitigation of its liability for back-pay that Ms. Glass did not exercise due diligence in seeking comparable employment following her constructive discharge.   Marks v. Pratco, Inc., 633 F.2d 1122, 1125 (5th Cir.1981).  We are unable to find that the district court committed reversible clear error in finding that Petro-Tex did not meet this burden.  See, id., 633 F.2d at 1125.\\n    \\n    DISCUSSION\\n    I.\\n    \\n      19\\n      In extremely persuasive briefs and argument, Petro-Tex attacks these factual findings as clearly erroneous.  Indeed, absent the district court\\'s superior opportunity for demeanor evaluation and the deference required on appeal to its factual evaluations and reasonable factual inferences drawn from the evidence, we would be troubled as to two of the above factual findings:  (a) that Weidig\\'s 1974 promotion was motivated by Buchtler\\'s bias against promoting women employees rather than by Weidig\\'s qualifications;  and (2) that, following termination of her Petro-Tex employment, Ms. Glass\\'s efforts to secure other employment (in mitigation of damages to be owed her by Petro-Tex) were sufficiently diligent and dedicated.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      However, an appellate court is not free to reweigh the evidence or to re-evaluate credibility of witnesses or to substitute for the district court\\'s reasonable factual inferences from the evidence other inferences that the reviewing court may regard as more reasonable.   Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 284, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1788, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982).  \"Findings of fact shall not be set aside [on review] unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\"    Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      We have consistently construed this rule to mean that:\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.  Where the evidence would support a conclusion either way, a choice by the trial judge between two permissible views of the weight of the evidence is not clearly erroneous, and the fact that the trial judge totally rejected an opposed view impeaches neither his impartiality nor the propriety of his conclusions.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Griffin v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 413 F.2d 9, 12-13 (5th Cir.1969) (quoting Chaney v. City of Galveston, 368 F.2d 774, 776 (5th Cir.1966)).   See also Croy v. Campbell, 624 F.2d 709, 710-11 n. 1 (5th Cir.1980).  We have also consistently stated that \"[t]he burden of proving that the findings are clearly erroneous is ... on the party attacking them.\"   Griffin, supra, at 13.   See also Gupta v. East Texas State University, 654 F.2d 411, 414 (5th Cir.1981).\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      Evaluated by these standards, although we admit the issue may be close in the two respects noted, we are unable to hold that the district court\\'s findings are clearly erroneous as to intentional discrimination in the 1969 and 1974 promotions, as to the \"continuing violation\" by sexual discrimination that they manifest (see II below), as to the constructive discharge, or as to Ms. Glass\\'s requisite mitigation of her damages.\\n    \\n    II.\\n    \\n      25\\n      In awarding Ms. Glass back-pay relief, the district court found that Petro-Tex\\'s policy against promoting women manifested a \"continuing\" violation from 1969 through the last discriminatory denial of promotion to Ms. Glass in 1974, so that the failure to promote in May 1974, a month before the EEOC charge, was a present violation, a discrete act of discrimination, sufficient to trigger the time within to file the discrimination charges with the Commission under Title VII.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Accordingly, as the back-pay remedy, the district court did not award Ms. Glass back pay (the difference between the paymaster\\'s salary and Ms. Glass\\'s actual earnings) simply from the date of discriminatory denial of promotion in 1974.  Instead, reasoning that Ms. Glass had been the victim of employment discrimination from the denial of the first promotion in 1969 to the end of her employment immediately following the 1974 denial of promotion--because of Petro-Tex\\'s continuing policy disfavoring promotion of women to supervisory positions--the district court awarded her back-pay as damages during the entire period (but see note 4 infra ) and for the period following her 1974 constructive discharge until her efforts to secure reemployment ceased in 1977.2\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      The contention that the district court erred in this \"continuing violation\" holding is, we think, the most substantial contention on this appeal.  However, in the particular configuration of facts now before us, we conclude that the district court\\'s determination in this regard is essentially factual and, thus, is affirmed as not clearly erroneous.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      The parties agree that, since Ms. Glass did not file her charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"Commission\") until June 21, 1974, Title VII\\'s statute of limitations bars her claim for relief for the discriminatory failure to promote her in 1969,3 unless that failure was part of a \"continuing violation\" of Title VII.  As noted, the district court found a continuing violation and therefore no bar to recovery.4   We agree.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      On at least three occasions, we have stated that the \"[c]ase law on the subject of continuing violations [is] \\'inconsistent and confusing\\' ....\"  Dumas v. Town of Mount Vernon, 612 F.2d 974, 977 (5th Cir.1980);  Scarlett v. Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Co., 676 F.2d 1043, 1049 (5th Cir.1982);  Berry v. Board of Supervisors of L.S.U., 715 F.2d 971, 979 n. 11 (5th Cir.1983).  The core idea, however, is that \"[e]quitable considerations may very well require that the filing periods not begin to run until facts supportive of a Title VII charge or civil rights action are or should be apparent to a reasonably prudent person similarly situated.\"    Dumas, supra, 612 F.2d at 978.5   \" \\'The focus is on what event, in fairness and logic, should have alerted the average lay person to act to protect his rights.\\' \"    Id.  At the same time, \"the mere perpetuation of the effects of time-barred discrimination does not constitute a violation of Title VII in the absence of independent actionable conduct occurring within the statutory period\" (which is now 180 days).   Trevino v. Celanese Corporation, 701 F.2d 397, 403 n. 7 (5th Cir.1983) (emphasis in original).  See generally, 2 A. Larson, Employment Discrimination Sec. 48.54(c) (1984).\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      Thus, Ms. Glass would establish that a continuing violation occurred by showing (1) that some \"independent actionable conduct\" occurred during the statutory period (here, the 1974 non-promotion) and (2) that she did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have realized that the 1969 discrimination was itself actionable until within 180 days of the date that she filed her charge with the Commission.  With regard to this second requirement, our circuit jurisprudence has noted that prohibited employment discrimination in promotion and transfer may often be a continuing violation.   Trevino v. Celanese Corporation, supra, 701 F.2d at 402, and decisions there cited.  A persisting and continuing system of discriminatory practices in promotion or transfer produces effects that may not manifest themselves as individually discriminatory except in cumulation over a period of time.  Id.  See also Clark v. Olinkraft, Incorporated, 556 F.2d 1219 (5th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1060, 98 S.Ct. 1251, 55 L.Ed.2d 772 (1978).  In this context, \"[t]he persistence of a system of promotion and transfers ... animated by a spirit of unlawful discrimination constitutes a continuing violation of Title VII.\"   Trevino, supra, 701 F.2d at 403, n. 7.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      The district court found, and we agree, that Petro-Tex discriminated against Ms. Glass on May 1, 1974, when the company chose Weidig to be payroll manager.  This act of discrimination constituted independent actionable conduct within the statutory period.  Petro-Tex argues, however, that no pre-existing continuing violation occurred because Ms. Glass knew or should have known of the 1969 discrimination by no later than November 15, 1973, the date on which she was transferred to another section of the Treasury Department.  Petro-Tex contends that, since Ms. Glass failed to file a charge with the Commission within 180 days of that date, her 1969 claim is time-barred.6\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      Petro-Tex alleges that there are three separate events that show Ms. Glass either knew or should have known of the 1969 discrimination more than 180 days before she filed her charge with the Commission.  The first event occurred in 1969, when her supervisor Wehunt told Ms. Glass that she would not be named to replace him because Petro-Tex wanted his replacement to be a man.  The second occurred sometime in 1971, when Ms. Glass told another supervisor that she, rather than Pryhoda, should have received the 1969 promotion.  The third occurred in late 1973, shortly before Ms. Glass was transferred to the other section, when she complained to her supervisor that the failure to promote her in 1969 was an illegal act of discrimination.  Ms. Glass herself testified at trial that each of these events occurred.7\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      Petro-Tex\\'s argument is persuasive but not compelling.  The district court in essence found that Ms. Glass did not have actual knowledge that she had been intentionally discriminated against in 1969 until Buchtler, the Treasurer, promoted Weidig over her in May 1974.  Prior to that time, Ms. Glass doubtless suspected she had been discriminated against.  No concrete evidence of knowledge, however, as opposed to mere suspicion has been identified--no admission of knowledge at trial, for example, and no claim by a Petro-Tex superior of having verified Wehunt\\'s 1969 statement to Ms. Glass.  As late as the trial below, Petro-Tex contended, as it does on appeal, that Pryhoda was appointed over Ms. Glass in 1969 because he was more qualified by his general educational background.  Petro-Tex simply points to the three events described above.  Given this, the district court declined to find that Ms. Glass\\' suspicions were tantamount to knowledge of actionable intentional discrimination.  In our view, this is not clearly erroneous.\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      The more difficult question is whether, given her suspicions, Ms. Glass should have realized that the 1969 non-promotion was discriminatory at a later date that was more than 180 days before she filed her charge with the Commission.  We think Ms. Glass\\' appreciation of what happened in 1969 is best understood in light of the ancient maxim \"One swallow does not make a spring.\"    Aristotle, Nichomachean Ethics, (Book I) (Athens, Greece;  circa 340 B.C.).  A reasonably prudent employee, one who is reasonably ambitious, conscientious, and trusting, as the record reveals Ms. Glass to have been, will not necessarily conclude that her employer is an illegal discriminator on the basis of one conversation (based on hearsay) and one act that is at least arguably non-discriminatory.  Without additional evidence, she is just as likely as not to give her employer the benefit of the doubt and, in so doing, strive to disconfirm her own suspicions.\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      Here all that Ms. Glass had to go on, prior to being denied a promotion a second time in May 1974, was a single hearsay statement by Wehunt and the consequent promotion of Pryhoda in 1969.  Nothing in the record suggests that any other supervisor or manager at Petro-Tex ever verified Wehunt\\'s allegations or confirmed Ms. Glass\\' suspicions.  What is more, following her conversation with Wehunt, Ms. Glass continued to work conscientiously, received annual merit-pay increases, and, as the evidence suggests, continued to hope that her efforts would be rewarded.  Taking all of this into account, the district court in essence found that Ms. Glass need not have known of the 1969 discrimination as actionable, and need not have abandoned her hopes for a promotion, until she was discriminated against again, in 1974, at which time she finally realized that her desire for promotion was hopeless because of Petro-Tex\\'s continuing policy against promotion of women to supervisory positions in the Treasury Department.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      We are unable to hold that these findings are clearly erroneous and, therefore, reversible.8III.\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      Petro-Tex\\'s remaining contention is that the district court abused its discretion in the amount of attorneys\\' fees awarded.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      The district court reviewed Ms. Glass\\' request for attorneys\\' fees in light of the twelve factors articulated in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974).  After doing so, the court awarded Ms. Glass $40,987.50.  Petro-Tex contends that this amount is excessive for several reasons:  (1) because the hourly rate of trial counsel ($150) was too high;  (2) because the district court failed to distinguish between in-court and out-of-court time;  (3) because trial counsel had little experience in handling sex-discrimination cases;  and (4) because many of the hours spent preparing for trial were duplicative.\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      As we stated in Welch v. University of Texas, 659 F.2d 531, 535 (5th Cir.1981), \"[t]he district court has broad discretion in awarding attorney fees;  the amount will be altered only in the event of a clear showing of abuse of discretion.\"   See also Chescheir v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 713 F.2d 1142, 1150 (5th Cir.1983).  We have considered the district court\\'s evaluation of the Johnson factors and find ample support in the record for the court\\'s award.  We therefore conclude that Petro-Tex has failed to make a clear showing of abuse of discretion.\\n    \\n    IV. Conclusion\\n    \\n      40\\n      Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the district court.\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      AFFIRMED.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         Two other reasons were also assigned for the appointment of Weidig over Ms. Glass, which the district court also found to be pretextual.  Without detailed discussion, we will simply state that this finding is far from clearly erroneous\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         The district court reached this award as follows:  It first determined the pay of the person who held the payroll manager position from 1972 (see note 4) to 1977 that, under its findings, Ms. Glass had been entitled to hold.  From that figure, it subtracted Ms. Glass\\'s actual earnings during the period from Petro-Tex and subsequent employers, arriving at a net award of some sixty thousand dollars.  Although Petro-Tex quibbles at some of the figures, we are unable to find reversible clear error in the factual holdings that resulted in this net award\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         In 1969, a Title VII plaintiff had 90 days to file her claim.  In 1972, Congress amended Title VII to require filing within 180 days.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(e).   See United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 555 n. 3, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 1887 n. 3, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977).  The Supreme Court recently held in Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 1132, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982), that the 180 period functions as a statute of limitations rather than as a prerequisite to subject matter jurisdiction\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         The district court properly held that, even though Ms. Glass is entitled to recover on her 1969 claim, her recovery is limited to the two-year period prior to the filing of the charge with the Commission--the period between June 21, 1972 and June 21, 1974.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(g).   See Berry v. Board of Supervisors of L.S.U., 715 F.2d 971, 980 (5th Cir.1983)\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         In Berry, we identified three factors that are relevant to determining whether a continuing violation has occurred:  \"The first is subject matter.  Do the alleged acts involve the same type of discrimination, tending to connect them in a continuing violation?    The second is frequency.  Are the alleged acts recurring (e.g., a biweekly paycheck) or more in the nature of an isolated work assignment or employment decision?\"   Berry, supra, 715 F.2d at 981.  In the present case, the subject matter (promotion to payroll manager) is the same, but the acts of discrimination (failure to promote) did not occur frequently.  We also stated in Berry that the \"third factor, perhaps of most importance, is degree of permanence.  Does the act have the degree of permanence which should trigger an employee\\'s awareness of and duty to assert his or her rights, ...?\"  Id.    We view this third factor as embodying the \"core idea\" expressed in the text, supra\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         Petro-Tex further contends that Ms. Glass waived her right to seek recovery for the continuing violation by waiting until she submitted her pre-trial order to assert such a right.  We disagree.  In Nevels v. Ford Motor Company, 439 F.2d 251, 257 (5th Cir.1971), we stated:  \"While it is generally true that leave to file amendments should be freely given, Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), amendments should be tendered no later than the time of pretrial, unless compelling reasons why this could not have been done are presented.\"    In light of this principle, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in allowing Ms. Glass to amend\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         Although there is some dispute as to whether Ms. Glass discussed the 1969 promotion with her superior in both 1971 and 1973, or only in one or the other of those years, or perhaps only in 1972, we interpret the district court as having found that two discussions took place--one in 1971 and the other in 1973.  We think, moreover, that the record supports this finding\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         Petro-Tex argues that this case is indistinguishable from Dumas v. Town of Mount Vernon, 612 F.2d 974 (5th Cir.1980), where we found no continuing violation.  In Dumas, the plaintiff wrote the Commission a letter on May 22, 1975, to supplement a discrimination charge she had filed the previous year.  Nearly two years passed before the Commission issued her a right to sue letter, and it was not until March 1977 that she filed suit.  In her complaint, she argued, inter alia, that the town of Mount Vernon, Alabama had refused to hire her because of her race.  Stating that \"the statutes of limitations applicable to actions under Secs. 1981, 1983, 1985(3) and 1986 [all one year in Dumas ] are not tolled while an EEOC claim is pending,\" Dumas, supra, at 979, we declared that the plaintiff\\'s claim was time-barred unless she could establish a continuing violation.  We concluded, however, \"that [her] claim was properly dismissed since it affirmatively appears from [her] May 22, 1975, letter to the EEOC ... that she viewed the Town\\'s decision not to fill the vacancy as a discriminatory refusal to hire her.\"   Id. at 978.  By contrast, not only does the present case involve oral communications but, more important, the district court here implicitly found that these communications did not indicate that Ms. Glass knew or should have known that she had been discriminated against more than 180 days before she filed her charge.  This was a factual determination.  Although we might view the communications differently were we considering the matter de novo, the district court\\'s finding is not clearly erroneous\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 449667}]"},{"id":740591,"date_filed":"1997-05-20","judges":null,"case_name_full":"Rachel Renteria v.

Our decision in this case follows from our decision in Prudential Insurance Co. of America v. Lai, 42 F.3d 1299 (9th Cir.1994).  We affirm the order of the district court.\\n    \\n    BACKGROUND\\n    \\n      2\\n      On March 22, 1992, Prudential Insurance Company hired Rachel Renteria as a registered representative to solicit and sell securities and insurance products.  Before joining Prudential, she completed a Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer, also known as a Form U-4, which contained an arbitration clause, binding Renteria to arbitrate:\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      any dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm, or a customer, or any other person, that is required to be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions, or by-laws of the organizations indicated in Item 10 as may be amended from time to time and that any arbitration award rendered against me may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      The organization indicated in Item 10 was the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and, at the time Renteria signed the Form U-4, the NASD Code provided that:\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      [a]ny dispute, claim or controversy eligible for submission under Part I of this Code between or among members and\/or associated persons, and\/or certain others, arising in connection with the business of such member(s) or in connection with the activities of such associated person(s), shall be arbitrated under this Code.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      On October 1, 1993, the NASD Code was amended to include claims \"arising out of the employment or termination of employment of such associated person(s) by and with such member,\" as a category of claims subject to disposition by arbitration.  Six days later, Prudential fired Renteria.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      On October 7, 1994, Renteria filed a complaint against Prudential alleging various claims including sexual harassment under Title VII and state statutes.  The case was removed to federal court where Prudential successfully moved for summary judgment on all but the sexual harassment claims.  Prudential also moved to compel arbitration of the sexual harassment claims, but the district court denied the motion, finding the case \"on all fours\" with our decision in Lai, 42 F.3d 1299:\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Prudential is a party in both cases;  both cases are sexual discrimination cases;  in both cases the plaintiff signed the same U-4 forms containing an arbitration clause.  In both cases, the issue is whether the arbitration clause signed by plaintiffs includes Title 7 Claims.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      The Court in Lai held that the plaintiffs were not bound by any valid agreement to arbitrate their sexual discrimination claims, because the plaintiffs could not have understood that they were agreeing to arbitrate sexual discrimination suits.  It is the opinion of this Court that Lai is indistinguishable, and the Court should deny the motion to compel arbitration under Lai.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      Prudential then filed this appeal.\\n    \\n    DISCUSSION\\n    \\n      11\\n      In Lai, we held that \"a Title VII plaintiff may only be forced to forego her statutory remedies and arbitrate her claims if she has knowingly agreed to submit such disputes to arbitration.\"1  Id. at 1305.   This \"knowing waiver\" requirement, which we concluded was \"apparent from the text and legislative history of Title VII,\" id. at 1304, \"reflects our public policy of protecting victims of sexual discrimination and harassment through the provisions of Title VII and analogous state statutes\"--\"a policy that is at least as strong as our public policy in favor of arbitration.\"  Id. at 1305.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      In Lai, the plaintiffs were employed by Prudential Insurance Company as sales representatives.  As part of their employment applications, they were asked to sign a Standard Application for Securities Industry Registration (U-4 form), like the one signed by Renteria.  The U-4 form signed by the plaintiffs in Lai contained the following provision:\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      I agree to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between me or my firm, or a customer, or any other person, that is required to be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions, or bylaws of the organizations with which I register.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Id. at 1302.   They subsequently registered with the National Association of Securities Dealers, which, at the time in question, required the arbitration of\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      [a]ny dispute, claim or controversy eligible for submission under part I of this Code between or among members and\/or associated persons ... arising in connection with the business of such member(s) or in connection with the activities of such associated person(s)....\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Id. Lai and her co-plaintiff Viernes later brought a state law sexual harassment and discrimination claims against Prudential, which sought to compel arbitration under the U-4 form and the NASD Code.  Id. at 1301.   Lai and Viernes asserted that they were not given the opportunity to read the U-4 form before they signed it and were not given a copy of the NASD Code.  Id. They claimed ignorance of the arbitration agreement, and further asserted that even had they been aware of the agreement to arbitrate disputes, they would not have known they were agreeing to arbitrate their employment discrimination claims.  Id. at 1303.   We agreed and held that\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      even assuming that appellants were aware of the nature of the U-4 form, they could not have understood that in signing it, they were agreeing to arbitrate sexual discrimination suits.  The U-4 form did not purport to describe the types of disputes that were to be subject to arbitration.  Moreover, even if appellants had signed a contract containing the NASD arbitration clause, it would not put them on notice that they were bound to arbitrate Title VII claims.  That provision did not even refer to employment disputes.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Id. at 1305.   That holding controls the outcome of the case currently before us.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      Like the plaintiffs in Lai, Renteria signed the U-4 form as a condition of her employment with Prudential Insurance Company and registered with NASD, thereby becoming subject to its Code provisions.  At the time Renteria signed the U-4 form and at the time she registered with the NASD, the arbitration provision in the NASD Code was exactly the same as that in effect when the plaintiffs in Lai signed their U-4 form and registered with NASD.  To that extent, Lai and Renteria are indistinguishable.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      The single difference of any significance between the cases is that the arbitration provision in the U-4 form signed by Renteria stated that the undersigned was bound to arbitrate all disputes listed in the NASD Code, \"as may be amended from time to time.\"   It is upon this difference that Prudential\\'s appeal must rise or fall.  We conclude that the \"as amended\" language does not take the case out of the Lai rule.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      First, it is not altogether clear that the addition of the words \"as may be amended from time to time\" suggests a meaning different from the provision the plaintiffs in Lai signed.  Lai and her co-plaintiff agreed to arbitrate any claim \"required to be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions, or bylaws of the organizations with which I register.\"  42 F.3d at 1302.   Nothing in that language suggests that the agreements limited the rules to those as they existed at the time the plaintiffs registered.  The \"as amended\" language of Renteria only makes explicit what may be implicit in the Lai provision.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      More important, the \"as may be amended from time to time\" language simply does not cure the flaw the Lai court found in the agreement to arbitrate.  As we expressly stated in Lai, \"Our decision does not rest exclusively upon the precise language of the clause in the U-4 manual, for it is clear and undisputed on this record that the employment contract with Prudential that plaintiffs executed did not describe any disputes that the parties agreed to arbitrate.\"  42 F.3d at 1305 (emphasis added).  We then explicitly rejected the U-4 form and the NASD Manual as effective waivers of statutory rights because neither \"described the types of disputes that were to be subject to arbitration\" or \"even refer[red] to employment disputes.\"  Id. In the case at hand, the arbitration clause did not--any more than it did in Lai--\"describe any disputes that the parties agreed to arbitrate.\"   Simply adding the \"as amended\" language to the U-4 form did not accomplish that result.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Prudential makes a number of further related arguments why Lai does not dictate the outcome in this case.  None withstands analysis.  First, it argues that the NASD Code, as amended at the time Renteria was terminated and brought her sexual harassment claims, adequately served to put members on notice that employment disputes were subject to mandatory arbitration.  This argument is dependent on the further contention that the knowing waiver required under Lai must be measured, not from \"the time [Renteria] signed the Form U-4,\" but instead from either the time of her termination or the time the \"suit is filed in derogation of the arbitration provision.\"   However, this is simply inconsistent with the Lai requirement that employees must expressly agree to waive Title VII\\'s statutory remedies knowing that they are doing so.  Whether an agreement to arbitrate constitutes a knowing waiver of a right is analyzed from the time the agreement is made.2\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      Second, Prudential argues that to apply Lai in this case would render the \"as may be amended\" language a nullity, in contravention of well-settled rules of contract interpretation.  See, e.g., Brinderson-Newberg Joint Venture v. Pacific Erectors, Inc., 971 F.2d 272, 278-79 (9th Cir.1992) (\"a contract should be interpreted so as to give meaning to each of its provisions\").  We disagree.  The Lai knowing waiver requirement applies only to a comparatively small class of claims arising under Title VII or similar laws--and derives from a recognition of the importance of the federal policy of protecting the victims of discrimination.  Accordingly, Lai would have no bearing on various other classes of claims, and the as amended language would have full force and effect in a whole range of cases.  E.g., Kuehner, 84 F.3d at 320.   More important, if application of Lai rendered the as amended language a nullity, it would do so because the language contravened federal law.  Thus, Prudential\\'s argument is without substance.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      Next, Prudential argues that Nevada state contract law renders the decision in Lai inapposite.  It suggests that Nevada law \"establishes a presumption that arbitration agreements are valid and binding, and intended to cover all disputes not specifically excluded,\" and that under Nevada law, the broad language of the NASD is \"sufficient to make claims not expressly excluded arbitrable.\" This argument misconceives our decision in Lai.  We held in Lai that there must be a knowing waiver of the statutory remedies not because we concluded that federal law under the Federal Arbitration Act insufficiently favors arbitration, but rather because we found that in enacting Title VII Congress intended such a result.  Nevada state law, then, adds nothing to the equation.  The Lai court held that the Title VII waiver must be knowing, notwithstanding federal policy favoring arbitration.  State law cannot weaken the protections this court has concluded Congress intended to create under Title VII.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Finally, Prudential argues that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing on the question of Renteria\\'s subjective knowledge.  We did not require such a hearing in Lai.  Our decision turned instead on the language of the arbitration clauses.  We held that a knowing waiver does not occur where neither the arbitration clauses nor any other written employment agreement expressly put the plaintiffs \"on notice that they were bound to arbitrate Title VII claims.\"  Lai, 42 F.3d at 1305.   That holding is equally applicable here.  No evidentiary hearing is required.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      Accordingly, we conclude that the district court properly denied Prudential\\'s motion to compel arbitration of Renteria\\'s sexual harassment claims.\\n    \\n    CONCLUSION\\n    \\n      28\\n      Consistent with our holding in Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Lai, Renteria cannot be compelled to arbitrate Title VII and related state law claims which she did not knowingly agree to arbitrate.  Here, as in Lai, there was no express waiver of the statutory remedies in the written agreement executed by plaintiff.  Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the district court.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      AFFIRMED.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        *\\n         The Honorable Jack E. Tanner, Senior United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         Although plaintiffs in Lai brought their sexual harassment claims under state law, we analyzed the arbitrability of those claims under the requirements we held were imposed by Title VII. 42 F.3d at 1304.   We noted that \"parallel state anti-discrimination laws are explicitly made part of Title VII\\'s enforcement scheme\" and held that the same standard would thus apply.  Id. at 1303 n. 1\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         In Kuehner v. Dickinson &amp; Co., 84 F.3d 316 (9th Cir.1996), we held that the issue of arbitrability in a suit for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and wrongful discharge filed after the October 1, 1993 amendments to the NASD Code was governed by the new NASD rules rather than the old.  Id. at 320-21.   We expressly held in Kuehner, however, that the Lai \"knowing waiver\" rule did not apply to FLSA claims.  Id. at 320.   Because we conclude that the Kuehner holding is intended to apply to cases in which there is no \"knowing waiver\" requirement, we decline to extend its analysis here.  Accordingly, we do not reach the question of whether the NASD Code as amended satisfies the knowing waiver requirement of Lai\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 740591}]"},{"id":501843,"date_filed":"1988-03-18","judges":"Johnson, Reavley, Sneed","case_name_full":"Mary Juanita SELLERS, Plaintiff-Appellant\/Cross-Appellee, v.

Because we perceive error in the magistrate\\'s determination of damages, we vacate the judgment and remand for a redetermination of damages.  However, discerning no error in the magistrate\\'s order awarding Sellers attorney\\'s fees, we affirm that order.\\n    \\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\\n    \\n      2\\n      In 1982, plaintiff Mary Sellers brought this employment discrimination suit against her previous employer, Delgado, pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e et seq.    After the case was tried by consent before a magistrate, the court entered a judgment finding that Sellers\\' rights under Title VII had been violated when she had been paid less than a comparably qualified male employee who performed essentially the same job as Sellers.  Additionally, the magistrate found that Sellers had been constructively discharged in violation of Title VII.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Following the determination on the merits, the magistrate awarded Sellers back monetary relief.  Sellers appealed that award.  This Court, concluding that the magistrate\\'s findings were inadequate to support the award, vacated the judgment and remanded for a trial on the damages.    Sellers v. Delgado Community College, et al., 781 F.2d 503 (5th Cir.1986).  On remand, the magistrate conducted an evidentiary hearing to develop facts pertinent to Sellers\\' claims for back pay and front pay.  As the facts surrounding the constructive discharge of Sellers by Delgado in 1978 are accurately set forth in this Court\\'s previous opinion, Sellers, 781 F.2d at 504, we will not reiterate those facts at this time except as relevant to the calculation of Sellers\\' back pay award.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Sellers was initially employed by Delgado in 1975.  Referred to by some as the Director of Public Information for the college, Sellers\\' responsibilities included preparing press releases and brochures, and working on school publications.  Additionally, Sellers worked on material advertising events and generally coordinated the public relations efforts of Delgado.  On July 1, 1976, Delgado hired Michael Whittier, who eventually assumed much of the responsibility for the public relations efforts of Delgado, thereby encroaching on Sellers\\' work.  By May 1977, Whittier and Sellers were performing substantially the same job duties.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Following her unlawful discharge from Delgado in February 1978, Sellers completed the requirements for her master\\'s degree in journalism in July of that same year.  Sellers testified that between February 1978 and July 1981 she attempted to find public relations work, but to no avail.  The magistrate found Sellers\\' first documented attempt at obtaining comparable employment to be a letter in October 1978 reflecting an interview at McDonnel Douglas.  During this time, however, Sellers was able to obtain a few temporary clerical and secretarial jobs while she continued to look for public relations work.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      In July 1981, Sellers was hired as secretary to a public relations officer for Gulf Oil Company in New Orleans, but was subsequently transferred to Gulf\\'s Office of Comptroller as an executive secretary when the public relations office in New Orleans closed.  Thereafter, in December 1982, Sellers voluntarily resigned from Gulf, receiving a severance payment of one month\\'s salary.  Sellers testified that she left Gulf because there was no chance of advancement to a professional position at Gulf and, if she did not resign, she would be laid off in the future without severance benefits.  Following her resignation from Gulf, Sellers continued to seek employment in the public relations field and in November 1983, obtained employment as a \"biscuit instructor\" at Popeye\\'s Fried Chicken.  In August 1984, Sellers resigned from Popeye\\'s and moved to Dallas to seek public relations work.  However, by October 1986, Sellers was unable to obtain employment comparable to her position at Delgado, despite her efforts to do so.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      After the evidentiary hearing on damages in May 1986, the magistrate awarded back monetary relief to Sellers, calculating the award of back pay by comparing Sellers\\' earnings with those of Whittier during the same period.  For the period between May 1977, the date the duties of Sellers and Whittier merged, and December 1982, the date Sellers resigned her position at Gulf, the magistrate awarded Sellers the difference between Sellers\\' earnings and those of Whittier.  However, the magistrate \"tolled\" Sellers\\' back pay award between January 1983 and November 1983, the period immediately following Sellers\\' resignation from Gulf, concluding that Sellers effectively removed herself from the job market by resigning from Gulf and thereby failed to mitigate her damages.  Between November 1983 and July 1984, the period Sellers was employed as a \"biscuit instructor\" at Popeye\\'s, the magistrate concluded that Sellers had \"reentered\" the job market and was therefore entitled to back pay;  however, the magistrate calculated the award by comparing Whittier\\'s earnings with those Sellers would have been earning had she remained at Gulf, reasoning that \"it is probable that [Sellers] would still be working at Gulf had she not quit.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      The magistrate further \"tolled\" Sellers\\' back pay award for the period between July 1984 and December 1984, once again concluding that Sellers had effectively removed herself from the job market by resigning from Popeye\\'s.  Determining that Sellers had reentered the job market as of January 1985, the magistrate awarded back pay after that date, but again based on what Sellers would have been earning had she retained her position at Gulf.  The magistrate also awarded Sellers lost retirement and health benefits, less the amount of benefits earned during the time Sellers\\' back pay award was tolled.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      As to Sellers\\' claim for front pay, the magistrate concluded that had Sellers remained at Gulf, she would more than likely have obtained her \"rightful place\" by the date of the evidentiary hearing in May 1986 and therefore, denied front pay.  Additionally, the magistrate denied a request by Sellers for prejudgment interest on her back pay award, holding that \"although the facts were sufficient to support a finding of constructive discharge, there was no evidence that (Delgado\\'s) officers intended by their discriminatory actions that (Sellers) resign or be fired.\"    Both Sellers and Delgado appeal the magistrate\\'s damage award to this Court.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      On appeal, Sellers contends that the magistrate erred in (1) treating her resignations from Gulf and Popeye\\'s as failures to mitigate damages and thereby reducing her back pay award;  (2) denying prejudgment interest on the award of back pay;  and (3) denying her claim for front pay, despite the fact that she has been unable to obtain employment substantially comparable to the position she held at Delgado.  On cross-appeal, Delgado asserts that the magistrate erred in awarding Sellers back pay (1) when the evidence allegedly proves she would not have received a salary comparable to that of Whittier even absent discrimination;  (2) when she was not justified in leaving Delgado;  and (3) when she failed to mitigate her damages by diligently seeking employment.  Delgado further contends that the magistrate erred by awarding back pay to Sellers on the basis of a finding that Delgado did not demonstrate that there were any substantially comparable positions available to Sellers during the period she allegedly failed to mitigate damages.\\n    \\n    II. DISCUSSION\\n    A. Back Pay Award\\n    \\n      11\\n      Section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(g) permits an award of back pay to victims of unlawful discrimination.  In pertinent part, section 706(g) provides:\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay,....  Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the Commission.  Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      The Supreme Court has noted that under section 706(g), back pay is not an automatic remedy, but is equitable in nature and may be invoked in the sound discretion of the district court.    Ford Motor Co. v. E.E.O.C., 458 U.S. 219, 226, 102 S.Ct. 3057, 3063, 73 L.Ed.2d 721 (1982).  This discretion, however, must be exercised in light of the large objectives of the Act, and, \"must be guided by \\'meaningful standards\\' enforced by \\'thorough appellate review.\\' \"    Id. (quoting Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 416, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2371, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975)).\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      A back pay award, as all damages awarded pursuant to Title VII, should make whole the injured party by placing that individual in the position he or she would have been in but for the discrimination.    EEOC v. Guardian Pools, Inc., 828 F.2d 1507, 1510 (11th Cir.1987).    See also Rasimas v. Michigan Dept. of Mental Health, 714 F.2d 614, 626 (6th Cir.1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 950, 104 S.Ct. 2151, 80 L.Ed.2d 537 (1984).  Addressing the standards governing back pay awards, the Supreme Court has stated\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      given a finding of unlawful discrimination, backpay should be denied only for reasons which, if applied generally, would not frustrate the central statutory purposes of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 421, 95 S.Ct. at 2373.  \"Thus, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, backpay should always be awarded when a Title VII violation is found\" and the instances wherein such an award is not granted are exceedingly rare.    Rasimas, 714 F.2d at 626.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      Of course, individuals who have been unlawfully discharged in violation of Title VII are not without their responsibilities under the Act.  The Supreme Court outlined those responsibilities in Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, concluding that Title VII claimants are subject to a statutory duty to minimize damages by using reasonable diligence to find other suitable employment.    Ford Motor Co., 458 U.S. at 231, 102 S.Ct. at 3065.1   However, the Supreme Court declined to impose upon an unemployed Title VII claimant a duty to seek employment which is not substantially comparable to the position from which he was unlawfully discharged.  In this regard, the Court in Ford expressly stated, \"[a]lthough the unemployed or underemployed claimant need not go into another line of work, accept a demotion, or take a demeaning position, he forfeits his right to backpay if he refuses a job substantially equivalent to the one he was denied.\"    Id. at 231-32, 102 S.Ct. at 3065-66.  The Supreme Court did recognize that claimants often take other lesser or dissimilar work during the pendency of their Title VII claims;  nevertheless, \"doing so is not mandated by the statutory requirement that a claimant minimize damages or forfeit his right to compensation.\"    Id. at 231 n. 14, 102 S.Ct. at 3065 n. 14.    See also Wheeler v. Snyder Buick, Inc., 794 F.2d 1228, 1234-35 (7th Cir.1986);  Shore v. Federal Express Corp., 777 F.2d 1155, 1158 (6th Cir.1985);  EEOC v. Exxon Shipping Co., 745 F.2d 967, 978 (5th Cir.1984) (quoting NLRB v. Madison Courier, Inc., 472 F.2d 1307 (D.C.Cir.1972) (emphasis in original)) (\"The duty to minimize damages, however, does not obligate the employee to accept a position that \\'is not consonant with his particular skills, background, and experience\\' or \\'which involves conditions that are substantially more onerous than his previous position.\\' \").\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      An issue which the Supreme Court did not specifically address in Ford is whether a Title VII claimant, accepting noncomparable employment during the pendency of his claim, is under an obligation to remain in that noncomparable position to satisfy the duty to mitigate under Title VII.  However, we take guidance from the Court\\'s statement that an obligation to take lesser or dissimilar work during the pendency of a Title VII claim is \"not mandated by the statutory requirement that a claimant minimize damages or forfeit his right to compensation.\"    Ford, 458 U.S. at 231 n. 14, 102 S.Ct. at 3065 n. 14.  The natural concomitant of the Supreme Court\\'s holding that a Title VII claimant is not under an obligation to accept noncomparable employment is that the same claimant is not obligated to remain in an inferior position should he be fortunate enough to obtain one during the pendency of his claim.  If the ruling were otherwise, the remarkable proposition would be established that although Title VII claimants are not obligated to accept a noncomparable position, if an individual does so out of financial necessity or for any other reason, a duty to mitigate would require the claimant to remain in that position.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      In EEOC v. Guardian Pools, Inc., the Eleventh Circuit addressed the scope of a Title VII claimant\\'s duty to mitigate.  In Guardian Pools, the claimant held several noncomparable positions during the back pay period.  The defendant employer argued on appeal that the back pay period should be shortened because the claimant had removed herself from the labor market by resigning from a noncomparable position because of dissatisfaction with the work.  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the employer\\'s contention, stating:\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      We reject Guardian\\'s argument that the period should be reduced because Crozier left her next position after a short period of time.  Title VII requires reasonable diligence in locating employment and mitigating damages;  it does not require that a person remain employed despite dissatisfaction.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      Id. at 1511 (emphasis added).  In a similar vein, the Seventh Circuit held in Wheeler v. Snyder Buick, Inc., that the duty to mitigate damages does not preclude a Title VII plaintiff from quitting a position in a different business that pays substantially less money.    Wheeler, 794 F.2d at 1234-35.  This Court has already determined that a Title VII claimant\\'s obligation to mitigate damages does not require that the claimant accept a position noncomparable or inferior to his previous position.    See Exxon Shipping, 745 F.2d at 978.  Today, we conclude that the duty to mitigate does not require a Title VII claimant to remain in a noncomparable position accepted during the pendency of his claim.  Since Title VII claimants are currently not obliged to accept noncomparable employment, a rule requiring these individuals to remain in such positions, once accepted, would effectively deter claimants from seeking or accepting any type of noncomparable work.2   It follows then, in the instant case, that while any earnings Sellers received from interim noncomparable employment should be deducted from an award of back pay, Sellers had a duty to use reasonable diligence to obtain only that employment which was substantially comparable to her position at Delgado.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      In the instant case, the magistrate held that Sellers\\' resignations from Gulf and Popeye\\'s constituted a failure to mitigate damages and therefore, tolled Sellers\\' back pay award for those periods.  Thus, the proper inquiry becomes whether Sellers\\' positions at Gulf and Popeye\\'s were substantially comparable to her position at Delgado.  If so, Sellers\\' failure to remain in those positions may have constituted a failure to mitigate damages.  However, if the positions were not substantially comparable, the magistrate erred in tolling Sellers\\' back pay award after her resignations from Gulf and Popeye\\'s.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      The determination of whether or not a Title VII claimant uses reasonable diligence in obtaining substantially comparable employment is a determination of fact by the district court which is subject to the \"clearly erroneous\" standard of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).    Marks v. Prattco, 633 F.2d 1122, 1125 (5th Cir.1981).  Once a Title VII claimant has established damages as a result of the discriminatory act of an employer, the burden of proving that the plaintiff has not exercised diligence in seeking comparable employment rests on the employer.  Id.  See also Shore, 777 F.2d at 1158;  Rasimas, 714 F.2d at 623.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      \"Substantially equivalent employment\" for purposes of Title VII mitigation has been defined as employment which affords virtually identical promotional opportunities, compensation, job responsibilities, working conditions, and status as the position from which the Title VII claimant has been discriminatorily terminated.    Rasimas, 714 F.2d at 624.  In addition, the new position should provide comparable hours to the previous position.    McCann Steel Co. v. NLRB, 570 F.2d 652, 655 (6th Cir.1978).  In Rutherford v. American Bank of Commerce, 12 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas.  (BNA), 1184, 1190 (D.N.M.1976) , aff\\'d, 565 F.2d 1162 (10th Cir.1977), the court determined that the claimant did not fail to mitigate her damages when she refused an offer of employment because it failed to take account of her years of experience and offered only remote possibilities for comparable advancement.  Furthermore, in seeking to define what is suitable interim employment for an unlawfully discharged employee, the Circuit for the District of Columbia stated \"[a] discriminatee need not seek or accept employment which is \\'dangerous, distasteful or essentially different\\' from his regular job\" or \"accept employment which is located an unreasonable distance from his home.\"    NLRB v. Madison Courier, Inc., 472 F.2d 1307, 1319 (D.C.Cir.1971) (emphasis in original).  Finally, in assessing whether two positions are substantially comparable, at least one court has focused on comparability in status, rather than comparability in pay, determining that comparability in salary, although important, is not the sole test of a reasonable offer of alternative employment.    Williams v. Albemarle City Board of Education, 508 F.2d 1242, 1243 (4th Cir.1974).  In fact, \"[c]omparability in status is often of far more importance--especially as it relates to opportunites for advancement or for other employment--than comparability in salary.\"    Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      In the instant case, the magistrate concluded that the position which Sellers obtained as secretary at Gulf Oil was substantially comparable to her previous position in public relations at Delgado.  Reviewing this finding under the deferential standard set forth above, we are constrained to conclude that the finding by the magistrate that the two positions were substantially comparable is clearly erroneous.  The positions were not equivalent in terms of pay, status, responsibility, working conditions, or promotional opportunities.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      As a coordinator of public relations at Delgado, Sellers prepared press releases and brochures, worked on school publications, and generally coordinated the public relation efforts of Delgado.  In contrast, the position which Sellers held at Gulf was \"basically a clerical type job\" which involved typing and filing.  No educational requirement existed for Sellers to obtain her position at Gulf;  in fact, the primary qualification for the job was the ability to type.  Of prime importance is the fact that scant promotional opportunities were available to Sellers at Gulf.  Although Sellers frequently inquired about the possibility of obtaining public relations work at Gulf, the public relations office for Gulf was subsequently closed, thereby eliminating the possibility of promotion to that area of the company.  As to comparability in salary, when Sellers began work at Gulf, she earned approximately $21,000.00 per year.  By contrast, Michael Whittier, who had obtained Sellers\\' previous position at Delgado, was earning $28,000.00 per year and by 1983, he was earning $32,675.00 per year.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      Therefore, since we today conclude that a Title VII claimant\\'s duty to mitigate damages does not encompass remaining in a noncomparable position while continuing to seek suitable employment, the magistrate erred when he tolled Sellers\\' back pay award due to her resignation from a noncomparable position at Gulf.  For the same reasons, the magistrate erred in his decision to toll the back pay award on the basis of Sellers\\' resignation as \"biscuit instructor\" at Popeye\\'s, a position clearly not comparable to her position at Delgado.  Finally, when the magistrate did award back pay to Sellers, during the periods he deemed her to have reentered the job market subsequent to her resignations from Gulf and Popeye\\'s, the magistrate premised his back pay award on the amount Sellers would have been earning had she retained her position at Gulf.  Since we have concluded that Sellers\\' position at Gulf was not comparable to her position at Delgado, the magistrate erred by using Sellers\\' earnings at Gulf as a basis for comparison in awarding back monetary relief during those periods.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      On cross-appeal, Delgado asserts that the magistrate erred in awarding Sellers any back pay due to her alleged failure to mitigate damages by diligently seeking employment.  Specifically, Delgado mentioned that Sellers spent most of her time immediately following her unlawful discharge from Delgado pursuing her master\\'s degree.  Additionally, Delgado points to what it perceives to be an inadequate number of job contacts made by Sellers during the relevant period, which it asserts reflects a lack of diligence on her part in conducting a job search.  Finally, Delgado asserts that the magistrate erred in awarding back pay to Sellers on a finding that Delgado failed to satisfy its burden of proving the availability of substantially equivalent positions to Sellers during the relevant period.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      Addressing the latter point first, by alleging that the magistrate erred in requiring Delgado to present evidence of available suitable employment, Delgado attempts to have this Court abrogate the current rule that the employer in a Title VII case has the burden of proving that a claimant has not exercised due diligence in seeking comparable employment after an unlawful discharge.    Marks, 633 F.2d at 1125.  To meet this burden, it has been consistently held that an employer must demonstrate that comparable work was available and the claimant did not seek it out.    See Hanna v. American Motors Corp., 724 F.2d 1300, 1307 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1241, 104 S.Ct. 3512, 82 L.Ed.2d 821 (1984);  Rasimas, 714 F.2d at 623-24;  Jackson v. Shell Oil Co., 702 F.2d 197, 201-02 (9th Cir.1983).\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      If an employer proves that an employee has not made reasonable efforts to obtain work, the employer does not also have to establish the availability of substantially comparable employment.    See Madison Courier, 472 F.2d 1307.  In the instant case, however, Delgado failed to prove that Sellers failed to use diligence in conducting a job search;  therefore, Delgado was not relieved of its burden of proving the availability of suitable employment.  The magistrate stated only that the evidence \"might arguably support a finding that [Sellers] was not diligent in mitigating damages at a time prior to her employment at Gulf,\" not that the evidence did establish such a finding.  Unfortunately, because of the magistrate\\'s equivocal finding on this issue, we must at this time direct that the magistrate make a specific finding regarding Sellers\\' efforts to mitigate on remand.  Without such a specific finding, effective appellate review of Delgado\\'s contentions pertaining to Sellers\\' diligence in mitigating damages is not feasible.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      In sum, because we conclude that the magistrate improperly \"tolled\" Sellers\\' back pay award following her resignations from noncomparable employment, and because we reject Delgado\\'s contentions on cross-appeal, we vacate the judgment regarding the back pay award and remand for a redetermination of damages.  We recognize that the magistrate relied on factors in tolling Sellers\\' back pay award,3 other than her resignations from Gulf and Popeye\\'s;  however, perceiving the resignations to be the primary basis for the magistrate\\'s decision, we remand.  On remand, the magistrate is free to make new findings regarding the damage award.  In making these findings, the magistrate may take additional evidence and shape a judgment accordingly.4\\n    \\n    B. Prejudgment Interest\\n    \\n      32\\n      Sellers further contends on appeal that the magistrate erred when he denied her prejudgment interest on the award of back pay.  While prejudgment interest is available on back pay awards in Title VII cases, the decision to award such interest rests within the sound discretion of the district court.    Bunch v. Bullard, 795 F.2d 384, 399 (5th Cir.1986).  Accordingly, we will not overturn the district court\\'s determination in the absence of an abuse of discretion.  However, just as an award or denial of back pay by the district court must be guided by sound legal principles, so also must a decision on prejudgment interest be similarly guided.\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      This Circuit has consistently approved awards of prejudgment interest by the district court in Title VII cases so as to make whole the injured party.    See Bunch, 795 F.2d at 399;  Parson v. Kaiser Aluminum Chemical Corp., 727 F.2d 473, 478 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1243, 104 S.Ct. 3516, 82 L.Ed.2d 824 (1984);  Whiting v. Jackson State University, 616 F.2d 116, 127 n. 8 (5th Cir.1980);  Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d 211, 263 (5th Cir.1974), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1243, 104 S.Ct. 3515, 82 L.Ed.2d 824 (1984), cert. dism\\'d, 467 U.S. 1247, 104 S.Ct. 3526, 82 L.Ed.2d 833 (1984).  In fact, this Court stated in Pettway that interest is an item that should be included in back pay.    Pettway, 494 F.2d at 263.\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      In the instant case, the magistrate denied prejudgment interest on the back pay award, reasoning that although the facts supported a finding of constructive discharge by Delgado, there was no evidence that Delgado\\'s officers intended by their discriminatory actions that Sellers resign or be fired.  In Young v. Southwestern Savings and Loan Ass\\'n, 509 F.2d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1975), this Court addressed the issue of constructive discharge, stating:\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      The general rule is that if the employer deliberately makes an employee\\'s working conditions so intolerable that the employee is forced into an involuntary resignation, then the employer has encompassed a constructive discharge and is as liable for any illegal conduct involved therein as if it had formally discharged the aggrieved employee.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      (emphasis added).\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      Consistent with this Court\\'s previous explanation in Young of the concept of constructive discharge and the liability attendant with such action, we conclude that the magistrate abused his discretion in denying prejudgment interest on the basis that Delgado did not intend by its actions that Sellers resign or be fired.  The magistrate\\'s holding suggests that employers who constructively discharge their employees are somehow less guilty of violations of Title VII than employers who formally discharge their employees.  Such a result would be inconsistent with the policy and objectives of Title VII to make whole the victims of unlawful discrimination so far as possible.    Ford, 458 U.S. at 230, 102 S.Ct. at 3065.\\n    \\n    C. Front Pay\\n    \\n      38\\n      Sellers further asserts that the magistrate erred in denying her claim for front pay under the circumstances of this case.  In his findings and conclusions denying such relief to Sellers, the magistrate reasoned that had Sellers remained in her position as secretary at Gulf, she would have achieved her \"rightful place\" by the time of hearing.\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      In James v. Stockham Valves and Fittings Co., 559 F.2d 310, 358 (5th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1034, 98 S.Ct. 767, 54 L.Ed.2d 781 (1978), this Court stated that \"a monetary award [of front pay] is calculated to terminate on the date a victim of discrimination attains an opportunity to move to his \\'rightful place\\' rather than on the date the order granting relief is entered.\"    Further, the decision to award or deny front pay is a discretionary one, resting with the district court;  however, the court should apply an appropriate analysis for Title VII cases, inquiring if the award will aid in ending illegal discrimination.    Shore, 777 F.2d at 1159.  The Shore case defined front pay as follows:\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      Front pay has been defined as \\'an affirmative order designed to compensate the plaintiff for economic losses that have not occurred as of the date of the court decree, but that may occur as the plaintiff works toward his or her rightful place.\\'\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      Id. at 1158 (quoting Note, Front Pay--Prophylactic Relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 29 Vand.L.Rev. 211, 212 (1976)).\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      Since we conclude today that Sellers was not obligated under her duty to mitigate damages to remain in her position at Gulf, the magistrate abused his discretion by premising his denial of front pay on the basis of Sellers\\' failure to do something we have determined she had no legal duty to do.  Furthermore, our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the position at Gulf was not comparable to that at Delgado in terms of salary and promotional opportunities;  therefore, Sellers could not have achieved her \"rightful place\" by remaining in that position in any event.\\n    \\n    D. Attorney\\'s Fees\\n    \\n      43\\n      In regard to the consolidated appeal of the award of attorney\\'s fees, Sellers asserts that the magistrate erred in awarding her attorney\\'s fees at a lower hourly rate than that requested by Sellers\\' counsel.  Specifically, the magistrate reduced Sellers\\' requested hourly rate for attorney\\'s fees from $150 per hour to $125 per hour for in-court time and $100 per hour for out-of-court time.  The magistrate reasoned that the hourly rate requested by Sellers was somewhat higher than rates which had been routinely awarded by the court for such services in the past.  The magistrate recognized that Sellers\\' attorney, George Strickler, is a qualified and distinguished litigator with expertise in the field of employment discrimination.  Such a factor has been approved by this Court as appropriate in a determination of an award of attorney\\'s fees.    See Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 718-19 (5th Cir.1974).  Nevertheless, a district court is also expressly permitted by Johnson to consider awards in similar cases as well.  A district court may determine the award \"in the light of awards made in similar litigation within and without the court\\'s circuit.\"    Id. at 719.  \"While specific findings ... involve fact determinations reversible under the clearly erroneous standard ..., the ultimate determination of the amount of the award [of attorney\\'s fees] is a matter within the sound discretion of the district court.\"    Brantley v. Surles, 804 F.2d 321, 327 (5th Cir.1986).5   Applying the above standard, we cannot say the magistrate erred in his award of attorney\\'s fees.\\n    \\n    \\n      44\\n      For the reasons cited, we vacate the magistrate\\'s judgment awarding Sellers back pay, denying front pay, and denying prejudgment interest.  Accordingly, we remand for a redetermination of the damages issue not inconsistent with this opinion.  Finally, we affirm the magistrate\\'s award of attorney\\'s fees.\\n    \\n    \\n      45\\n      VACATED AND REMANDED;  AWARD OF ATTORNEY\\'S FEES AFFIRMED\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        *\\n         Circuit Judge of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         In this respect, Sec. 706(g) provides, in pertinent part, that \"[i]nterim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable.\"\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         We note that, in seeking to reduce Sellers\\' back pay award, Delgado maintains that a Title VII claimant, who over an extended period of time is unable to find comparable employment, must eventually \"lower his sights\" and mitigate losses by accepting noncomparable but suitable employment.  However, a careful analysis of the cases relied on by Delgado in this regard reveals that the opinions do not adopt a rule which would require claimants who accept noncomparable employment to remain in those positions despite dissatisfaction.  Rather, the cases promulgate a rule which guards against claimants sitting idle and doing nothing, not against those individuals who periodically accept interim inferior employment, but leave that employment at a later date to seek comparable employment.    See Brady v. Thurston Motor Lines, 753 F.2d 1269, 1273 (4th Cir.1985);  NLRB v. Madison Courier, Inc., 472 F.2d 1307, 1320-21 (D.C.Cir.1972);  NLRB v. Southern Silk Mills, 242 F.2d 697, 700 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 821, 78 S.Ct. 28, 2 L.Ed.2d 37 (1957).  In the instant case, Sellers did \"lower her sights\" by accepting temporary clerical work, the initial position at Gulf and the position as \"biscuit instructor\" at Popeye\\'s\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Specifically, the magistrate cited what it believed to be Sellers\\' continual attempts to seek jobs for which she was not qualified, her failure to place advertisements, and to contact private agencies.  The court also believed Sellers\\' resignation from her position at Gulf, a position which we believe not comparable to her position at Delgado, to be a significant factor to the weakening of her job prospects for the future\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         Due to our disposition vacating the back pay award and directing the magistrate to make further and more specific findings, we do not address Delgado\\'s remaining contentions on cross-appeal challenging the magistrate\\'s award of back pay\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         Delgado also complains of the award of attorney\\'s fees, contending that the magistrate erred in awarding Sellers attorney\\'s fees for all of the time expended by her attorney.

JONES, Circuit Judge:\\n    \\n    \\n      1\\n      Dr. Diana Rathjen, a specialist in industrial organizational psychology, was hired by the City of Houston in 1979 and shortly afterward promoted to Assistant Director of Personnel.  In early 1983 she accepted a voluntary demotion to the post of Senior Personnel Administrator, and her working conditions continued to deteriorate after she filed this lawsuit protesting her demotion.  Based on her claims of a procedural due process violation and retaliation for exercise of first amendment rights, a jury awarded her $5,000 actual damages and $25,000 punitive damages against Houston\\'s Personnel Director Barbara Litchfield, who was responsible for the demotion and retaliation for which Rathjen filed suit.  The court ordered equitable reinstatement of Rathjen to her former position.1   Raising numerous issues pertaining to the trial court\\'s judgment in favor of Rathjen, the City of Houston appeals.  We reverse.\\n    \\n    I. BACKGROUND\\n    \\n      2\\n      We condense the lengthy series of events that underlie this action to those most pertinent for analysis.  As Assistant Director of Personnel, Dr. Rathjen was in charge of research, career development, compensation and salary administration for the City of Houston.  Her peer, defendant Joe Weikerth, was responsible for hiring, workers compensation and safety.  Barbara Litchfield was employed by the City in October, 1982.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Rathjen and Litchfield immediately began discussing the EEOC and Title VII implications of using subjective interviews as opposed to testing to fill promotional opportunities with the City.  These discussions led to unanticipated controversy during Rathjen\\'s appearance before City Council on December 1, 1982, for the routine matter of requesting a room for the test for promotion within the city\\'s Finance and Administration Department.  Litchfield directed Dr. Rathjen not to discuss any policy matters or past practices and to talk with City Council only about reserving the room for this test.  During the meeting, however, two black members of City Council protested the scheduling of the test and vigorously complained that the Finance and Administration Department had not provided equal employment opportunity in the past.  Dr. Rathjen refused to answer questions on this subject, and the council members became even angrier.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      As a result of this mishap, Dr. Rathjen was summoned to the mayor\\'s office and reprimanded for her performance.  One month later, Litchfield asked her to accept a voluntary demotion involving a 10% pay cut.  Litchfield and the Mayor had approved this demotion during December.  The position to which she was proposed to be demoted required only a bachelor\\'s degree and one year work experience, compared to Dr. Rathjen\\'s doctorate degree and eleven years of experience including service on the Rice University faculty.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Dr. Rathjen steadfastly refused to accept voluntary demotion, and at some point she was informed that steps were being taken toward involuntary demotion.  She obtained able counsel, who requested negotiations with Litchfield.  The jury found that an oral agreement was reached between the parties, whereby Rathjen accepted a form of voluntary demotion.  Rather than suffer a 10% pay cut, her salary was reduced by a token amount, and she agreed to report to Joe Weikerth.  She contends that Litchfield also agreed to continue making available to her a city automobile, a secretary, and a staff assistant with the title \"Personnel Specialist,\" and that she would remove a letter from Rathjen\\'s personnel file alleging poor performance.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      The jury found, however, that Rathjen\\'s concessions to Litchfield were unsuccessful.  Resolving hotly contested evidentiary disputes, the jury found that Litchfield did not intend to keep her promises and that the promises were made in order to induce Rathjen to give up her rights to a fair hearing.  The voluntary demotion and accompanying terms of agreement became effective as of February 17, 1983.  Nevertheless, Rathjen testified that Litchfield never complied with the non-monetary aspects of their agreement, and that she became aware of the breach within only six months after the \"settlement.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      Moreover, Rathjen\\'s ability to function successfully within her department continued to be hampered.  Prior to Litchfield\\'s arrival as City Personnel Director, Rathjen had received consistently favorable employment evaluations.  After her voluntary demotion, however, Rathjen\\'s evaluations deteriorated based on complaints of communication difficulties, low productivity, lack of imagination and similar matters.  On at least two occasions, Rathjen employed city civil service procedures which permitted formal grievance over these evaluations.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Houston\\'s municipal financial woes eventually required a layoff of Rathjen, which was averted only when the district court, after the jury ruled in her favor, ordered equitable reinstatement to her earlier position as Assistant Personnel Director.\\n    \\n    II. DUE PROCESS VIOLATION\\n    \\n      9\\n      As has been noted, the jury found that Litchfield made promises to Dr. Rathjen with the intent to breach them, in order to induce her to forego a fair hearing over her demotion.  On the strength of this finding, the trial court entered judgment for Dr. Rathjen and denied the city\\'s motion for judgment n.o.v., holding that these actions deliberately and fraudulently breached her right to procedural due process.  Although the parties dispute the sufficiency of evidence to sustain the jury verdict, the fundamental question is whether, assuming the validity of the finding, it sustains a procedural due process claim.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      A few verities preface our analysis.  Dr. Rathjen, a tenured city employee, had a constitutionally protected property interest in her position as Assistant Personnel Director.  Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).  The Fourteenth Amendment\\'s due process clause has been held to require \"some kind of hearing\" before she could be deprived of that interest by termination or demotion.  Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 545, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1495, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).  Our court has additionally stated that a due process violation exists where an employee is constructively discharged by actions of the employer intended to force the employee to sacrifice his due process protection by voluntarily resigning.  Fowler v. Carrollton Public Library, 799 F.2d 976 (5th Cir.1986);  Findeisen v. Northeast Independent School Dist., 749 F.2d 234 (5th Cir.1984), cert. denied 471 U.S. 1125, 105 S.Ct. 2657, 86 L.Ed.2d 274 (1985);  Bueno v. City of Donna, 714 F.2d 484 (5th Cir.1983).\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      According to Rathjen, this case follows directly in the path of the constructive discharge due process cases.  Litchfield had no authority to demote her without a hearing.  By entering into a settlement agreement with Litchfield, Dr. Rathjen says she agreed to forebear pursuing a grievance hearing through the City Civil Service Commission.2   This agreement was, however, fraudulently induced by Litchfield.  Dr. Rathjen characterizes the City\\'s defense as implying that even though it could not demote her without a fair hearing it could do so if Dr. Rathjen failed to ask for the hearing because of fraudulent representations.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Several subtle flaws burden this argument, even acknowledging, as we must, the soundness of the pertinent jury finding.  Dr. Rathjen testified several times that she was fully aware of the City\\'s employee grievance procedures and that these allowed her to contest virtually any \"injustice.\"    She believed as early as July 1983, that Litchfield was not living up to their agreement.  She was aware that she had the right to file a grievance over this breach of faith and potentially to obtain full reinstatement from the City Civil Service Commission.  Neither then nor later, however, did she ever pursue a grievance concerning the settlement agreement.3   Instead, she filed this lawsuit in December 1984.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      The availability of a grievance and hearing procedure which would have enabled Dr. Rathjen to contest the circumstances of her voluntary demotion or her unsuccessful settlement agreement renders this a different case from our constructive discharge cases.  Those cases rested on the premise that once an employee has voluntarily resigned, no procedural remedy is available from his former employer.  Indeed, in Fowler, 799 F.2d at 979, and Findeisen, 749 F.2d at 236, the employees sought but did not obtain post-termination hearings.  Those employees, by voluntarily resigning, lost any due process protections they would otherwise have had, but Dr. Rathjen never made such a sacrifice.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Technically, Dr. Rathjen\\'s right to insist upon a hearing before demotion was thwarted when her voluntary demotion was procured by fraud.  This is a judgment rendered purely in hindsight, however, for if Litchfield had carried through with her promises, the settlement would have been satisfactory to Dr. Rathjen.  We should be reluctant to discourage compromise of public employer-employee disputes by suggesting that whenever such a dispute is resolved informally in order to forestall formal hearing procedures, the failure of this process to satisfy the employee automatically threatens a procedural due process violation.  Rather, we must consider the acts that follow the parties\\' informal agreement and the procedural remedies then available.  Here, Dr. Rathjen admitted that she could have pursued a grievance against the City of Houston for Litchfield\\'s failure to comply with their agreement.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      This circumstance causes the case to fall within our recent jurisprudence holding that no denial of procedural due process occurs where a person has failed to utilize the state procedures available to him.  In Myrick v. City of Dallas, 810 F.2d 1382 (5th Cir.1987), an employee fired by the City questioned the adequacy of her post-deprivation remedies, although she did not attempt to pursue them.  We held:\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Of course, she was free to skip state remedies and proceed directly to federal court to vindicate state deprivation of her constitutional right;  exhaustion of remedies is not ordinarily required.  But she cannot skip an available state remedy and then argue that the deprivation by the state was the inadequacy or lack of the skipped remedy.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      Id. at 1388.    In Galloway v. State of Louisiana, 817 F.2d 1154 (5th Cir.1987), an employee afforded a pre-termination hearing did not attend the hearing because he was in the hospital.  Later, rather than request a hearing, he bypassed the administrative procedure for an investigation alternative.  We rejected his procedural due process claim, holding that \"an employee cannot ignore the process duly extended to him and later complain that he was not accorded due process.\"    Id. at 1158.    Most recently, in Pope v. Mississippi Real Estate Commission, 872 F.2d 127 (5th Cir.1989), we rebuffed a challenge to rulings or interpretations of the Commission\\'s regulations, where the plaintiff had sought no administrative or state court remedy that was statutorily available.4\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Because Dr. Rathjen had a readily accessible administrative remedy as soon as she believed Litchfield had defaulted on their settlement agreement, this case also appears to fall within the purview of Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984).  The evident purpose behind the City\\'s employee grievance procedures is to facilitate prompt remedies for perceived injustices or unfairness.  To the extent Litchfield\\'s deceptive offer of settlement or her failure to live up to the informal agreement were \"random, unauthorized acts\" contrary to city personnel guidelines, Dr. Rathjen had an adequate post-deprivation remedy.  See Schaper v. City of Huntsville, 813 F.2d 709 (5th Cir.1987) (alleged bias in pretermination hearing did not cause due process violation because (1) it resulted from \"random unauthorized act\" of city officials and (2) administrative post-termination remedy was available).\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      We would finally note that other circuits have refused to entertain procedural due process claims of employees who did not avail themselves of administrative hearing procedures.  Riggins v. Bd. of Regents, 790 F.2d 707, 711-12 (8th Cir.1986);  Dwyer v. Regan, 777 F.2d 825, 834-35 (2d Cir.1985), modified on other grounds, 793 F.2d 457 (2d Cir.1986);  Dusanek v. Hannon, 677 F.2d 538, 543 (7th Cir.) cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1017, 103 S.Ct. 379, 74 L.Ed.2d 512 (1982);  Correa v. Nampa School Dist. No. 131, 645 F.2d 814, 817 (9th Cir.1981).\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      Accepting Dr. Rathjen\\'s argument in this case would lead to untoward consequences.  Although Perry v. Sinderman, 408 U.S. 593, 603, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2700, 33 L.Ed.2d 570, 580 (1972) holds only that an employee is entitled to a hearing if he requests one, the district court\\'s theory virtually compels the parties to resort to a hearing in any case where adverse personnel action may be contemplated.  This is because any informal settlement carries the potential claim for denial of procedural due process if an employee becomes unhappy with the terms of the settlement.  Second, adoption of Rathjen\\'s theory would encourage employees who resign or accept demotions to file federal lawsuits rather than pursue available administrative remedies.  Third, a rule providing that employees who are \"tricked\" into resigning or accepting a demotion need not request an available hearing would give that class of employees arguably greater rights than those who are dealt with involuntarily and must request a hearing.  Thus, notwithstanding the jury\\'s finding that Dr. Rathjen was fraudulently induced to accept a voluntary demotion, we cannot hold that she was deprived of a constitutional right to procedural due process because she failed to resort to the city\\'s grievance procedure for a remedy.\\n    \\n    III. RETALIATION CLAIM\\n    \\n      21\\n      The district court entered judgment against Litchfield on Rathjen\\'s claim that Litchfield inaccurately evaluated her performance because she had opposed her demotion and filed this lawsuit.5   Litchfield appeals the district court\\'s refusal to grant her motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on essentially two grounds:  (1) that there was insufficient admissible evidence that Litchfield was involved in any inaccurate evaluation of Rathjen;  and (2) that Rathjen\\'s activity in opposing her demotion and filing this lawsuit are not \"protected activities\" under the first amendment of the United States Constitution or 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981.  We pretermit discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence because the activities identified in Jury Question Number 5 do not give rise to a federal retaliation claim.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      The Supreme Court has instructed that the first amendment prohibits a government employer from taking actions which were designed to \"suppress the rights of public employees [to] participat[e] in public affairs.\"    Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 145-46, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 1689, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983).  Yet, in Connick, the Court also established that the first amendment does not prevent a government employer from taking action in response to an employee\\'s expression that does not touch upon a matter of public concern:\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Pickering [v. Bd. of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968) ], its antecedents, and its progeny lead us to conclude that if [the plaintiff\\'s actions] cannot be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern, it is unnecessary for us to scrutinize the reasons for her discharge.  When employee expression cannot be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community, government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices, without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      103 S.Ct. at 1690 (footnote omitted).  The Court noted that \"[p]erhaps the government employer\\'s dismissal of the worker may not be fair,\" but that that did not ordinarily violate the constitution and subject the employment decision to judicial review.  Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      Relying on Connick, we have held that, \"the courts will not interfere with personnel decisions \\'when a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest.\\' \"    Page v. DeLaune, 837 F.2d 233, 237 (5th Cir.1988).  See also Day v. South Park Independent School Dist., 768 F.2d 696, 700 (5th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1101, 106 S.Ct. 883, 88 L.Ed.2d 918 (1986).  In Terrell v. Univ. of Texas System Police, 792 F.2d 1360, 1362 (5th Cir.1986), we stated that another test was \"to decide whether the speech at issue in a particular case was made primarily in the plaintiff\\'s role as a citizen or primarily in the plaintiff\\'s role as employee.\"    (footnote omitted), cert. denied 479 U.S. 1064, 107 S.Ct. 948, 93 L.Ed.2d 997 (1987).  The question in this case is whether Rathjen\\'s opposition to her demotion or her filing of this lawsuit are \"matters of public concern\" or are \"matters only of personal interest.\"6   Rathjen\\'s speech and actions fall in the latter category.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      The law is no different where the act which allegedly gave rise to the retaliation claim is the filing of a grievance or a lawsuit.  Brinkmeyer v. Thrall Independent School Dist., 786 F.2d 1291, 1296 (5th Cir.1986);  Day, 768 F.2d at 701-02.    The facts of Day are quite similar to the facts of this case and are dispositive of Rathjen\\'s retaliation claim.  In Day, an untenured school teacher alleged that her contract was not renewed because \"she complained about her [principal\\'s unfavorable] performance evaluation and [later] filed a grievance.\"    Id. at 697.    We affirmed the district court\\'s conclusion that \"her actions, whether viewed as speech, petitioning, or both, related only to her superior\\'s employment decisions that affected her in a purely personal manner, not to matters of political, social, or community concern.\"    Id.  Day forecloses a constitutional basis for Dr. Rathjen\\'s retaliation claim.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      Rathjen alternatively turns to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 in pursuit of a federal right.  However, Sec. 1981 is equally barren.  Section 1981 is a civil rights statute which \"prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts.\"    Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 405 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989).  We have also held that Sec. 1981 protects employees from retaliation in response to an employee\\'s EEOC charge or civil rights suit alleging racial discrimination.  Goff v. Continental Oil Co., 678 F.2d 593, 598 (5th Cir.1982).  See also Irby v. Sullivan, 737 F.2d 1418, 1430 n. 22 (5th Cir.1984).  Even if Goff and Irby survive Patterson, id. --- U.S. at ----, 109 S.Ct. at 2372-73 (excluding from Sec. 1981 coverage an employer\\'s post-contract formation conduct), Rathjen could not allege that retaliation was taken in response to a racial discrimination claim she filed because she never filed such a claim.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      Rathjen\\'s attempt to renew her claim that she was injured because she opposed the use of subjective criteria in minority hiring fails for two reasons.  First, the jury found otherwise.  More importantly, her retaliation claim has nothing to do with her opinion on the subject.  Accordingly, we must reverse the judgment for Rathjen on her retaliation claim against Litchfield.  Since we reverse on the due process claim and the retaliation claim, we need not address either Litchfield\\'s right to qualified immunity, or the city\\'s objection to an award of attorneys\\' fees that included services rendered by Dr. Rathjen\\'s counsel in certain administrative proceedings.\\n    \\n    IV. APPELLEE\\'S CROSS-POINTS\\n    \\n      29\\n      Dr. Rathjen cross-appealed two issues:  the trial court\\'s failure to enter judgment on the jury verdict awarding $25,000 in punitive damages against the Mayor of Houston;  and its rejection of a motion for new trial on Rathjen\\'s first amendment claim.  The first issue is wholly unsustainable, because the jury found no basis for liability against the mayor, and liability is a sine qua non of a damage award.  Likewise, the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in failing to grant a new trial on an issue decided adversely to Rathjen by the jury and supported by the evidence.  Conway v. Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, 610 F.2d 360, 363 (5th Cir.1980).\\n    \\n    V. CONCLUSION\\n    \\n      30\\n      For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the judgment on the due process and retaliation claims and REMAND this action to the district court for proceedings in accordance herewith.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         Our resolution of the case makes it unnecessary to decide whether the district court had authority to order equitable reinstatement of Dr. Rathjen as a remedy for a procedural due process violation.  But see Perry v. Sinderman, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2700, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972);  Neuwirth v. Louisiana State Board of Dentistry, 845 F.2d 553, 559 n. 12 (5th Cir.1988) (\"another hearing ... is the remedy for due process violations ...\")\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         Rathjen acknowledged at trial that she was aware that she had a right to a hearing before the City Civil Service Commission to contest an involuntary demotion.  See Footnote 3, infra\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         On cross-examination, Rathjen testified as follows in response to defense counsel questioning:\\n        Q And I would assume, Dr. Rathjen, that since you had been in the Personnel Department for a number of years that you were fairly familiar with the Civil Service Rules,--\\n        A Yes.\\n        Q --Is that correct?\\n        A Yes.\\n        Q Were you aware, specifically, that--what the Civil Service Rule provisions were regarding involuntary demotion?\\n        A Yes.\\n        Q And you were aware that you did have a right to a hearing?\\n        A For an involuntary demotion, yes.\\n        Q And in fact, Dr. Rathjan, there\\'s also some other provisions in the Civil Service Rules, one in particular regarding grievances.  You are, obviously, familiar with that particular provision, is that correct?\\n        A Yes.  I\\'m familiar with the grievances.\\n        Q Are you aware that there is also a civil service rule which permits the Civil Service Commission at any time to investigate any unfairness or injustice in the city civil service system?\\n        A Yes.\\n        * * *\\n        Q Now, in this lawsuit, you\\'re claiming that Ms. Litchfield has made some promises to you which you\\'re alleging that she broke.  At any time have you filed a grievance regarding the breaking of those particular [promises] ...?\\n        A No.\\n        Q And you never sought Civil Service Commission review of these purported breaches of Ms. Litchfield\\'s promises, have you?\\n        A No.\\n        Q You were fully aware that you had the right to do that?\\n        A Yes.\\n        Q And you were also aware that under Section 14-189, which we\\'ve discussed previously, that if the Commission found that there was merit to a claim that an employee had been treated unfairly that the Commission could order the employee reinstated in their position or may hold or basically correct the unfairness?    You\\'re aware that that is a provision of the Commission\\'s investigatory powers, weren\\'t you?\\n        A Yes.\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         The City cites In re Selcraig, 705 F.2d 789 (5th Cir.1983) in its favor.  We find Selcraig distinguishable at least in part.  First, the plaintiff in Selcraig \"[did] not request[ ] a hearing since his resignation, nor [did] he formally ask[ ] that his resignation be withdrawn.\"    The court relied on this fact in ruling that \"he has not shown any factual basis for his charge that he has been denied a hearing at any time.\"    705 F.2d at 797.    Moreover, in holding that an employee\\'s due process rights are not violated when he fails to request an available due process hearing, Selcraig qualified this statement by the caveat that this is true \"unless he can set aside the waiver contained in his resignation ...\" 705 F.2d at 797.    That, of course, is precisely what Dr. Rathjen did here\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         Jury Question Number 4 asked:  \"Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that Defendants [Weikerth and Litchfield] inaccurately evaluated Plaintiff\\'s performance?\"    The jury answered yes as to both defendants.  The district court overruled defendants\\' objection to the disjunctive form of Jury Question Number 5.  Because neither activity gives rise to a federal retaliation claim, the form of the question is irrelevant.  Jury Question Number 5 asked:  \"Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that Plaintiffs\\' opposition to her demotion or the filing of this lawsuit, or both, were a substantial motivating factor in Defendant[s\\'] inaccurately evaluating Plaintiff\\'s performance?\"    The jury answered yes as to Litchfield only\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         Rathjen argues that her discussion of subjective criteria in the evaluation of minority applicants for city jobs is a matter of public concern.  That discussion, however, is not the basis of Rathjen\\'s retaliation claim.

The First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, granted summary judgment in\\n\\nfavor of the City and Moore. We affirm.\\n\\n\u00b63      We restate the issues raised by McGinnis on appeal as follows:\\n\\n\u00b64      1. Whether the District Court erred by granting summary judgment on the issues of breach\\nof contract; wrongful discharge; and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\\n\\n\u00b65     2. Whether the District Court erred by concluding that McGinnis waived his right to an\\nappeal before the police commission by failing to submit a written appeal when evidence showed\\nwhat Moore told McGinnis that an appeal was not available.\\n\\n                      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\\n\\n\u00b66     Ronald McGinnis served as the chief of the East Helena police force from 1982 until his\\n\\ndischarge from employment in September 1995. During this period, the East Helena police\\n\\ndepartment consisted of four full-time officers. To provide round-the-clock coverage, each 24-hour\\n\\nperiod was divided into three 8-hour shifts, with one officer assigned to each shift. As the chief,\\n\\nMcGinnis worked the 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. shift and usually was the only officer on duty during\\n\\n\\n                                                  2\\n\\x0cthose hours. Part-time, reserve officers filled in as needed to cover vacation and sick leave.\\n\\n\u00b67     Medical problems plagued McGinnis during the last years of his employment with the City.\\n\\nAs McGinnis described in his application for disability retirement benefits, which was approved in\\n\\nDecember 1995, he had surgery on his left shoulder in 1990; knee replacement surgery in 1993; a\\n\\nbleeding ulcer; and a life-threatening staph infection. These infirmities required him to adjust his\\n\\nwork schedule and to take an extended medical leave. For example, following the knee surgery in\\n\\nNovember 1993, McGinnis worked part-time for a few months and resumed a full-time schedule for\\n\\nonly a few weeks before cutting back to part-time duty again. From July 1994 until January 1995,\\n\\nMcGinnis worked full-time, but then his doctor advised him to stop working completely to allow his\\n\\nknee to recover. The City granted McGinnis a six-month medical leave beginning in February 1995.\\n\\nWhile McGinnis received no salary during the leave, the City continued to pay his health insurance\\n\\npremiums.\\n\\n\u00b68     In July 1995, as the end of the medical leave approached, McGinnis and his attorney met\\n\\nwith Mayor Larry Moore and Michael Rieley, the East Helena city attorney. McGinnis informed\\n\\nMoore and Rieley that the doctor again advised him not to return to full-time police work. Declaring\\n\\nthat he was physically unable to perform the full duties of the chief of police, McGinnis explained\\n\\nthat he did not want to put himself, the public or another police officer at risk. He requested the City\\n\\nrelieve him of patrol duty and restrict his work to the administrative tasks of the police chief\\n\\nposition, which he estimated would take about five hours each day to accomplish. McGinnis\\'s\\n\\nattorney sent Rieley a follow-up letter formally requesting that the City \u201callow Ron to work on a part\\n\\ntime basis doing principally administrative type work for the City.\u201d The letter enumerated various\\n\\ntasks that McGinnis could perform which required little physical exertion.\\n\\n\\n                                                   3\\n\\x0c\u00b69     The minutes of the City Council meeting on September 19, 1995, reveal that the Council\\n\\nunderstood McGinnis to request a reconfigured chief of police position, entailing a five-hour shift\\n\\nper day consisting solely of administrative duties. The Council recognized that the new description\\n\\nof the police chief\u2019s duties that McGinnis sought would require the City to hire another officer to\\n\\nhandle the patrol duties during McGinnis\\'s shifts. At the Council meeting, McGinnis reiterated that\\n\\nhe could no longer physically manage the patrolman functions of the job. The Council voted 3-1 to\\n\\nreject McGinnis\\'s proposal to redefine the chief of police position and established September 25,\\n\\n1995, as the date for McGinnis\\'s formal termination from City employment. Two members of the\\n\\nEast Helena police commission resigned to protest McGinnis\\'s termination and numerous East\\n\\nHelena citizens signed a petition in support of McGinnis\\'s reinstatement.\\n\\n\u00b610    Through his attorney, McGinnis notified City Attorney Rieley in early October that he\\n\\nexpected to be reinstated to an administrative position with the City \u201cby October 19, 1995, or an\\n\\naction will be filed against the City and most of the members of the City Commission.\u201d At its next\\n\\nmeeting on October 17, 1995, the City Council established an ad hoc committee composed of two\\n\\ncouncil members, the City\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity officer and the remaining member of\\n\\nthe police commission. The Council directed the committee to investigate whether a special\\n\\naccommodation could be found for McGinnis. McGinnis and his attorney were invited to attend the\\n\\ncommittee meeting but neither appeared.\\n\\n\u00b611    Weighing the duties of the East Helena police chief against the information McGinnis had\\n\\nprovided previously concerning his physical condition, the committee first determined that\\n\\nMcGinnis could not perform certain essential functions of the position. Given the small size of the\\n\\nEast Helena Police Department and the fact that only one officer was on duty at any given time, the\\n\\n\\n                                                4\\n\\x0ccommittee affirmed the Council\u2019s finding that creation of a part-time position encompassing only the\\n\\nadministrative responsibilities of the police chief would require that the City hire at least one more\\n\\nfull-time officer to cover day-time patrol duties. Due to the significant additional expense to the\\n\\nCity, the committee concluded that creation of a new position tailored to McGinnis\\'s physical\\n\\nlimitations was not a reasonable accommodation. The City Council unanimously accepted the ad\\n\\nhoc committee\u2019s conclusions on November 21, 1995.\\n\\n\u00b612    McGinnis initiated his action on September 24, 1998. He sued the City of East Helena and\\n\\nLarry Moore, the former mayor, in five counts. The claims encompassed allegations of retaliatory\\n\\ndiscrimination, including various claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans With\\n\\nDisabilities Act, and provisions for certain injured Montana police officers, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 7-32-\\n\\n4132 and 4136, MCA; as well as claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress; intentional\\n\\ninfliction of emotional distress; breach of an employment contract; and wrongful discharge. After\\n\\nthe close of discovery, the City and Moore moved for summary judgment on all counts, which the\\n\\nDistrict Court granted on December 21, 2000. McGinnis seeks review of the summary dismissal on\\n\\nfour of the five counts.\\n\\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n\u00b613    The standard of review for a grant of summary judgment is de novo. This Court will apply\\n\\nthe same evaluation as the district court based upon Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. The moving party bears\\n\\nthe burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Bruner v. Yellowstone\\n\\nCounty (1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. Once the moving party has established the\\n\\nabsence of a genuine issue of material fact in light of the substantive law of the case, the burden\\n\\nshifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine\\n\\n\\n                                                  5\\n\\x0cissue does exist. Bruner, 272 Mont. at 264, 900 P.2d at 903. Having determined that a genuine\\n\\nissue of material fact does not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is\\n\\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Bruner, 272 Mont. at 264, 900 P.2d at 903.\\n\\n                                            DISCUSSION\\n\\n\u00b614     Issue 1. Whether the District Court erred by granting summary judgment on the issues of\\nbreach of contract; wrongful discharge; and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional\\ndistress.\\n\\n\u00b615     McGinnis appeals for de novo review of summary judgment on four of the five counts raised\\n\\nin his Complaint. Although he presents a breach of contract claim as an issue for appeal, McGinnis\\n\\nentirely neglects to brief the matter. Our Rules of Appellate Procedure require the appellant to\\n\\npresent argument with citations to authorities, statutes and the record in respect to each issue\\n\\npresented. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. Failure to formulate arguments or locate authorities in\\n\\nsupport of a position on appeal is sufficient cause for this Court to decline to address the issue. State\\n\\nv. Blackcrow, 1999 MT 44, \u00b6 33, 293 Mont. 374, \u00b6 33, 975 P.2d 1253, \u00b6 33. Consequently, we limit\\n\\nour discussion to the summary dismissal of the wrongful discharge and the two infliction of\\n\\nemotional distress claims.\\n\\n                               Wrongful Discharge from Employment\\n\\n\u00b616     McGinnis challenges the District Court\u2019s finding that he was not able to perform the\\n\\npatrolman functions of the police chief position. Contending that a genuine issue of material fact\\n\\nexists regarding his physical ability to have performed all job duties in September 1995, McGinnis\\n\\nargues that the court erred by not acknowledging this factual dispute. If McGinnis had the capacity\\n\\nto carry out all essential functions of the police chief job, McGinnis submits a legal question arises\\n\\nas to whether the discharge was for good cause, pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-904, MCA.\\n\\n\\n                                                   6\\n\\x0c\u00b617    A discharge is wrongful under the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act only if:\\n\\n       (a) it was in retaliation for the employee\\'s refusal to violate public policy or for\\n       reporting a violation of public policy;\\n       (b) the discharge was not for good cause and the employee had completed the\\n       employer\\'s probationary period of employment; or\\n\\n       (c) the employer violated the express provisions of its own written personnel policy.\\n\\nSection 39-2-904, MCA. \u201cGood cause\u201d for discharge is defined as \u201creasonable job-related grounds\\n\\nfor dismissal based on a failure to satisfactorily perform job duties, disruption of the employer\\'s\\n\\noperation, or other legitimate business reason.\u201d Section 39-2-903(5), MCA.\\n\\n\u00b618     The record is clear that the East Helena City Council discharged McGinnis because the\\n\\nCouncil believed McGinnis was unable to perform certain essential functions of the police chief\\n\\nposition, specifically the day-time patrol duties. The Council formally considered McGinnis\\'s\\n\\nrequest for reconfigured job duties when both McGinnis and his attorney were present on September\\n\\n19, 1995. The minutes of that meeting reveal that McGinnis informed the Council that he could not\\n\\nmanage the physical demands of patrol duty and asked for reassignment to an administrative\\n\\nposition in order to accommodate his admitted physical limitations. Nothing in the record indicates\\n\\nthat McGinnis ever retracted the statements he made before the Council or that he either asked or\\n\\noffered to resume performing the police chief\u2019s job on a full-time or full-duty basis at any time after\\n\\nthe Council\u2019s decision not to redefine the duties of the position.\\n\\n\u00b619    McGinnis fails to offer any evidence to support the hypothetical proposition that he was able\\n\\nto perform all essential police chief job functions at the time of his termination from employment.\\n\\nSimilarly, he presents no evidence to indicate that his inability to physically handle patrol duty,\\n\\nwhich was the City Council\\'s stated reason for discharging him, was not a valid reason; amounted to\\n\\na mistaken interpretation of the facts; or constituted a pretext and not the honest reason for his\\n\\n                                                  7\\n\\x0cdischarge. Consequently, we hold that McGinnis has not met his burden of demonstrating the\\n\\nexistence of a genuine issue of material fact that would preclude summary judgment on the issue of\\n\\nwrongful discharge.\\n\\n                    Negligent and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\\n\\n\u00b620    The Respondents first argue that McGinnis\\'s claims for negligent or intentional infliction of\\n\\nemotional distress are barred by the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA). The\\n\\nWDEA \u201cprovides the exclusive remedy for a wrongful discharge from employment\u201d and allows that\\n\\n\u201cno claim for discharge may arise from tort or express or implied contract.\u201d Sections 39-2-902 and\\n\\n913, MCA. In construing \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, we have held that the section bars all claims arising\\n\\nfrom an asserted wrongful discharge based upon common law tort or express contract. Kneeland v.\\n\\nLuzenac America, Inc., 1998 MT 136, \u00b6 27, 289 Mont. 201, \u00b6 27, 961 P.2d 725, \u00b6 27 (citing Beasley\\n\\nv. Semitool, Inc. (1993), 258 Mont. 258, 261, 853 P.2d 84, 86). Further explicating the bar, \u00a7 39-2-\\n\\n905(3), MCA, states: \"There is no right under any legal theory to damages for wrongful discharge\\n\\nunder this part for pain and suffering [or] emotional distress . . .\" Hence, the WDEA disallows tort\\n\\nand contract claims arising from the discharge, but does not bar claims arising within the\\n\\ncircumstances of employment separate and independent from the discharge. Beasley, 258 Mont. at\\n\\n262, 853 P.2d at 86. Therefore, only to the extent that McGinnis\\'s avowed emotional distress stems\\n\\ndirectly from his termination is his tort claim precluded by the WDEA.\\n\\n\u00b621    In his deposition, McGinnis stated \u201cI\u2019ve never been fired from a job in my life.\u201d His\\n\\ntestimony continued,\\n\\n       I took pride in my work. I feel like a, and I think I said this in a television interview,\\n\\n       I felt like a race horse that as long as I was good and at the top and okay, I was fine;\\n\\n\\n                                                   8\\n\\x0c       but as soon as I wasn\u2019t able to be a hundred percent, why, I was just a piece of meat,\\n\\n       get rid of me.\u201d\\n\\nBy affidavit, McGinnis further asserted that the \u201cmayor harassed me over the course of several years\\n\\n. . . ridiculed me about my health and my physical condition. He made fun of me in front of others.\\n\\nHe embarrassed and humiliated me.\u201d\\n\\n\u00b622    First, pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, we must exclude from consideration the distress\\n\\nMcGinnis experienced as a result of the City\u2019s decision to terminate his long-term employment.\\n\\nMcGinnis\\'s lawful discharge as the East Helena chief of police and the concomitant loss of income\\n\\nand status exacted a psychic toll that our law does not recognize as compensable within the context\\n\\nof the tort claims of negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising out of a\\n\\nwrongful discharge. Therefore, we confine our analysis to the acts of harassment McGinnis\\n\\nattributed to Moore as the source from which the emotional distress claims arise.\\n\\n\u00b623    In Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, Inc. (1995), 271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411, this\\n\\nCourt held that an independent cause of action for negligent or intentional infliction of emotional\\n\\ndistress arises under circumstances where serious or severe emotional distress to the plaintiff was the\\n\\nreasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligent or intentional act or omission.\\n\\nSacco, 271 Mont. at 234 and 237, 896 P.2d at 426 and 428. We defined \u201cserious\u201d emotional distress\\n\\nas follows:\\n\\n               Emotional distress passes under various names, such as mental suffering,\\n\\n       mental anguish, mental or nervous shock, or the like. It includes all highly\\n\\n       unpleasant mental reactions, such as fright, horror, grief, shame, humiliation,\\n\\n       embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment, worry, and nausea. It is only where\\n\\n\\n                                                  9\\n\\x0c       it is extreme that the liability arises. Complete emotional tranquillity is seldom\\n\\n       attainable in this world, and some degree of transient and trivial emotional distress is\\n\\n       a part of the price of living among people. The law intervenes only where the\\n\\n       distress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable [person] could be expected to endure\\n\\n       it. The intensity and the duration of the distress are factors to be considered in\\n\\n       determining its severity.\\n\\nSacco, 271 Mont. at 234, 896 P.2d at 426 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 46, comment j).\\n\\nWe also delineated the respective roles of the court and the jury in deciding emotional distress cases\\n\\nas follows:\\n\\n              It is for the court to determine whether on the evidence severe [serious]\\n       emotional distress can be found; it is for the jury to determine whether, on the\\n       evidence, it has in fact existed.\\n\\nSacco, 271 Mont. at 233, 896 P.2d at 425 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 46, comment j).\\n\\nIn other words, the district court must determine first whether the evidence supports a finding of\\n\\nsevere emotional distress. St. John v. Missoula Elec. Co-op., Inc. (1997), 282 Mont. 315, 321, 938\\n\\nP.2d 586, 589 (citing Sacco, 271 Mont. at 239, 896 P.2d at 429). Only when the court concludes the\\n\\nevidence supports a threshold finding of distress at a level of severity defined in Sacco does a jury or\\n\\njudge then determine whether the plaintiff suffered such distress.\\n\\n\u00b624    A district court\\'s determination of whether the objective circumstances of a case present a\\n\\nlevel of emotional distress that meets the Sacco definition of severity is a mixed question of law and\\n\\nfact. Our standard of review of a conclusion of law on a mixed question of law and fact is whether\\n\\nthe determination is correct. Butterfield v. Sidney Public Schools, 2001 MT 177, \u00b6 38, 306 Mont.\\n\\n179, \u00b6 38, 32 P.3d 1243, \u00b6 38 (citing Maquire v. State (1999), 254 Mont. 178, 182, 835 P.2d 755,\\n\\n\\n                                                  10\\n\\x0c757-58). Measuring this element requires a careful consideration of the circumstances under which\\n\\nthe infliction occurs and the relationship of the parties involved in order to determine when and\\n\\nwhere a reasonable person should or should not have to endure certain kinds of emotional distress.\\n\\nMaloney v. Home and Investment Center, Inc., 2000 MT 34, \u00b6 63, 298 Mont. 213, \u00b6 63, 994 P.2d\\n\\n1124, \u00b6 63.\\n\\n\u00b625    The District Court, in this case, found that \"a reasonable person could likely endure the type\\n\\nof harassment alleged by McGinnis\" and that the distress McGinnis experienced was of the\\n\\n\u201ctransient or trivial\u201d type that is a part of the cost of living with people. The court also noted that\\n\\nthere is no evidence in the record that McGinnis suffered any actual mental damage as a result of\\n\\nMoore\u2019s actions.\\n\\n\u00b626    While the question of whether McGinnis actually suffered severe emotional distress is a\\n\\nseparate inquiry to be undertaken by a jury subsequent to the court\\'s determination that the evidence\\n\\nsupports a finding of severe emotional distress, mental anguish that requires psychological treatment\\n\\nand results from inflicted emotional distress might well support such a finding. McGinnis asserts\\n\\nthat the District Court ignored testimony that he has taken anti-depressant medication and has\\n\\nremained under the care of a psychiatrist since his 1993 knee surgery due to Moore\u2019s harassment.\\n\\n\u00b627    The following exchange occurred during McGinnis\u2019s deposition:\\n\\n       Q. [Attorney for Respondents] Did you seek medical help for this emotional distress?\\n\\n       A. [McGinnis] Yes, I did.\\n\\n       Q. Who did you see?\\n\\n       A. I first seen Dr. Samply. I talked to Dr. Hunter. I was in the hospital, and Dr.\\n       Hunter brought in Dr. Samply.\\n\\n       Q. What kind of doctor is he?\\n\\n                                                  11\\n\\x0c       A. Psychiatrist.\\n\\n       Q. When was this?\\n\\n       A. This was in November of \u201894, \u201893.\\n\\n       Q. This was when you were still --\\n\\n       A. When I had my knee replaced.\\n\\n       Q. When you were still working there [at the police department]?\\n\\n       A. Yeah, it was when I had my knee replacement. I was on the verge of a\\n       breakdown.\\n\\n       Q. Because of your knee replacement?\\n\\n       A. No, because of all the things that had been happening to me, the injuries, the\\n       harassment.\\n\\n       Q. What harassment?\\n\\n       A. The things that I\u2019ve told you about.\\n\\n       Q. Those three incidents?\\n\\n       A. That\u2019s all I remember off the top of my head. There were more than that . . .\\n\\n\u00b628    The three acts of harassment McGinnis described in his deposition include Moore making\\n\\ndisparaging remarks about McGinnis\\'s weight and calling him a \"fat S.O.B.\"; challenging McGinnis\\n\\nto ride a bicycle; and telling another officer that McGinnis \"was just an accident looking for a place\\n\\nto happen.\" By affidavit, McGinnis submitted a hand-written list of other incidents of harassment\\n\\nperpetrated by Moore between November 1993 and September 1995. After McGinnis returned to\\n\\nwork following surgery and had to reduce his daily working hours from eight to five on his doctor\\'s\\n\\nadvice, Moore allegedly accused him of exaggerating his infirmities and pressured him to return to\\n\\nfull-time status by threatening to demote him from the chief position. McGinnis also claimed that\\n\\n                                                 12\\n\\x0cMoore threatened to refuse to sign his paychecks if McGinnis assigned a reserve officer more than\\n\\neight hours of duty during any two-week pay period. McGinnis reported that Moore harassed him\\n\\nprivately by blowing cigarette smoke into his car and commenting that \u201cthere\u2019s not much to hurt up\\n\\nthere anyway\u201d after McGinnis accidentally bumped his head. Publicly, Moore humiliated him by\\n\\nsaying at an office party: \"Hey, McGinnis, you don\\'t need to eat that--your stomach is big enough\\n\\nalready.\"   Although Moore denied some of these alleged acts, this Court will presume the\\n\\nallegations to be true for our review on summary judgment.\\n\\n\u00b629    Do such threats and insults inflict \u201cserious and severe\u201d emotional distress? According to\\n\\nMcGinnis\u2019s recounting, the incidents occurred sporadically over a two-year period and, thus, did not\\n\\nconstitute an intense barrage. Threats of demotion and wage withholding appear to have been idle,\\n\\none-time events. The relationship between the parties is an important consideration, especially to\\n\\ndecipher the meaning of ridicule or sarcasm when taken out-of-context and reduced to writing.\\n\\nMoore re-appointed McGinnis as the chief of police while McGinnis was on medical leave\\n\\nfollowing his knee surgery in 1993. McGinnis testified that he and Moore were \u201cvery friendly\u201d a\\n\\nyear later in November 1994 but that \u201cthings had begun to deteriorate.\u201d The record does not reveal\\n\\nwhen Moore\u2019s needling lost its humor. McGinnis testified that he sought psychiatric help in 1993,\\n\\nin part, because of the harassment by Moore. However, he presented no evidence to connect his\\n\\npsychological treatment to underlying causes related to the alleged harassment. Consequently, while\\n\\nMoore may have behaved in a manner inconsiderate and unkind, we are not persuaded that he\\n\\ncreated severe distress that was the source of McGinnis\u2019s psychiatric condition.\\n\\n\u00b630    We have observed that \"there is no occasion for the law to intervene in every case where\\n\\nsome one\\'s feelings are hurt.\" Maloney, \u00b6 66 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 46,\\n\\n\\n                                                13\\n\\x0ccomment d).     We conclude that McGinnis did not meet his burden of demonstrating that the\\n\\nenumerated threats and insults engendered the type of \u201cserious and severe\u201d emotional distress that\\n\\nwarrants legal redress.\\n\\n\u00b631    We hold that the District Court completed an appropriate evaluation of the evidence to\\n\\ndetermine whether severe emotional distress could be found and, finding none, correctly dismissed\\n\\nMcGinnis\\'s claims of negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress as a matter of law for\\n\\nwant of a prima facie showing.\\n\\n\u00b632    Issue 2. Whether the District Court erred by concluding that McGinnis waived his right to an\\nappeal before the police commission by failing to submit a written appeal when evidence showed\\nwhat Moore told McGinnis that an appeal was not available.\\n\\n\u00b633    McGinnis testified that Moore told him that his termination was final and that an appeal to\\n\\nthe East Helena police commission was useless. McGinnis maintains that it was reasonable for him\\n\\nto believe that he had no right to bring an appeal before the police commission due to Moore\u2019s\\n\\nsuperior position as the City\u2019s chief law enforcement officer. The District Court found that\\n\\nMcGinnis, as the chief of police, was in a position to know that he nevertheless had a statutory right\\n\\nto appeal his discharge to the commission. Because McGinnis did not submit a written appeal, the\\n\\ncourt concluded that he failed to exercise his right to a hearing before the police commission.\\n\\nMcGinnis claims that he was denied his right to appeal the City\\'s failure to consider an alternative\\n\\nwork schedule for him and his termination due to Moore\\'s inaccurate statement.\\n\\n\u00b634    Section 7-32-4151, MCA, requires every city to have a police commission. A member of the\\n\\npolice force who is disciplined, suspended, removed, or discharged has a right of appeal to the police\\n\\ncommission. Section 7-32-4164, MCA. The commission\u2019s duty is to hear and decide appeals, \u00a7 7-\\n\\n32-4155(1), MCA, and it has the power to sustain, modify, or overrule a disciplinary order of the\\n\\n\\n                                                 14\\n\\x0cmayor, \u00a7 7-32-4160, MCA. The following procedure is required to bring an appeal:\\n\\n        An appeal brought by any member of the police force must be in writing in the form\\n        required by the police commission, and a copy must be served upon the mayor, city\\n        manager, or chief executive at least 30 days before the time fixed for the hearing of\\n        the appeal.\\n\\nSection 7-32-4156, MCA.\\n\\n\u00b635     McGinnis argues that his employer\u2019s inaccurate statement that an appeal to the police\\n\\ncommission was useless relieved him of his obligation to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 7-32-\\n\\n4156, MCA. However, he cites no authority for his conclusion, nor does he explain why he, as the\\n\\nchief of police, should not be held to know the requirements of this law--one which pertains\\n\\nspecifically to his job. Moreover, at the time when the City Council discharged him from\\n\\nemployment, McGinnis was represented by counsel, who was in a position to advise him regarding\\n\\nhis legal rights.\\n\\n\u00b636     In passing, we note that we have held that an employer is not shielded from a wrongful\\n\\ndischarge suit by a provision of the WDEA that requires exhaustion of internal grievance procedures\\n\\nprior to filing a district court action when the employer fails to provide the employee with a written\\n\\ncopy of the internal procedures in a timely manner. Casiano v. Greenway Enterprises, Inc., 2002\\n\\nMT 93, \u00b6 21, 309 Mont. 358, \u00b6 21, 47 P.3d 432, \u00b6 21. See also Eadus v.

Notwithstanding, even if the statutorily prescribed procedure set out in Title 7, Ch. 32, part\\n\\n41, MCA, is deemed to be an internal grievance procedure for purposes of \u00a7 39-2-911(2) and (3),\\n\\nMCA--and we do not decide that question here--McGinnis did not make that argument in the trial\\n\\ncourt nor does he make that argument on appeal. Indeed, he fails to cite either Casiano or Eadus for\\n\\nany purpose.\\n\\n                                                 15\\n\\x0c\u00b637    In short, McGinnis has failed to advance any legal argument demonstrating why the trial\\n\\ncourt should be reversed. Again, it is not this Court\\'s obligation to conduct legal research on an\\n\\nappellant\\'s behalf, to guess as to his precise position, or to develop legal analysis that may lend\\n\\nsupport to his position. In re Marriage of Snow, 2002 MT 143, \u00b6 28, 310 Mont. 260, \u00b6 28, 49 P.3d\\n\\n610, \u00b6 28 (citations omitted). We reiterate that failure to comply with Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., is\\n\\nfatal to an appeal. Blackcrow, \u00b6 33.\\n\\n\u00b638     In summary, \u00a7 7-32-4164, MCA, provides that a member of a police force may appeal to a\\n\\nlocal police commission for redress. Because \u00a7 7-32-4156, MCA, unambiguously mandates that an\\n\\nappeal to a police commission must be brought in writing, in the absence of McGinnis advancing\\n\\nany persuasive argument or authority to the contrary, it is our obligation to apply the statute as\\n\\nwritten. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that McGinnis was not denied a\\n\\nright to an appeal but rather, by failing to submit a written appeal to the police commission, he\\n\\nneglected to exercise that right.\\n\\n                                         CONCLUSION\\n\\n\u00b639    We hold that the District Court correctly dismissed McGinnis\u2019s claims and we affirm the\\n\\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of the City and the former Mayor of East Helena.\\n\\n\u00b640    Affirmed.\\n\\n                                                              \/S\/ JAMES C.

The action was commenced under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq., the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 206(d), commonly known as the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  Mrs. Strecker began working for the Board in 1969 and since 1970 has held various positions relating to the administration of economic welfare to recipients in North Dakota.  In 1977 she resigned her position to move to Bismarck, North Dakota with her husband where she assumed an administrative position with the state social services agency.  Her basic claim relates to the fact that her successor, a male, David Braaten, was paid substantially more money than she received when employed by the Board.  The district court, The Honorable Paul Benson, found that Mrs. Strecker had performed substantially equal work under similar working conditions but received less pay than her male successor.  Nonetheless, the district court denied relief holding the Board had proven the disparity in pay was based on factors other than sex.  She has appealed that ruling.  We affirm the judgment of the district court.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      Standard of Review.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Mrs. Strecker fails to demonstrate that any of the factual findings of the district court are clearly erroneous.  She challenges the ultimate finding by the district court that she was not unlawfully discriminated against.  Although there may be some confusion from our prior opinions, the ultimate conclusion of discrimination vel non is not governed by the clearly erroneous rule.  See Shultz v. American Can Co. Dixie Products, 424 F.2d 356, 360 n.6 (8th Cir. 1970).  As the Fifth Circuit has observed:\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Although discrimination vel non is essentially a question of fact it is, at the same time, the ultimate issue for resolution in this case, being expressly proscribed by 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 2000e-2(a).  As such, a finding of discrimination or nondiscrimination is a finding of ultimate fact.... In reviewing the district court\\'s findings, therefore, we will proceed to make an independent determination of appellant\\'s allegations of discrimination, though bound by findings of subsidiary fact which are themselves not clearly erroneous.  Also, ... we must determine whether there are requisite subsidiary facts to undergird the ultimate facts.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Causey v. Ford Motor Co., 516 F.2d 416, 421 (5th Cir. 1975) (citations omitted), quoted in Wade v. Mississippi Cooperative Extension Service, 528 F.2d 508, 516 (5th Cir. 1976).\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Applying this standard of review, we proceed to the merits of Mrs. Strecker\\'s claim.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      Equal Pay Act Violation.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Title VII and the Equal Pay Act must be construed in harmony.  DiSalvo v. Chamber of Commerce of Greater Kansas City, 568 F.2d 593, 596 (8th Cir. 1978).  Although plaintiff has brought suit under the Equal Pay Act as well as title VII, our basic analysis is essentially the same under either theory.1 To show a prima facie case, Mrs. Strecker must prove she performed substantially equal work as her successor but was paid less for it.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      1. Prima Facie Case.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      Contrary to defendants\\' argument on appeal, we agree that plaintiff established a prima facie case.  Plaintiff demonstrated that her wage rate, even during the last two years with the Board when she had assumed greater administrative responsibilities, was substantially less than that paid to her male successor.  The record demonstrates she was performing work substantially equal to that performed by Braaten when he first assumed his duties.  Under the statute, equal work means \"jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 206(d).  In determining whether work is equal, the court must look to the nature of the duties actually required and performed, not the official job description or title.  Katz v. School District of Clayton, Missouri, 557 F.2d 153, 156 (8th Cir. 1977).\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Although defendants attempt to urge that Braaten was hired as assistant director, the district court recognized the equality of work is not determined by duties or responsibilities which were to be assumed in the future.  See Peltier v. City of Fargo, 533 F.2d 374, 377 (8th Cir. 1976).  The evidence showed Mr. Braaten performed work substantially identical to Mrs. Strecker for nearly the first year he was employed by the Board.  The district court correctly concluded that they performed equal work.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Once Mrs. Strecker has proven a prima facie case, defendants have the burden of proving that the disparity in pay was based on some factor other than sex.  We conclude that they have done so.  An analysis of the record unequivocally sustains this conclusion.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      2. Statutory Defense.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Throughout her tenure with the agency, Mrs. Strecker\\'s classification and thus her salary were determined by the Central Personnel Division, Social Service Board of North Dakota (Central Personnel).  The Grand Forks County Board could only recommend changes in classifications Central Personnel had the final authority to determine classifications.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      The structure of the classification system used by Central Personnel to evaluate positions and persons, and thus set salaries, is undisputed.  Salaries are set by a dual classification system which classifies both positions and persons.  Positions are classified by the responsibilities and duties they require.  The qualifications or other characteristics of the person filling a position are irrelevant to the position\\'s classification.  Persons are classified according to their experience in areas related to their job responsibilities and their education.  Compensation systems that determine salaries on the basis of job duties and responsibilities, educational attainments and experience, which are related to the responsibilities and duties that employees must perform in their jobs, are clearly permissible under the Equal Pay Act.  See Horner v. Mary Institute, 613 F.2d 706, 714 (8th Cir. 1980); EEOC v. Aetna Insurance Co., 616 F.2d 719, 726 &amp; n.10 (4th Cir. 1980); EEOC v. New York Times Broadcasting Service, Inc., 542 F.2d 356, 359-60 (6th Cir. 1976); Herman v. Roosevelt Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, 432 F. Supp. 843, 851 (E.D.Mo.1977), aff\\'d, 569 F.2d 1033 (8th Cir. 1978) (the trial court said \"It is clear that an employer may pay a higher starting salary to one who has education or experience relevant to the job to be performed.... This Court does not wish to dictate to defendant what college courses it should consider as \\'job related\\' and what monetary value it should give them.\"); Brennan v. Federal National Mortgage Association, 12 FEP Cases 490 (C.D.Calif.1975).  Salary differentials that result from applying these objective criteria do not violate that act.2\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Under Central Personnel\\'s system, each classification is assigned a salary range.  The job classification determines the minimum3 and maximum salary which any person filling that position may receive.  The personal classification determines the minimum and maximum salary which a person so classified may receive.  Typically, a person\\'s classification matches the position classification so that the minimum and maximum salaries coincide.  However, the system allows mismatching of personal and position classifications.  If a job filled by an incumbent person is reevaluated to a higher classification, the system allows that person to remain in the job.  This is called \"underfilling\" the position.  In an underfilling situation, the person\\'s salary is determined by his or her personal classification not the classification of the position.  As the person gains the requisite experience or education, the person\\'s classification and salary are raised to equal the classification of his or her job.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      On July 1, 1975, after some difficulty,4 Mrs. Strecker\\'s position was reclassified as an Administrative Officer I. Central Personnel also found that at that time Mrs. Strecker, personally, had the experience to be classified as an Administrative Officer I, thus, her personal classification matched her job\\'s classification.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Administrative Officer I classification required four years of college or four years of supervisory experience.  Administrative Officer II classification required four years of college or equivalent experience and two years of professional experience within a public or private organization; Administrative Officer III required four years of college or equivalent and four years of professional experience.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      On March 18, 1977, Strecker and Ohlsen submitted a request to reclassify Strecker\\'s position to an Administrative Officer III.  This request was the result of prior discussions between Ohlsen and Ronald Leingang, State Social Service Board\\'s Personnel Officer.5 As a result of this reclassification request, Central Personnel reevaluated Strecker\\'s position to Administrative Officer III effective May 1, 1977.6 From May 1 to July 31, Strecker was underfilling her position.  According to the undisputed evidence she was classified only as an Administrative Officer I before July 1, 1977, because she did not have the requisite experience even though her job was classified as an Administrative Officer III.  Under the system, her salary remained that of an Administrative Officer I. Effective April 1, 1977, the Board increased her salary to the maximum within the Administrative Officer I range.  The Board voted Strecker this retroactive increase on April 14, 1977, after it had received informal notice that her position was to be upgraded to Administrative Officer III, and prior to extending its offer to Braaten.  At that time Central Personnel claimed Strecker was not qualified even for Administrative Officer II.  On April 18th the Board urged Central Personnel to reconsider Mrs. Strecker\\'s appeal.7\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      Mrs. Strecker offered no evidence that in her case the objective, neutral criteria of the Central Personnel classification system were not applied.  Rather she argues that she was effectively prevented by Mr. Ohlsen from being evaluated under the non-biased classification system.  She argues that Ohlsen prevented her from submitting her job description to Central Personnel for reevaluation and he did so because he was biased against women.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      Although some evidence exists that occasionally Ohlsen demonstrated a sex-based bias, no evidence shows that this bias precluded Strecker from having her job reclassified or that he was responsible for her staying at a lower salary.  Ohlsen testified that although he had not initiated any written job reclassification requests for Strecker since 1975, he had, in 1975 and 1976, made oral inquiries and received oral assurances that plaintiff\\'s position did not warrant a higher classification.  Defendants also introduced evidence that Ohlsen had supported reclassification requests in 1973 and 1975.  The latter occurred when he supported plaintiff\\'s appeal of the classification of her job as Eligibility Technician III.  The appeal was successful in raising the classification to Administrative Officer I.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      Even if we assume that Ohlsen prevented Mrs. Strecker from seeking reclassification of her job and did so because she is a woman, and further assuming that her position would have been reclassified as Administrative Officer III before May 1, 1977, the evidence is uncontradicted that she would not have received a higher salary because she did not have the personal qualifications to receive a salary at a level higher than Administrative Officer I prior to July 1, 1977.  Under the system she could have underfilled this position but her salary would have been determined by her personal classification, Administrative Officer I. In this appeal, plaintiff does not dispute the fact that she did not meet the education or experience requirements of an Administrative Officer III at any time during her employ with the agency or the requirements of an Administrative Officer II prior to July 1, 1977.  Because plaintiff could not personally be classified above Administrative Officer I, any reclassification of her position would not have affected her salary.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      The district court found that before 1977 plaintiff received the same percentage increase in salary as did all other employees of the agency and in 1977 her salary dramatically increased to the maximum allowed by her classification.  Additionally, the court found that prior to the time she announced her intention to leave, the position of plaintiff\\'s salary within her classification was commensurate with the salary of the other two supervisors within their classifications.  The court, in effect, held that the position of her salary within her classification was based upon factors other than her sex.  The court was also persuaded by the fact that when the Board found out Mrs. Strecker was going to resign, they increased her salary to the maximum in her grade and attempted to have her classification upgraded so that she would be in a better bargaining position when she sought a new job in Bismarck.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      The evidence further shows that every offer Ohlsen gave to prospects to replace Strecker was in the range allowed by the highest personal classification the prospect could attain with his or her education and experience.  This is true for both male as well as female prospects.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      We find the actions of Ohlsen and the Board were consistent in treating the agency\\'s supervisors equally within the confines of Central Personnel\\'s classification system.  The evidence may well support the conclusion that the classification system underpaid capable people, as Mrs. Strecker was shown to be, however, there is no showing that the system was designed to, or in fact resulted in underpaying persons because of their sex.  In any event, the bottom line is that Ohlsen and the Board could not advance Strecker without Central Personnel either altering its classification requirements or reevaluating Strecker\\'s personal qualifications.  As the April 18th letter of the Board to the Central Personnel Division demonstrates, the Board supported Strecker in efforts to have her advanced.  On the record it is difficult to understand what more Ohlsen or the Board could do to help Strecker.  It is obvious that Central Personnel controlled her advancement, not Ohlsen or the Board.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      In view of our holding affirming the district court, it is not necessary to pass on the issues raised by defendants on the cross appeal, No. 80-1063.8 Judgment affirmed.9\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      HEANEY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      I agree that Betty Lou Strecker established a prima facie case of sex discrimination by proving that the work she performed was substantially equal to the work performed by her male successor and that she was paid $7,532 less per year.1 Once she did so, the burden shifted to the defendants to prove that the disparity in pay was based on some factor other than sex.  In my view, the defendants have not sustained that burden and the district court should be reversed.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      The majority concludes, in substance, that the defendants sustained their burden by proving that the pay differential was justified by the state\\'s personnel classification system.  It is apparent from the record, however, that the defendants did nothing more than establish the existence of that system.  If the defendants\\' conduct is to be shielded by the affirmative defense provided by the Equal Pay Act, it was necessary for them to prove more.  First, they had to establish that the classification system\\'s requirements were reasonably related to the jobs to be performed.  Second, they had to show that Strecker did not have the qualifications necessary to justify classifying her at a higher grade.  Third, because the defendants took the position that the classification system prevented them from raising Strecker\\'s salary, they had to prove that she was being paid the highest salary that her classification would permit.  They failed on all three counts.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      * One cannot argue with the principle that a governmental unit can, without violating the Equal Pay Act or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, adopt and implement a classification system that classifies all jobs in that unit on the basis of job content.  Nor can one argue with the principle that a governmental unit can specify the education and experience that an employee must have, so long as the requirements are reasonably related to the job to be filled and are not used as a pretext to avoid paying women equal pay for substantially equal work.  I think it is clear, however, that once a prima facie case of discrimination is established, the employer bears the burden of proving that the education and experience requirements for the classification in question are reasonably related to the job duties to be performed.2 Unless the employer has this burden, the prima facie case concept is so weakened as to be useless.  The defendants failed to carry that burden here.  They presented no witnesses, expert or otherwise, to testify that it was reasonable to equate a year of college to a year\\'s administrative supervisory experience or to require six years of administrative supervisory experience to be classified and paid as Administrative Officer II, or eight years of similar experience to be classified and paid as an Administrative Officer III.3 Nor can we draw an inference that the stated experience was reasonably required in the face of undisputed evidence that Strecker very competently served as supervisor of Economic Assistance for over five years, even though she had only forty-five months of administrative supervisory experience when she first assumed the position.4\\n    \\n    II\\n    \\n      31\\n      Even if we assume that the classification system is a valid one, the defendants did not meet their burden of proving that Strecker lacked the personal qualifications necessary to be classified as and paid the salary of an Administrative Officer I as of May 1, 1972, and of an Administrative Officer II as of May 1, 1974.5 On the latter date, she had six years of administrative supervisory experience: twenty-eight months as a supervisor at the First Federal Savings and Loan Association,6 seventeen months as director of the Food Stamp Program for the County,7 and twenty-five months as supervisor of Economic Assistance for the County.8 Moreover, she had the eight years of required experience to be paid as an Administrative Officer III on July 1, 1976, as she then had two additional years of experience as supervisor of Economic Assistance.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      There is some testimony that the administrative supervisory experience that she acquired at First Federal and as director of the Food Stamp Program was not of the quality necessary to be considered the equivalent of an equal number of years of college.  But the testimony was vague and inconclusive and failed to establish just what experience does qualify as \"administrative supervisory\" or \"professional\" work experience.9 Without evidence of clearly articulated standards, or of a pattern of evaluating personnel in a consistent nondiscriminatory manner, I simply cannot agree that the defendants have established that the state\\'s classification system was a factor other than sex that justified the pay differential.10\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      Implicit in the majority opinion is the premise that a presumption of regularity should extend to the statewide classification system.  I cannot accept this premise; to accept it would be to deny Strecker the benefit of the prima facie case that even the majority concedes she has established here.  Nor can we infer that the state classification system is operated on a nondiscriminatory basis.  The record indicates that the State Personnel Office reclassified positions or individuals on the basis of requests from the County; the only exception being those occasions when the State Personnel Department reclassified all positions within a governmental unit.11 The County made no written requests to reclassify Strecker from April, 1972, until she gave notice of her intent to resign in early 1977.12 Clarence Ohlsen, the director of the County Social Service Board and its appointing authority, consistently and intentionally discriminated against women on the basis of sex, and he was, for all intents and purposes, the ultimate authority in personnel matters at the County level.13\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      Ohlsen\\'s discriminatory conduct is well illustrated by his dealings with Strecker.  When she became the supervisor of the County\\'s Economic Assistance Programs on April 1, 1972, Strecker indicated to Ohlsen that the $45 per month increase she was to receive with this promotion was inadequate compensation for her new responsibilities.  Ohlsen responded that she should not receive more because she did not have a college degree and because her husband made a good living so she should not worry about additional income.  This scenario was repeated in November of 1975 when Strecker again assumed significant additional responsibilities establishing and supervising the Child Support Enforcement Program (IV-D).  She received no raise in pay and Ohlsen told her not to file a new job description with the State accurately reflecting her increased responsibility.  Ohlsen indicated that the County\\'s budget was in poor shape and again reminded her that her husband made a good living.  He assured her that her salary would be reviewed in July, 1976.  At that time, however, she received only the standard seven and one-half percent salary increase given to all the agency\\'s employees.  In November of 1976, Strecker again approached Ohlsen regarding her salary and classification.  She had been encouraged by a State personnel officer to rewrite her job description to include her IV-D duties.  Ohlsen told her that she was not to fill out a new job description, again emphasizing that she should not always be worrying about more money because her husband had sufficient income.  Finally, all the male applicants for Strecker\\'s job were told that if they stayed with the agency for four or five years, and if their services were satisfactory, they could expect to be named Ohlsen\\'s successor as director of the agency.  Throughout her tenure as supervisor of Economic Assistance, Strecker was never given such assurances, nor were the female applicants for her position told this, despite the fact that some of them had college degrees.\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      Ohlsen\\'s discriminatory attitudes were reflected in his conduct toward other women at the agency as well.  Susan Senger, an account technician with the County, testified that Ohlsen had told her that she should not worry about her salary because her husband had a good job.  When Senger suggested during salary negotiations that the County should pay her health insurance benefits, Ohlsen\\'s response was that he had mostly female employees under him and that their husbands carried their health insurance.  Senger also testified that Ohlsen\\'s discriminatory attitude was apparent from the beginning: his first concern in her employment interview was whether she was married and whether she was planning on having children.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      The testimony of other female agency employees reinforced the impression that Ohlsen had sexist attitudes and that these attitudes influenced his personnel practices.  Pam Fordyce testified that she was present when Ohlsen told one of the female supervisors that he would not want to pay her any more money than her husband made.  Susan Grega, formerly a Food Stamp supervisor for the County, testified that Ohlsen had said that she was up for a raise but that he \"was having problems justifying that kind of money to the Board because she is a woman.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      The strong evidence of Ohlsen\\'s discriminatory attitudes and the testimony that Ohlsen\\'s support is essential to the success of employee reclassification requests, makes it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain that the statewide classification system ensured nondiscriminatory personnel decisions at the County level.\\n    \\n    III\\n    \\n      38\\n      Even if the defendants had carried their burden of proving that the classification system was a valid one and that Strecker did not have sufficient supervisory experience to justify being placed in a higher classification, they failed to prove that Strecker could not have been paid a higher salary under the classification system.  In fact, all evidence in the record is to the contrary.  Prior to July 1, 1975, Strecker was consistently paid below the mid-range of the salary for her classification.  On that date, she was classified as an Administrative Officer I and was paid $850 per month when the maximum rate for that classification was $1,029 per month.  From July 1, 1976, to April 1, 1977, she was paid $914 per month when the maximum rate was $1,080.  It was not until after she gave notice of her intent to resign that she was paid the maximum for her classification.  In the face of these facts, the majority should not have accepted the defendants\\' argument that they could pay Strecker no more than they did because of the classification system.\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      The district court found an alternate justification for the defendants\\' practice of paying Strecker less than they could.  The court stated:\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      The agency employees were predominately female.  The top three employees under Director Ohlsen (Clara Lyche, Betty Hanson, and plaintiff) were all female.  Except for the brief period when Strecker stayed on and trained (her successor) to take her job, there were no male employees within the establishment performing work which required equal skill, effort and responsibility to that being performed by plaintiff.  It is clear she was given equal treatment with other employees.\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      The record shows that the Board did not discriminate against plaintiff in rate of pay within the salary ranges for her classification.  Until 1977, she received the same percentage increase in salary as all other employees of the Agency.  In 1977, her salary increased dramatically, to the maximum allowable for her classification.\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      The essence of the district court\\'s decision is that, because Strecker was treated on the same basis as other women employed in the agency, she was not discriminated against.  This argument is without merit.  If it proves anything, it proves that women other than the plaintiff, particularly Lyche and Hanson, were also discriminated against.  The undisputed evidence is that Ohlsen, the only male supervisor, was paid at the maximum rate permitted for his classification.  The salaries of the two female supervisors, Lyche and Hanson, were very substantially raised to approximate the salary being paid Strecker\\'s successor only after they complained that they were being discriminated against because of their sex.\\n    \\n    \\n      43\\n      There is one matter that requires further comment.  The majority opinion suggests that Strecker cannot recover because the County did not have final authority to reclassify her and pay her the salary of the higher classification.  It also suggests that Strecker should have joined the State as a party defendant in the action.  I cannot agree with either suggestion.  The facts are, as we have pointed out, that Ohlsen made no significant effort to have Strecker reclassified until after she announced her resignation and that he had little, if any, trouble getting the position reclassified once he made the request.  In fact, Ronald Leingang testified that if Strecker was doing the same work in November of 1975, that she was when the request was submitted in 1977, \"then she should have been compensated at the Administrative Officer III level.\"  Moreover, he testified that Thomas Longmire of the State Personnel Office questioned the motivation for reclassifying the position when Strecker was about to leave it, and asked Ohlsen, \"Why didn\\'t you pay more for this job when the incumbent had it, when Betty had it.\"\\n    \\n    CONCLUSION\\n    \\n      44\\n      This case illustrates better than most the difficulty that women have in establishing a right to recover under the Equal Pay Act or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Strecker is obviously a highly competent, dedicated person who has by hard work raised herself to the upper levels of her profession, and she has done so without the benefit of a college education.  At every step of the way, she has worked hard for equal compensation, only to be turned down again and again because the defendants clung to the traditional view that women simply do not need to be paid as much as men, particularly if their husbands are working.14\\n    \\n    \\n      45\\n      Now, when she comes to court, she is met with one legal argument after another none of which, in my view, had any real merit.  One simply cannot escape the fact that Ohlsen and the County Board discriminated against Strecker on the basis of her sex.  Her successor was paid substantially more than she was paid, and it was within the power of the defendants not only to pay her more than they did throughout the years but also to have made sure that she was given credit for all her prior supervisory and administrative experience.\\n    \\n    \\n      46\\n      We have no alternative but to remand to the district court with directions to it to determine the back pay to which Strecker is entitled.  Unless the defendants prove that the classification system is a nondiscriminatory one and that Strecker was given full credit for her prior administrative and supervisory experience pursuant to that system, she is entitled to receive the difference between what she was paid and the sum paid to her successor for the period permitted by law.  The latter sum is to be reduced by across-the-board pay increases granted by the County during the relevant period.  If the defendants sustain their burden of proving that the system is nondiscriminatory and that Strecker was given proper credit for her prior experience, then her recovery should be limited to the difference between the salary she was paid during the statutorily allowed period and the maximum salary she could have been paid as an Administrative Officer I during that time.\\n    \\n    \\n      47\\n      Strecker is also entitled to an award of attorney\\'s fees for services rendered in the district court and this Court.  The district court is to determine the fees in that court on the basis of Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974).  Firefighters Institute for Racial Equality v. City of St. Louis, 549 F.2d 506 (8th Cir. 1977).  We should require an affidavit to be submitted as to the appropriate fee in this Court pursuant to the same standard.\\n    \\n    \\n      48\\n      Before LAY, Chief Judge, HEANEY, ROSS, STEPHENSON, HENLEY, McMILLIAN and ARNOLD, Circuit Judges, sitting En Banc.*\\n    \\n    \\n      49\\n      PER CURIAM.\\n    \\n    \\n      50\\n      The majority opinion of the panel is adopted by the court en banc.\\n    \\n    \\n      51\\n      McMILLIAN, Circuit Judge, joins HEANEY, Circuit Judge, in his dissent.\\n    \\n    \\n      52\\n      IT IS SO ORDERED.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        *\\n         Donald J. Porter, United States District Judge, District of South Dakota, sitting by designation\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         There appears to be some difference in both substantive and procedural approach.  Substantively, title VII requires a showing of discriminatory intent.  The Equal Pay Act creates a type of strict liability; no intent to discriminate need be shown.  Procedurally, once a plaintiff has shown a prima facie case of sex discrimination under title VII the burden of going forward with the evidence to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason shifts to the employer.  Plaintiff still retains the ultimate burden of proof to show discriminatory intent and that the justification by the defendant was pretextual.  See Furnco Const. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577-78, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 2949-50, 57 L. Ed. 2d 957 (1978); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)\\n        Under the Equal Pay Act, once a prima facie case has been established, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 206(d) provides defendants four affirmative defenses.  Defendants have the burden of proving the wage disparity is the result of:\\n        (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex.\\n        See Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 196-97, 94 S. Ct. 2223, 2229, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1974); Shultz v. American Can Co. Dixie Products, 424 F.2d 356, 362 n.10 (8th Cir. 1970).  Title VII incorporates the Equal Pay Act defenses, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(h), therefore, defendants who prove one of these defenses cannot be held liable under either the Equal Pay Act or title VII.  See Gunther v. County of Washington, 602 F.2d 882, 891 (9th Cir. 1979); Molthan v. Temple Univ., 442 F. Supp. 448, 454 (E.D.Pa.1977).\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         Arguably, the educational and experience requirements could be a pretext for sex discrimination, however, plaintiff introduced no evidence that this was Central Personnel\\'s intent when it established these criteria\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         If the position is \"underfilled\" the minimum does not apply\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         In 1975 reclassification came about because Central Personnel was at that time converting to the current system of classifications.  Originally, Strecker\\'s position was classified as Eligibility Technician III.  After appeal by Strecker with Ohlsen\\'s support, the position was reclassified to Administrative Officer I. Although Strecker\\'s testimony suggests she could not apply to Central Personnel for reclassification on her own, the evidence suggests to the contrary.  Strecker\\'s petition for her 1975 reclassification was made on her own; Leingang, the State Personnel Director, indicated that an employee could petition on his or her own but that he would then notify the Board\\'s director\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         The evidence is not clear whether the decision to make this request occurred before or after plaintiff gave Ohlsen notice of her resignation\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         Mr. Longmire of Central Personnel indicated in an exhibit that the reclassification request supported reclassification to Administrative Officer III but only weakly.  He also wrote that subsequent information he received indicating that the position would also serve as assistant director made the classification stronger\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         A letter, written by Frank Bowles, chairman of the Grand Forks County Social Service Board, to Richard Espeland, Director of the Central Personnel Division, strongly indicates that the Board fully supported Mrs. Strecker\\'s qualifications for the salary of an Administrative Officer III.  After extolling Mrs. Strecker\\'s personal virtues and her professional competency the letter reads in part:\\n        Now, it is my understanding that to be an Administrative Officer III, you must have a certain number of years of experience and a college degree, and that if you do not have the college degree, you substitute a year for a year\\'s experience.  It is our contention here that this young lady in this agency has at least seven years experience as an administrator, and it is our contention further that the experience she had at First Federal Savings &amp; Loan should be qualified.  It is beyond the scope of our comprehension how a person who is so widely acclaimed in the State of North Dakota as an efficient, good administrator cannot qualify, for some vague reason, for the position.\\n        To go further with this, we understand that when Central Calssification (sic) came in in (sic) 1974, she was \"grandfathered\" in, and that for some reason Central Classification feels that it\\'s not possible to add to the credentials by further experience after that time.  Let me hasten to say to you, Mr. Espeland, that every month she stayed on the job we have seen her grow, and she has added to the job in maturity and in experience, and really, no matter what your regulations might say, the fact is she has become a better supervisor as time goes on.  We believe in systems, too, and through systems we have some sort of order, but I think that you would agree with me that in any system that is set up, there are situations that develop that do not fit into the system.\\n        We sincerely believe that Mrs. Strecker is an individual who, through her long years of association with this agency, deserves a compassionate hearing from your department, and that she be given her due.  We really believe that she qualifies for Administrative Officer III, but if this exerts too much pressure on your department, we would settle for Administrative Officer II.\\n        In closing, Mr. Espeland, we are talking about an individual who has proven herself and is a valued employee in the State of North Dakota.  We don\\'t want this person to lose faith in the system, and we certainly could not afford her leaving the system because of discouragement with it.  We have heard many fine things about your operation and know that you have problems in setting up a new department.  We must not, however, allow the size of an operation to outweigh the situation of any one individual in the system.  We, however, thank you for the time you spent in reviewing this and trust that you will give it your complete attention.\\n        Thereafter on July 1, 1977, Central Personnel reclassified her to Administrative Officer II.  It appears Central Personnel used July 1, 1975, the date she advanced to Administrative Officer I, as the date she completed her four years of supervisory experience as the equivalency for four years of college.  On July 1, 1977, she had two additional years of professional experience and was reclassified as an Administrative Officer II.  Her salary increased correspondingly to the top of that grade.  She remained in that classification until she resigned effective July 31, 1977.\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         Defendant also appeals from the clerk of court\\'s disallowance of costs for failure to file a bill of costs within ten days after notice of entry of judgment pursuant to local rule XXIII-A-4.  Defendant moves this court to require the district court to consider its motion for retaxation of costs.  Notice of entry of judgment was given on December 27, 1979.  The bill of costs was not filed until January 10, 1980.  We find no abuse of discretion in denying the defendants\\' bill of costs\\n      \\n      \\n        9\\n         The dissent raises many arguments not briefed or urged by appellant in her brief.  It is fundamental that it would be improper to decide this case on grounds not raised in the district court.  The main thrust of the dissent is (1) that appellant possessed administrative experience entitling her to a higher classification and (2) that the State Board\\'s classification system was not job related.  Appellant raised neither argument in her brief or in the trial below.  Plaintiff did not assert at trial or on this appeal that she possessed the education or experience requirements of an Administrative Officer II at any time during her employment prior to July 1, 1977.  Additionally, she does not claim that the state-wide classification system was not reasonably related to her job or that the classification creates a discriminatory impact on females over males.  In any event, both of these classification evaluations fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and it is difficult to assess how these defendants can be held responsible for something over which they had no control\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         Immediately before Mrs. Strecker announced her resignation, her salary was $10,968 annually.  Her replacement, David Braaten, was offered and received $18,500 for doing substantially equal work\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         In Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1971), the Supreme Court held that when a plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that an employer\\'s hiring and promotional criteria are discriminatory in effect, the burden shifts to the employer to prove that the requirements bear a \"manifest relationship\" to the employment in question.  Accord, Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 45 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1974).  The Supreme Court has further described the legal standard to be applied:\\n        (D)iscriminatory tests are impermissible unless shown, by professionally acceptable methods, to be \"predictive of or significantly correlated with important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated.\" 29 CFR &#167; 1607.4(c).\\n        The employment practice successfully challenged in Griggs was the defendant\\'s requirement that employees have a high school degree and achieve satisfactory scores on two general intelligence tests.  Accord, James v. Stockham Valves &amp; Fittings, 669 F.2d 310 (5th Cir. 1977); Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d 211 (5th Cir. 1974).  The principle that employment criteria must be \"job related\" has been reiterated in the context of experience and degree requirements such as those at issue here.  Parson v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp., 575 F.2d 1374 (5th Cir. 1978); Leisner v. N. Y. Telephone Co., 5 FEP Cases 733 (S.D.N.Y.1973).  The Griggs test has also been applied to such employment practices as written promotional exams, Firefighters Institute, Etc. v. City of St. Louis, 549 F.2d 506 (8th Cir. 1977), and height and weight requirements, Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 97 S. Ct. 2720, 53 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1977); Craig v. County of Los Angeles, 626 F.2d 659 (9th Cir. 1980); U. S. v. Lee Way Motor Freight, Inc., 625 F.2d 918 (10th Cir. 1979).\\n        In this case, as we have pointed out, the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination.  She has shown that she and two other female employees of the Grand Forks County Social Service Board, who held positions substantially similar to hers, were paid less than her replacement.  The state could have rebutted this prima facie case by introducing evidence that the wage disparities were justified by experience or education requirements that were in fact demonstrably related to the jobs in question.  It is true that Strecker established her prima facie case by showing that she individually was discriminated against, rather than by showing that the state\\'s classification system was discriminatory in effect.  However, the principles established by Griggs must still be applicable, or the burden placed on the Equal Pay Act defendants to prove that wage differentials are not sex-based will be meaningless.\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         The defendants must establish that the experience and education requirements necessary for an individual to be personally classified as an Administrative Officer II or III are reasonably related to the jobs to be performed in a job classified as Administrative Officer II or III because of the close correlation between the \"personal\" and \"position\" classifications.  A job may be \"underfilled\" for a time by someone whose personal classification is one level lower than that of the job.  Generally, however, a person\\'s classification matches that of her or his job\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         Strecker was appointed as Supervisor of Economic Assistance on April 1, 1972.  There is no evidence in the record as to the classification system in effect at that time other than the testimony that persons were classified on the basis of the work they were required to do\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         Strecker was classified as an Administrative Officer I on July 1, 1975.  On that date, she had been supervisor of Economic Assistance for thirty-nine months; thus, she was given nine months credit for other supervisory services.  The record is silent as to whether the credit was given for work at the First Federal Savings and Loan Association or for work as the director of the Food Stamp Program.  See notes 6 and 7. No explanation is given as to why only a partial credit was allowed for either of the past experiences.  Ohlsen testified that he never knew whether Strecker\\'s experience with the First Federal Savings and Loan Association and with the agency as director of the Food Stamp Program had been counted or not.  Strecker was classified as an Administrative Officer II on July 1, 1977, one month before her resignation became effective.  Her salary was $1,380 per month, or $16,560 a year $2,000 less than her successor was paid\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         Strecker was Chief Teller at First Federal, supervising four to five full-time and additional part-time tellers.  She was totally responsible for the bank\\'s savings bonds and traveler\\'s checks as well as other savings and loan teller duties.  Prior to her experience as a Chief Teller, she had worked at three other financial institutions as a teller and had had some administrative experience at at least one of them\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         Strecker was responsible for establishing and supervising the Food Stamp Program when it was first initiated by the County.  Her duties included setting up the files, learning the eligibility requirements established by the federal government and generally handling all problems generated by the new program.  She supervised one to two Food Stamp workers\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         As supervisor of Economic Assistance, Strecker was in charge of all the County\\'s Economic Assistance Programs: AFDC, Aid to the Disabled, Old Age Assistance, Medicare and General Assistance.  She supervised an increasing number of employees and controlled the expenditure of over $2 million in funds.  In November, 1975, she assumed the additional responsibility of establishing and supervising a new project initiated by the County: the Child Support Enforcement Program.  Three additional personnel were put under her supervision at that time\\n      \\n      \\n        9\\n         Ronald Leingang, personnel officer of the Social Services Board of North Dakota, testified: \"It is awfully difficult to know what constitutes an equivalency.  It is a question that we ask all the time.  The only way we finally know is to have an applicant apply for a job with a certain set of circumstances and run that applicant through the system and finally determine what the decision is on the part of the Central Personnel Division.\"  Leingang\\'s testimony serves to emphasize the fact that the classification system was highly subjective in its application\\n      \\n      \\n        10\\n         See, Hodgson v. Brookhaven General Hospital, 436 F.2d 719 (5th Cir. 1970)\\n      \\n      \\n        11\\n         In 1973, the State requested job descriptions from all personnel performing eligibility functions in the County agencies.  As a result, Strecker was reclassified from a Secretary I to an Eligibility Technician III as of April 1, 1973.  In 1975, the State adopted a new classification system and initiated a statewide reclassification of all its employees.  Strecker was again requested to fill out a job description, and she and her position were upgraded to Administrative Officer I\\n      \\n      \\n        12\\n         Ohlsen testified that he talked with Ronald Leingang \"by phone several times\" about reclassifying Strecker.  He did not, however, submit any written requests to reconsider her classification\\n      \\n      \\n        13\\n         Several women employees of the Board were subpoenaed to testify by Strecker.  They testified, in substance, that Ohlsen was a dominating personality, that he ran the agency, that he determined the agenda and that what he said went as far as the Board was concerned.  They also testified that Ohlsen was angry at Strecker for filing the lawsuit and took his anger out on some of the female employees\\n      \\n      \\n        14\\n         Fifteen years after the enactment of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII, women were still earning only fifty-eight percent of what men were earning.

Craig Coombs\\'s motion for summary judgment. In the district court, State challenged a decision of the Foreign Service Grievance Board (\"FSGB\" or \"Board\") granting relief to Coombs. The district court, reviewing the Board\\'s decision under the Administrative Procedure Act, denied State\\'s appeal. We reverse.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      * Coombs joined State in 1990 and, in 1998, was assigned to be an administrative and consular officer at the United States Consulate General in Surabaya, Indonesia. Coombs\\'s year 2000 employee evaluation report (\"EER\") was critical of his performance in Surabaya and did not recommend him for promotion. Based on the 2000 EER, Coombs was \"low-ranked\" by the Selection Board, which competitively evaluates Foreign Service officers across each class. As a result, Coombs was referred to the Performance Standards Board (\"PSB\") for consideration for selection out of the Foreign Service. The PSB recommended that Coombs be selected out of the Foreign Service, and State notified Coombs of his impending separation in February 2001. Soon thereafter, State\\'s regional medical officer, Dr. Riesland, learned from Coombs\\'s colleagues at the Surabaya consulate that Coombs was exhibiting troubling behavioral problems. Under the (apparently false) impression that Coombs was still waiting to undergo a performance review, Dr. Riesland arranged for Coombs to meet with State\\'s regional psychiatrist, Dr. Lauer, for a clinical interview. After a two and a half hour examination, Dr. Lauer determined that Coombs had \"no discernible pathology other than probable characterological issues.\" Dr. Lauer observed that \"no psychiatric medication seems indicated at present.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Coombs submitted an amended agency-level grievance in May 2001 contesting his separation. His grievance contained an affidavit from Dr. Bristol, a board-certified psychiatrist unaffiliated with State, who, having reviewed prior EERs for Coombs, diagnosed him with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder and Acute Adjustment Disorder during the time period covered by the 2000 EER. According to Dr. Bristol\\'s affidavit, Coombs\\'s personality disorders became \"exaggerated and dysfunctional\" due to the stress of his difficult work environment in Surabaya. Coombs, relying on this affidavit, argued that the 2000 EER was \"falsely prejudicial\" under the terms of the Foreign Service Act (\"FSA\"), see 22 U.S.C. &#167; 4131(a)(1)(A), (E), because it was based on behavior attributable to Coombs\\'s undiagnosed mental illness. State denied Coombs\\'s agency-level grievance on September 21, 2001.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Coombs appealed the agency-level decision on his grievance to the FSGB. In the proceeding before the Board, State disputed Coombs\\'s claim of mental disability and pointed to the psychiatric examination performed by Dr. Lauer, wherein Lauer attributed Coombs\\'s behavior to \"character problems.\" On January 27, 2003, the Board issued its decision, FSGB Case No. 2001-34, stating, inter alia, that Coombs\\'s poor performance was in fact behavior attributable to psychiatric illness, that the EER based on his poor performance was falsely prejudicial, and that State\\'s ignorance of Coombs\\'s condition furnished even greater cause to set aside his 2000 EER. In arriving at its decision, the Board had determined that Dr. Bristol\\'s findings were more credible than those of Dr. Lauer because Bristol\\'s familiarity with Coombs\\'s condition was of longer duration than Lauer\\'s, and because Bristol\\'s explanation of Coombs\\'s behavior was far more detailed and persuasive. Along with other collateral relief, the Board ordered State to rescind Coombs\\'s proposed separation, to expunge his 2000 EER, and to provide him with an appropriate regular assignment unless he was \"medically disqualified.\" State then requested that the Board reconsider its decision, but the Board rejected State\\'s arguments for reconsideration.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Prior to the Board\\'s decision in Case No. 2001-34 (i.e., Coombs\\'s original grievance appeal), Coombs received another unsatisfactory rating in his 2001 EER. Coombs then filed a second agency-level grievance with respect to the 2001 report, alleging that it was falsely prejudicial for the same reasons the 2000 EER had been deemed so. State denied Coombs\\'s second agency-level grievance.1 Coombs appealed State\\'s decision to the FSGB, and the Board, relying on its determination in Case No. 2001-34, decided the 2001 EER was (also) falsely prejudicial. As relief, the Board ordered that the EER be expunged and that any adverse decision based on the EER be rescinded.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      State then sought review of the Board\\'s decisions with respect to the 2000 and 2001 EERs in federal district court. Coombs moved for judgment on the pleadings, and State cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court, treating Coombs\\'s motion as one for summary judgment, granted it. State\\'s motion was denied.\\n    \\n    II\\n    \\n      7\\n      State objects to the Board\\'s determination on two grounds. First, it is argued that Coombs, by asserting the EERs were \"falsely prejudicial\" under &#167; 4131(a)(1)(A) and (E), is really making a claim for disability discrimination pursuant to &#167; 4131(a)(1)(H)(iii), which allows Foreign Service officers to bring a grievance for any discrimination prohibited by the Rehabilitation Act.2 Under the Rehabilitation Act, a government employee has a valid claim only if he or she can show, inter alia, that the employer knew or had reason to know about the employee\\'s alleged impairment when it made an adverse employment decision. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 791(g); 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a); Crandall v. Paralyzed Veterans of Am., 146 F.3d 894, 896-97 (D.C.Cir. 1998). Although Coombs\\'s grievance explicitly listed the Rehabilitation Act (as incorporated in the FSA) as potentially providing jurisdiction over his claim, he does not allege that State knew or had reason to know about his alleged disability when it drafted his evaluation reports. Moreover, even if an employer is shown to have acted with knowledge of an employee\\'s disability, only \"qualified\" employees&#8212;those who can perform the essential functions of their job with (or without) \"reasonable accommodation\" &#8212;are protected from discrimination. See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12111(8), (9), 12112(a). State argues that the Board, by directing the agency to reinstate Coombs unless \"medically disqualified,\" has imposed a broader obligation on State than that which the Rehabilitation Act requires, and an obligation that is counter to another policy of Congress&#8212;that the nation have \"a career foreign service, characterized by excellence and professionalism,\" assuring the \"separation of those who do not meet the requisite standards of performance.\" 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3901(a)(1), (b)(1).\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      It is State\\'s view that the Board has stretched its authority under the Foreign Service Act to condemn EERs that are \"falsely prejudicial,\" and in doing so has run afoul of congressional policy set forth in the Rehabilitation Act. And if there was any doubt as to congressional intent&#8212; which State does not concede&#8212;it would be dispelled by the specific inclusion of the Rehabilitation Act as one of the various grievances a Foreign Service officer may bring under the Foreign Service Act. See 22 U.S.C. &#167; 4131(a)(1)(H)(iii). Indeed, State emphasizes that Coombs explicitly relied on the Rehabilitation Act in his initial agency-level grievance, and again in his appeal to the Board. The Board\\'s treatment of his falsely prejudicial claim as qualitatively different from a Rehabilitation Act claim simply rewards \"artful pleading,\" according to State.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      As an alternative position, State argues that the Board\\'s interpretation of the FSA is contrary to law. According to this argument, the two EERs were not falsely prejudicial because they were not in any sense \"false.\" The government concedes that the Board has the primary authority to interpret the grievance provision of the Foreign Service Act.3 Were the phrase ambiguous, then, the Board would be entitled to Chevron deference, and we would uphold any reasonable interpretation of the statute. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). But State argues that the phrase \"falsely prejudicial\" is in no way susceptible to the Board\\'s interpretation.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      We take up State\\'s second argument first. State argues that the term \"false\" necessarily refers to an intentional misstatement. We disagree. The word is ambiguous it could mean intentionally false&#8212;that may well be its more typical usage&#8212;but it is not an inevitable meaning. \"False\" can also mean simply \"not true.\" The Board\\'s adoption of the second meaning is certainly authorized under Chevron, 467 U.S. at843-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778. However, that is not enough to bring the Board home because, whether intentional or not, \"false\" does, at a minimum, mean untrue, and nothing in either EER is contrary to fact in that sense. Coombs essentially argues that the EERs are incomplete because they do not include a valid psychiatric explanation for his behavior. But to be incomplete is not the same as being \"false\"&#8212;particularly when the person completing the EER is entirely unaware of the omitted information. Thus, the Board\\'s interpretation of \"falsely prejudicial\" strikes us as an impermissible interpretation of ambiguous language (Chevron Step II).\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      We are puzzled, however, because the Foreign Service Act also authorizes the Board to correct a grievant\\'s personnel record if it finds the record is prejudicial because of an \"omission.\" See 22 U.S.C. &#167; 4131(a)(1)(E). That would seem to be a possible statutory basis for the Board to rely on in granting relief to Coombs. We, of course, do not so conclude because it would be up to the Board to make that decision in the first instance.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      The more difficult issue is the interrelationship of the Rehabilitation Act and the Foreign Service Act. State, it will be recalled, argues that Congress\\'s specific attention to the personnel problems of disabled employees \"occupies the field,\" so to speak. On State\\'s reading of the two statutes, the Rehabilitation Act provides the exclusive form of relief for disabled Foreign Service officers. As a consequence, the Board may not circumvent the Rehabilitation Act by relying on the general grievance language of the FSA to provide relief to an officer if that officer cannot make out a cause of action under the Rehabilitation Act itself&#8212;either because he or she can not show discriminatory intent, or because he or she cannot be reasonably accommodated.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      State relies heavily on Brown v. General Services Administration, 425 U.S. 820, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976), in which the Supreme Court held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides the sole judicial remedy for federal employees complaining of job-related discrimination. In that case, the plaintiff brought an employment discrimination claim in federal district court after the thirty-day limitation period prescribed by Title VII had expired. Faced with this procedural bar, plaintiff sought to rely on other, less-onerous, anti-discrimination remedies. Id. at 823-25, 96 S.Ct. 1961. The Court refused to allow the plaintiff to elude Title VII\\'s thirty-day requirement by \"artful pleading.\" Id. at 833, 96 S.Ct. 1961.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Coombs contends his case is quite different because he is not asserting a discrimination claim. Indeed, he freely admits that State had no knowledge of his disability when it created his EER. There is no reason, according to Coombs, to read a statute banning discrimination as implicitly prohibiting the Board from remedying an incomplete personnel record that became the basis of adverse employment action.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      Assuming arguendo that Coombs is correct&#8212;a point we need not decide&#8212;it seems to us that the Board\\'s remedy is still problematic, as well as unexplained. In the Rehabilitation Act, for example, Congress provided that State may knowingly discharge a disabled employee who cannot be reasonably accommodated, and under the Act could thus a fortiori discharge a disabled employee who cannot be so accommodated when State has no knowledge of the employee\\'s disability. Yet the Board\\'s order directing Coombs\\'s reinstatement unless \"medically disqualified\" appears to place a substantially greater burden on State. The relief granted by the Board is, at best, ambiguous on this point: How the term \"medically disqualified\" relates to \"reasonable accommodation,\" the Board does not say. In particular, it does not say whether its order would require Coombs\\'s reinstatement even if he cannot perform the essential functions of the job (even with a reasonable accommodation for his disability).\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      The Board does not appear to have even considered whether it is reasonable to require reinstatement of such an employee, in light of the demands of the Foreign Service. We think such an omission makes the Board\\'s decision arbitrary and capricious. We therefore vacate and remand for the Board to reconsider its interpretation of 22 U.S.C. &#167; 4131(a)(1)(A) and (E) and whether its ordering Coombs\\'s reinstatement is appropriate in light of both the Rehabilitation Act and the demands of the Foreign Service. The other relief granted by the Board (i.e., expungement of the 2000 and 2001 EERs, insertion of gap memoranda, extension of time to compete for promotion, and attorney\\'s fees) is collateral to the Board\\'s decision to rescind Coombs\\'s separation, and the Board should reevaluate it accordingly.\\n    \\n    III\\n    \\n      17\\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgement of the district court is reversed and the decision of the Board vacated.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        Notes:\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         In denying Coombs\\'s second grievance, State noted that it had requested reconsideration of FSGB Case No. 2001-34, which request was still before the Board\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         The FSA provides, in relevant part:\\n        (a)(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, for purposes of this subchapter, the term \"grievance\" means any act, omission, or condition subject to the control of the Secretary which is alleged to deprive a member of the [Foreign] Service who is a citizen of the United States ... of a right or benefit authorized by law or regulation or which is otherwise a source of concern or dissatisfaction to the member, including&#8212;\\n        (A) separation of the member allegedly contrary to laws or regulations, or predicated upon alleged inaccuracy, omission, error, or falsely prejudicial character of information in any part of the official personnel record of the member;\\n        ...\\n        (E) alleged inaccuracy, omission, error, or falsely prejudicial character of information in the official personnel record of the member which is or could be prejudicial to the member;\\n        ...\\n        (H) any discrimination prohibited by&#8212;\\n        ...\\n        (iii) section 791 of Title 29 ....\\n        22 U.S.C. &#167; 4131.\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Given State\\'s concession, we need not decide whether, with respect to the FSA\\'s grievance provisions, we should defer to the interpretations of the Board (and not the Secretary of State)\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 186906}]"},{"id":588312,"date_filed":"1992-08-20","judges":null,"case_name_full":"Marie Assa'ad-Faltas, M.D., Mph v.

She also claimed retaliatory discharge in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3 (1981) (Title VII).  At the close of Faltas\\'s case in chief, the district court granted the Department\\'s motion to dismiss Faltas\\'s claim of national origin discrimination.  Following completion of trial, the court held that Faltas failed to establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination.  Faltas now appeals the district court\\'s disposition of her sex discrimination claim, as well as her claim of retaliatory discharge.1  She apparently does not challenge the district court\\'s dismissal of her claim of national origin discrimination.  Finding no reversible error in the decision of the district court, we affirm.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      * In January of 1989 the Department hired Faltas to fill the position of Director of the Northern Neck Health District.  As a physician licensed in the state of Virginia, and as a recipient of a Masters degree in Public Health, she was well qualified for the position.  H. MacDonald Rimple (Rimple), also a medical doctor, was primarily responsible for recruiting Faltas for the job of District Director.  Once Faltas was hired, Rimple acted as her direct supervisor.  Approximately three and a half months after Faltas\\'s starting date, following Rimple\\'s first formal evaluation of her job performance, she was discharged.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Aside from these background facts, the parties disagree as to practically every fact material to what transpired during Faltas\\'s brief tenure as Director of the Northern Neck Health District.  The Department contends that Faltas immediately created an unfavorable impression by adopting an extremely confrontational style of management.  According to evidence adduced at trial, many of her colleagues, her subordinates and her patients found her to be abrasive and arrogant.  Rimple testified that, after receiving complaints about Faltas\\'s behavior, he took her to lunch several times in order to counsel her about her lack of interpersonal skills.  Rimple maintained that during those lunch meetings he was generally complimentary of her work, but requested that she be less demanding and confrontational with colleagues and patients.  In spite of these counseling sessions, the Department claims, Faltas continued to alienate colleagues and patients, causing serious morale problems to develop in the Northern Neck District office.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Rimple testified that on April 14, 1989, having been apprised fully of Faltas\\'s shortcomings, and having himself observed her behavior, he met with her to discuss her poor performance and to inform her that her numerical evaluation score, which he had tabulated according to Department protocols, fell below acceptable standards.  According to his testimony, he told her that, due to a performance score of less than 20, he would have to recommend her discharge.  Rimple claims that upon receiving this news Faltas became defensive and angry, questioning the veracity of his evaluation of her performance, as well as the accuracy of his mathematical calculations in tabulating her numerical performance rating.  According to Rimple, it was after he gave her the news of her imminent discharge that she raised for the first time her accusations of sexual harassment.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Rimple, who had never before been accused of sexual harassment, claims to have been astounded by Faltas\\'s charge.  He testified that he never made any sexual advances toward Faltas.  Rimple and the Department admitted at trial that he often kisses and hugs employees, but explained that such physical signs of affection and approval are common in Trinidad, where Rimple was raised.  Other employees of the Department, both male and female, testified that Rimple was physically demonstrative with them, but that everyone considered his behavior normal and acceptable.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      On April 17 Rimple formally submitted his evaluation of Faltas\\'s work to his superiors.  On April 26, Rimple again met with Faltas to discuss the final version of her evaluation report.  Shortly thereafter, in accordance with Rimple\\'s evaluation, Faltas was notified of her discharge.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      Faltas offers a starkly different version of events.  According to her, Rimple consistently exhibited physical signs of affection for her, including but not limited to kissing her on the cheek when greeting her, holding her hand during their lunch meetings and putting his arm around her when introducing her to the District staff.  According to Faltas, Rimple accompanied those physical signs of affection with what at first amounted to veiled suggestions of romance, but later developed into frank declarations of love.  Faltas claims that the private lunches and meetings that Rimple arranged, far from being \"counseling sessions,\" were contrived as opportunities for Rimple to press his case as a suitor.  Faltas contends that only a few days before their April 14 meeting, Rimple offered to defend her from attacks by her subordinates on the condition that she respond to his romantic advances.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Faltas contends that on April 12, two days before her first evaluation meeting with Rimple, she sent a memorandum to Rimple and his supervisor complaining of sexual harassment.  In fact, the memorandum, which Rimple apparently received on April 13, focused on Faltas\\'s criticism of the procedure under which her performance was to be evaluated;  however, the memorandum also stated that:\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      [I] must assert that I will not accept any attempt to compromise the scope of my authorities based on my young age relative to that of other district health directors, my female sex, my Coptic race, or my Egyptian national origin;  nor will I accept a duty to satisfy every whim of my superiors and my subordinates....  VDH [has a duty] to provide a work environment free of harassments to all its employees.  To this effect are relevant portions of  Meritor Savings Bank, FSB. v. Vinson et.al., 106 S.Ct. 2399 (1986).\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      Joint Appendix at 227.  Rimple testified at trial that he understood this memorandum to be a general complaint about Faltas\\'s perception of unfair treatment.  He claims that he did not understand this communication to be a complaint about sexual harassment.  Faltas does not contend that Rimple\\'s asserted interpretation of her memorandum is false or unreasonable.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Faltas maintains that during her meeting with Rimple on April 14, he read to her the evaluation scores that he intended to assign to her work, and those scores added up to 24.5, a satisfactory level of performance.  She further contends that, at that meeting, in response to his questions of why she was avoiding him, she made plain her opposition to his sexual harassment.  Faltas claims that after their April 14 meeting ended, and after she had confronted Rimple with her accusation of sexual harassment, he lowered her evaluation score to 17.5, an unsatisfactory level of performance.  Not until her April 26 meeting with Rimple, Faltas claims, was she aware that her performance had been adjudged unsatisfactory.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Faltas filed her original complaint in this case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division, asserting a number of state and federal causes of action against several defendants, including the Department.  Because a related case previously had been initiated in the Richmond Division, Assa\\'ad-Faltas v. Virginia, No. 89-00275-R (E.D. Va.  July 26, 1989) (Title VII claims dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because EEOC had neither concluded its processing of Faltas\\'s charge nor issued a right-to-sue notice), the case was transferred to the Richmond Division on motion of the Department.  Pursuant to motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, the district court dismissed all causes of action other than Faltas\\'s Title VII claims of national origin and sex discrimination, and all parties except the Department.  Faltas then filed an amended complaint in the form of a More Definite Statement, alleging that she had been harassed and discharged because of her sex and national origin, and that she was fired in retaliation for her complaints about harassment, all in violation of Title VII.  Faltas sought declaratory and compensatory relief, including back pay, lost benefits, reinstatement and attorneys fees.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      At the conclusion of Faltas\\'s evidence, the court granted the Department\\'s motion to dismiss her claim of Title VII national origin discrimination.  After the completion of the trial the court entered judgment for the Department on the remaining claim of sex discrimination.  This appeal followed.\\n    \\n    II\\n    \\n      14\\n      Faltas presents three separate grounds for reversal.  She argues first that the district court was clearly erroneous in its assessment of the evidence.  Second, Faltas contends that the district court erred by finding that she failed to establish a prima facie  case of quid pro quo sexual harassment.  Finally, Faltas argues that the district court erred by failing to consider her claim of retaliatory discharge.  We address each of these contentions in turn.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      * Although Faltas presents her challenge to the evidence as a single, unitary argument, she in fact offers two separate attacks on the district court\\'s treatment of the evidence, each calling for its own standard of review.  Neither argument compels reversal.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Faltas first contends that the district court weighed the evidence incorrectly and lent credence to testimony that was inherently incredible.  She points to evidence on the record which favors her version of events, evidence that she claims the district court simply ignored.  She also highlights alleged inconsistencies in Rimple\\'s testimony about her job performance, and claims that these alleged inconsistencies render Rimple\\'s testimony so incredible that it was error for the court to rely upon it.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      We review factual findings of the district court for clear error.   See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 (1985).  We find no such error here.  Presented with hotly contested facts, supported by testimony on both sides, the district court was called upon to make difficult credibility determinations.  In most instances, the court found the evidence offered by the Department and Rimple to be more credible than that offered by Faltas.  We find on the record absolutely no grounds to believe that the district court ignored important evidence or that Rimple\\'s testimony was incredible on its face.  We therefore hold that the district court\\'s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Faltas also claims that the district court erred by admitting several pieces of hearsay evidence in the form of memoranda and letters critical of Faltas\\'s job performance.  Those memoranda and letters, admitted over Faltas\\'s timely objection, were written by Department employees and officials during Faltas\\'s tenure as District Director, and were offered at trial in spite of the fact that the authors were not made available for cross examination.  We review a district court\\'s ruling regarding hearsay for abuse of discretion.   See United States v. Ellis, 951 F.2d 580, 582 (4th Cir. 1991).\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      Hearsay is defined as \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).  The Department claims that the letters and memoranda were introduced at trial not to prove the truth of matters asserted in their texts-that Faltas\\'s interpersonal skills were so lacking that she was unable to perform her job properly-rather, they were introduced to prove that Faltas\\'s superior, Rimple, had received strongly worded complaints about her performance, and thus had legitimate, sex-neutral reasons for recommending that she be discharged.  The Department points out that, in order to prove her claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment, Faltas was required to show a causal link between her refusal to accede to Rimple\\'s alleged sexual advances and Rimple\\'s ultimate decision to recommend her discharge.  See discussion infra part II.B. By offering into evidence letters and memoranda in which officials complained about Faltas\\'s behavior, the Department was able to support its claim that Rimple\\'s decision to recommend Faltas\\'s discharge was based on the complaints he received, not on her refusal to accept his alleged romantic overtures.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      We agree with the Department that the letters and memoranda were introduced into evidence for the limited, non-hearsay purpose of demonstrating that Rimple had significant cause, irrespective of any alleged romantic interest, to conclude that Faltas performed her work poorly, and to recommend that she be discharged.  We therefore find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the various letters and memoranda into evidence.\\n    \\n    B\\n    \\n      21\\n      Faltas next claims that the district court erred by finding that she failed to establish a prima facie case of quid pro quo sexual harassment.  A district court\\'s determination regarding the establishment of a prima facie case contains elements of both law and fact:  the court first must establish the facts and then apply those facts to the settled law.  Inasmuch as Faltas\\'s challenge to the district court\\'s prima facie determination is based on her contention that the court misconstrued the facts, we review the district court\\'s conclusion for clear error.   See Woodard v. Lehman, 717 F.2d 909, 913 (4th Cir. 1983).\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      We have held in the past that although sexual discrimination exists in many forms, it can be categorized roughly as either hostile work environment discrimination, or quid pro quo discrimination.   Spencer v. General Electric Co., 894 F.2d 651, 658 (4th Cir. 1990).  The latter category describes the claim put forward by Faltas:  that sexual consideration was demanded by Rimple in exchange for job benefits.  Quid pro quo discrimination can be established by proving each of five prima facie elements:\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      1.  The employee belongs to a protected group.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      2. The employee was subject to unwelcome sexual harassment.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      3. The harassment complained of was based upon sex.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      4. The employee\\'s reaction to the harassment affected tangible aspects of the employee\\'s compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.  The acceptance or rejection of the harassment must be an express or implied condition to the receipt of a job benefit or cause of a tangible job detriment to create liability.  Further, as in typical disparate treatment cases, the employee must prove that she was deprived of a job benefit which she was otherwise qualified to receive because of the employer\\'s use of a prohibited criterion in making the employment decision.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      5. The employer, as defined by Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(b), knew or should have known of the harassment and took no effective remedial action.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      Once the prima facie case is established, a presumption arises that the plaintiff has suffered quid pro quo sexual harassment and the burden of production shifts to the defendant to rebut this presumption with legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment decision in question.  Id. at 659.  If the presumption is rebutted, the burden of production returns to the plaintiff to show that the defendant\\'s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons are pretextual and that the employment decision was based on a sexually discriminatory motive.  Id. Throughout this shifting scheme of evidentiary burdens the ultimate burden of persuasion remains with the plaintiff.  Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      In the instant case the district court found that Faltas failed to establish a prima facie case of quid pro quo sexual harassment, and that, as a result of this failure, the burden of production never shifted to the Department to offer a sex-neutral justification for her discharge.  Specifically, the court found that Faltas failed to offer credible evidence to support her bedrock contention that Rimple exhibited sexually suggestive behavior toward her.  To quote the district court:\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      None of the behavior described by the plaintiff was overtly sexual in nature.  The plaintiff conjured up sexual inferences in her own mind.  These inferences were not reasonable and are unsupported by the total record.  The Court did not find plaintiff to be a credible witness and specifically rejects her allegations of sexual harassment.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      Marie Assa\\'ad Faltas v. Commonwealth of Virginia, Virginia Department of Health, No. 90-00166-R, slip op. at 6 (E.D. Va. 1991).  The district court reasoned that, lacking credible evidence that Rimple subjected her to unwelcome sexual advances, Faltas could not satisfy the second element of the prima facie test of quid pro quo sexual harassment.\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      Faltas objects to the court\\'s determination on grounds that she offered evidence, in the form of her own testimony, sufficient to satisfy her burden of production on the second element of the prima facie test.  While it is true that Faltas testified on her own behalf that Rimple exhibited sexually suggestive behavior and explicitly declared his love for her, it is equally true that the district court, in carrying out its function of weighing the credibility of the evidence presented, was free to disbelieve her testimony and credit that of Rimple and other employees of the Department.  Rimple\\'s complete denial of any sexual advance was supported not only by his own testimony but by the testimony of other female and male employees, who testified that, while Rimple had a physically demonstrative way of dealing with people, his mannerisms were never regarded as sexual by those who work with him.2  In short, the district court did not commit clear error by concluding that Faltas failed to present credible evidence that Rimple subjected her to unwelcome sexual advances, and, concomitantly, that she failed to establish a prima facie case of quid pro quo sexual harassment.\\n    \\n    C\\n    \\n      34\\n      Finally, Faltas contends that the district court committed fatal error by entirely disregarding one of her central legal arguments:  that Rimple arranged for her to be discharged because she complained to him and to other superiors about his sexual harassment.  Such an employment action, if true, would constitute a retaliatory discharge forbidden by 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a).\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      An employee claiming retaliatory discharge is required initially to establish a prima facie case consisting of three elements:  (1) the employee engaged in protected activity;  (2) the employer took adverse employment action against the employee;  and (3) a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the adverse action.   Ross v. Communications Satellite Corp., 759 F.2d 355, 365 (4th Cir. 1985).  Under this prima facie test, the employee need not prove that she actually was subjected to discrimination violative of Title VII, only that she had a good faith belief that a violation occurred, complained of the violation, and, as a result, suffered an adverse employment action.  See id. at 357 n.1.  Once the prima facie case has been presented, the employer then has the burden of producing a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action, thereby rebutting the presumption of retaliation raised by the prima facie case.  Id. The employee may then offer evidence to show that the proffered nondiscriminatory justification is pretextual;  however, for the employee to disprove such a justification, she must show that the adverse action would not have occurred \"but for\" the protected conduct.   Id. at 365-66.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      Faltas is correct that the district court did not address explicitly her claim of retaliatory discharge.  However, we reject her contention that the district court\\'s failure to address her retaliation claim constitutes reversible error.\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      As a preliminary matter, it is not entirely clear that Faltas did in fact raise her claim of retaliatory discharge before the district court.  The Department contends that Faltas failed to raise her retaliation claim in her administrative challenge, and before the district court.  The Department also notes that Faltas failed at trial to bring her retaliation claim to the attention of the court.  Therefore, the Department argues, Faltas waived her retaliation claim, and this court is jurisdictionally barred from considering the argument on appeal.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      A review of Faltas\\'s pleadings reveals that the closest she came to raising a claim of retaliatory discharge was in paragraph 24 of her More Definite Statement, where she asserted that:\"as a result of her report of Rimple\\'s illegal actions, Defendant Virginia Health Department unlawfully terminated the Plaintiff\\'s employment.\"  Although this does not represent a clear statement of a claim of retaliation, this court has in the past interpreted plaintiffs\\' Title VII pleadings liberally.   See Nealon v. Stone, 958 F.2d 584, 590 (4th Cir. 1992) (\"the scope of a Title VII lawsuit may extend to any kind of discrimination like or related to the allegations contained in the charge and growing out of such allegations during the pendency of the case before the [Equal Employment Opportunity] Commission\");  see also Kotcher v.  Rosa &amp; Sullivan Appliance Center, Inc., 957 F.2d 59 (2d Cir. 1992) (plaintiff\\'s sexual harassment complaint included an allegation of retaliatory discharge, even where plaintiff never invoked the term \"retaliation\").  Thus, there is support in the law for Faltas\\'s contention that her claim of retaliatory discharge was before the district court, in spite of the fact that her pleadings did not explicitly state such a claim.\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      However, even assuming Faltas\\'s retaliation claim was presented properly to the district court, we are convinced that the court effectively disposed of the issue.  In evaluating Faltas\\'s claims of Title VII sex and national origin discrimination, the district court found as fact that \"plaintiff was not performing her job to the satisfaction of her employer.\"  The court stated that she was \"a poor manager of people,\" and was discharged because \"community confidence and employee morale plunged.\"  Given these factual determinations, determinations supported by the record as a whole, there is no conceivable possibility that Faltas could have proven a \"but for\" causal nexus between her discharge and her employer\\'s alleged retaliatory motive.  Without proof of such a causal nexus, her claim could not have succeeded.  Therefore, even though the district court did not explicitly reject Faltas\\'s claim of retaliatory discharge, we believe that such a holding was implicit in the court\\'s findings.\\n    \\n    III\\n    \\n      40\\n      The district court in this case was presented with widely divergent versions of the historical facts underlying Faltas\\'s legal claims.  Faced with this contradictory evidence, the court ably performed the difficult task of assessing credibility.  Based on our review of the record, we cannot say that the court\\'s factual determinations were clearly erroneous, and we therefore affirm the court\\'s decision.\\n    \\n    AFFIRMED\\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         The parties disagree as to the court\\'s disposition of Faltas\\'s retaliatory discharge claim.  Faltas contends that the court erred by disregarding her retaliation claim.  The Department contends that Faltas waived her retaliation claim by failing to raise it in her pleadings or at trial.  See discussion infra part II.C\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         Faltas argues that the district court erroneously relied on testimony that Rimple generally was physically demonstrative toward his colleagues.  As Faltas frames the argument, the court wrongly concluded that because Rimple treats all women as objects of his physical affection, it was acceptable for him to subject Faltas to unwelcome sexual advances\\n        If the district court had in fact formed such an inference, Faltas\\'s argument might have merit.  However, Faltas has misconstrued the evidence and the district court\\'s analysis of it.  Contrary to Faltas\\'s contention, the record contains testimony by both male and female colleagues of Rimple\\'s to the effect that he often \"touch[es] you on the shoulder,\" and has \"mannerisms of cohesion.\"  Testimony of William P. Sifford, Jr., Joint Appendix at 135.  All who testified to this effect specified that Rimple intends nothing sexual by his frequent touching.  From this sort of evidence the court was free to form the inference that, even if Faltas truly believed Rimple\\'s behavior to be sexually suggestive, her belief was unreasonable.\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 588312}]"},{"id":675121,"date_filed":"1994-07-26","judges":null,"case_name_full":"Lisa M.

Senior Judge BUTZNER wrote the opinion, in which Judge PHILLIPS and Senior Judge YOUNG joined.\\n      OPINION\\n      BUTZNER, Senior Circuit Judge:\\n    \\n    \\n      1\\n      The principal issue in this appeal is whether provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 for trial by jury to recover compensatory and punitive damages make Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the exclusive remedy for claims of employment discrimination brought by public employees.  See 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981a(a)-(b) (damages) and (c) (jury) (Supp.  IV 1992).  The district court held that Title VII was not the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination claims, 828 F.Supp. 397.  It allowed Lisa M. Beardsley, a former employee of the Loudoun County, Virginia, sheriff\\'s office, to maintain her 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 action against her supervisor, John Webb, and Sheriff John R. Isom.  From a judgment entered on the jury\\'s verdict awarding damages to Beardsley for discrimination Webb appeals.  Beardsley cross-appeals the court\\'s summary dismissal of her other claims against Webb and Isom.  Finding no reversible error among the many assigned, we affirm.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      * Webb contends that provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 that allow the recovery of damages and provide for trial by jury establish that Title VII is the sole remedy for sexual harassment.  Consequently, he argues, the 1991 Act precludes Beardsley from bringing an action under Sec. 1983 and the district court erred by denying his motion to dismiss.  He asserts that Congress intended the Act to provide sufficient remedies because its stated purpose is to provide \"appropriate remedies\" for unlawful harassment.  Pub.L. No. 102-166, Sec. 3 (codified at 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981, note (Supp.  IV 1992)).  He also points out that the Act explicitly does not limit Sec. 1981 but is silent with respect to any limitation of Sec. 1983.  See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981a(b)(4) (Supp.  IV 1992).  This omission, he claims, makes it reasonable to assume that the Act precludes suits for sexual harassment under Sec. 1983.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      This and other circuits have long recognized that prior to 1991 Congress did not intend Title VII to be the sole remedy for a public employee\\'s claim of employment discrimination.  The reasons for concluding that Congress preserved a cause of action under Sec. 1983 have often been explained;  they need not be repeated here.  See Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 48-49, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 1019-20, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974);  Keller v. Prince George\\'s County, 827 F.2d 952, 956-63 (4th Cir.1987).  In light of appellate case law that Title VII and Sec. 1983 co-exist to afford relief for employment discrimination, it is quite unlikely that Congress implicitly intended the 1991 Act to bar claimants from seeking relief under Sec. 1983.  It is more reasonable to presume that Congress intended both avenues of relief to remain open.  See Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580, 98 S.Ct. 866, 869, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978).\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      We are unable to accept Webb\\'s argument that Congress intended Title VII to be a sufficient remedy for employment discrimination.  The purpose of the Act to provide \"appropriate\" remedies must be read along with the congressional finding that \"additional remedies under Federal law are needed to deter unlawful harassment and intentional discrimination in the workplace.\"   Pub.L. No. 102-166, Sec. 2 (codified as 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981, note (Supp.  IV 1992)).  It would be perverse to conclude that the Congress that provided additional remedies simultaneously intended silently to extinguish the remedy that Sec. 1983 has provided for many years.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Also misplaced is Webb\\'s contrast of the savings clause for Sec. 1981 with the absence of a similar clause for Sec. 1983 to buttress his claim that Congress implicitly abolished remedies that Sec. 1983 had previously afforded.  The 1991 Act overruled Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989), which limited Sec. 1981 by excluding from its scope conduct that occurs after the formation of a contract.  491 U.S. at 175-85, 109 S.Ct. at 2371-77;  see 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981(b) and (c) (Supp.  IV 1992).  Congressional concern with the scope of relief underSec. 1981 does not establish that Congress intended to limit the scope of relief under Sec. 1983.  See Stoner v. Department of Agriculture, 846 F.Supp. 738, 740-41 (W.D. Wis.1994).\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Webb\\'s argument that the remedies the 1991 Act added to Title VII obviate the need for the remedies afforded by Sec. 1983 is based on a flawed premise.  Title VII and Sec. 1983 are not co-extensive in every respect.  For example, Title VII does not apply to employers with less than 15 employees.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e(b).  Section 1983 contains no similar limitation.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      In Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., the Court observed:\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      [T]he legislative history of Title VII manifests a congressional intent to allow an individual to pursue independently his rights under both Title VII and other applicable state and federal statutes.  The clear inference is that Title VII was designed to supplement, rather than supplant, existing laws and institutions relating to employment discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      415 U.S. at 48-49, 94 S.Ct. at 1019-20 (citation omitted).  Nothing in the text of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 or in its legislative history contradicts the Court\\'s recognition that Title VII does not supplant Sec. 1983.  See also Stoner, 846 F.Supp. 738;  contra Marrero-Rivera v. Department of Justice of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 800 F.Supp. 1024 (D.P.R.1992).  The district court properly denied Webb\\'s motion to dismiss.\\n    \\n    II\\n    \\n      10\\n      Beardsley began working for the Loudoun County, Virginia, sheriff\\'s office in 1984.  She was promoted to Field Operations Sergeant in 1988 and to Second Lieutenant in 1989, becoming the highest ranking female in the department.  First Lieutenant Webb supervised Beardsley in 1991 from the summer to October.  No incidents occurred during this period.  Webb again supervised Beardsley from March 1992 until Beardsley resigned in August 1992.  The incidents that prompted Beardsley\\'s lawsuit occurred during this period.  Because the jury returned a verdict in Beardsley\\'s favor, we review the evidence on this issue in the light most favorable to her.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      In May 1992, Webb called Beardsley \"honey\" and \"dear\" in front of subordinates.  Beardsley asked Webb to stop using these terms.  Shortly after these encounters, Webb stood behind Beardsley during roll call and touched her shoulders.  When Beardsley informed him that the touching made her and her husband, a member of the department who was present at roll call, uncomfortable, Webb massaged her shoulders while staring at Beardsley\\'s husband.  For a period of time after this incident, whenever Beardsley arranged on her car radio to meet with a deputy, Webb would show up at the meeting without an apparent professional purpose.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Webb unjustifiably accused Beardsley of having an affair with a deputy, Sergeant Noble.  When Beardsley offered to drive Noble to an automobile repair shop to pick up a patrol car, Webb stated that this was an excuse for her and Noble to \"kiss face\" in the parking lot.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Webb asked Beardsley what kind of underwear she wore.  She responded that it was none of his business.  Webb retorted that he \"was just wondering how something so small could be so comfortable.\"   On another occasion, when Beardsley indicated she was planning on taking maternity leave, Webb asked her why she would want to do that to her body.  He then asked what type of birth control she used.  Beardsley protested to Webb that these questions and comments were inappropriate.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      When Webb had to pick up his patrol car from the repair shop, he insisted that Beardsley drive him because \"it was his turn to make out in the parking lot\" with Beardsley.  She told him that his statement was not funny.  After another officer offered to drive him, Webb repeated that it was his turn to have his way with her.  Webb ordered Beardsley to drive him and she complied.  During the drive, Beardsley reiterated that Webb\\'s behavior was not funny and that she did not want to have to put up with it.  Webb responded that she had chosen to work \"in a field primarily occupied by men\" and that if she didn\\'t like it she could \"just get out.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      Webb\\'s behavior then changed.  Instead of giving her unwanted attention, Webb gave her the cold shoulder.  When he did talk to her, he was curt.  He regularly criticized her performance.  He questioned her orders.  When she confronted him about his conduct, he initially just stared at her and then accused her of having no sense of humor.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      At this point, Beardsley met with Sheriff Isom to complain about Webb\\'s behavior.  Webb did not change.  Her squad began to become insubordinate, bypassing the chain of command and reporting only to Webb.  Webb in turn bypassed Beardsley to give orders directly to her deputies, hampering her efforts to run her shift.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      Beardsley again complained to Sheriff Isom.  She also met with Webb who tried to persuade her to drop her complaint against him.  She did not, and matters went from bad to worse.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      In response to a question that requested Beardsley to tell the jury why she quit, Beardsley testified:\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      Lieutenant John Webb specifically turned three complaints that we have already been over here around on me.  He wrote an investigation requesting internal affairs on me with several fictitious facts and outright lies.  He said there were witnesses to things that weren\\'t there and that will testify today that they never talked to John Webb and never said that.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      After that was turned on me and John Webb was the one responsible for initially investigating the incident between Sergeant Williams and I, they turned that around on me as well, and I didn\\'t think I was getting a fair shake in that department.  I didn\\'t think I was ever going to get a fair shake anymore.  They wanted me out.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      I made a complaint on John Webb, and they weren\\'t going to investigate it, but they were certainly going to investigate me.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      The three complaints and the Sergeant Williams incident to which Beardsley referred involved her attempts to discipline members of her squad.  The evidence discloses that Webb did not treat others whom he supervised in the manner that he treated Beardsley.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Beardsley brought this action against Webb and the sheriff, alleging in her Sec. 1983 claim harassment and discrimination because of her sex in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and several claims based on state law.  The district court granted the sheriff summary judgment and dismissed some of the state law claims.  Beardsley voluntarily withdrew other state law claims.  A jury was impanelled to try her Sec. 1983 claim against Webb.  It returned a verdict in her favor for $76,044 compensatory damages and $8,000 punitive damages.  The district court entered judgment on the verdict and denied Webb\\'s postjudgment motions.  Webb appeals this judgment, and Beardsley cross-appeals the district court\\'s adverse summary judgment dismissing her state law claims and dismissing her claims against the sheriff.\\n    \\n    III\\n    \\n      24\\n      Webb asserts that Beardsley\\'s evidence failed to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment.  He argues that the judge erred as a matter of law by submitting the claim to the jury.  He also contends that the court should have dismissed Beardsley\\'s claim of retaliation because she did not allege a violation of the First Amendment.  Webb asserts the defense of qualified immunity and that Beardsley was not entitled to punitive damages as a matter of law.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      The equal protection clause confers a right to be free from gender discrimination that is not substantially related to important governmental objectives.  Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 234-35, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 2271, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979).  Applying this precept, courts have held that intentional sexual harassment of employees by persons acting under color of state law violates the Fourteenth Amendment and is actionable underSec. 1983.  See, e.g., Pontarelli v. Stone, 930 F.2d 104, 113-14 (1st Cir.1991);  Bohen v. City of East Chicago, 799 F.2d 1180, 1185 (7th Cir.1986).  Courts may apply the standards developed in Title VII litigation to similar litigation under Sec. 1983.  See Boutros v. Canton Regional Transit Auth., 997 F.2d 198, 202-03 (6th Cir.1993);  Trautvetter v. Quick, 916 F.2d 1140, 1149 (7th Cir.1990).\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Sexual harassment creating a hostile or abusive atmosphere in the workplace gives rise to a claim of sex discrimination under Title VII.  Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 66, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2405, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986).  To violate Title VII, conduct must be \"sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\\'s employment and create an abusive working environment.\"  477 U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405 (citations, internal brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted).  Whether a party has established a hostile working environment under Title VII \"can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances, [including] the frequency of the discriminatory conduct;  its severity;  whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance;  and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\\'s work performance.\"  Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 367, 371, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993).\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      Webb\\'s sexual innuendos and proposals together with his other discriminatory conduct were sufficiently severe and pervasive to make out a sexual harassment claim.  In combination, his acts altered the conditions of Beardsley\\'s employment and created an objectively abusive work environment.  See Harris, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 370.   Beardsley\\'s relationship with her subordinates and then with her supervisors suffered from the continued pattern of Webb\\'s discriminatory comments and behavior that undermined her standing and authority in the department.  Webb\\'s conduct caused her to suffer severe depression requiring professional treatment.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      Webb offered defenses of denial, self-justification, characterization of conduct as jokes not harassment, and alternative reasons for Beardsley\\'s dissatisfaction and departure.  Whether the evidence supported Beardsley\\'s claim or Webb\\'s defenses depended largely on the credibility of the witnesses and the inferences the jury could reasonably draw from the facts.  Whether Webb\\'s \"harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive is quintessentially a question of fact.\"  Paroline v. Unisys Corp., 879 F.2d 100, 105 (4th Cir.1989), vacated in part on other grounds 900 F.2d 27 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc).\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      Webb\\'s claim that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish a prima facie case and to sustain the verdict lacks merit.  Beardsley satisfied the standards set forth in Meritor and Harris.   The district court did not err by denying Webb\\'s motions for judgment that he submitted during and after the trial.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      We also conclude that Beardsley\\'s sole reliance on the Fourteenth Amendment without reference to an infringement of the First Amendment is not fatal to her claim of retaliation.  A violation of the First Amendment\\'s protection of the right to speak out is a necessary predicate to a claim of pure retaliation in the context of adverse employment action after the claimant has voiced a grievance.  See, e.g., Gray v. Lacke, 885 F.2d 399 (7th Cir.1989).\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      Beardsley\\'s claim of retaliation is that Webb continued to discriminate against her after she related to the sheriff Webb\\'s overt sexual harassment.  Having been criticized by his superiors, he no longer made sexual advances, but his discriminatory conduct continued.  He treated her adversely unlike the way he treated men subject to his command.  Webb\\'s conduct after his superiors censured him was a mixture of retaliation and continued sexual harassment.  Webb\\'s refusal to speak to her and his use of sergeants to relay orders was not consistent with the professional relationship of a superior officer and his subordinate.  Instead, it was more like the conduct of a spurned suitor.  His conduct maintained and reinforced the hostile work environment that he had created.  Under these circumstances, the district court did not err by including retaliation among the issues submitted to the jury.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987), explains the standards that govern the defense of qualified immunity:\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      [W]hether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the \"objective legal reasonableness\" of the action ... assessed in light of the legal rules that were \"clearly established\" at the time it was taken....\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      483 U.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. at 3038 (citations omitted).  The Court emphasized that the right must be clearly established in a particularized relevant sense:\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.  This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful ... but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. at 3039 (citations omitted).\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      The issue, therefore, is whether an officer could reasonably have thought, in light of clearly established law, that Webb\\'s conduct was consistent with Beardsley\\'s rights to be free from discrimination.  See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 638, 107 S.Ct. at 3038.   The test is objective;  Webb\\'s subjective beliefs about the propriety of his conduct are irrelevant.  See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      Webb\\'s conduct occurred during the period from March to August 1992.  We have already noted that in 1978 the Supreme Court wrote that the equal protection clause confers on a public employee a federal constitutional right to be free from gender discrimination, Davis v. Passman, 442 US. at 234-35, 99 S.Ct. at 2271, and that sexual harassment has long been recognized to be a type of gender discrimination.  See Bohen v. City of East Chicago, 799 F.2d at 1185.   There is no need to recount all of Webb\\'s conduct.  No male officer could reasonably have thought in 1992 that it was not sexual harassment to announce that it was his turn to make out with a woman who was subject to his command, especially when the woman had previously protested his gender oriented behavior.  We conclude that the district court did not err in denying Webb qualified immunity.\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      The district court granted summary judgment to Sheriff Isom on all counts against him including constructive discharge.  Webb contends that he is not liable for constructive discharge because he was not Beardsley\\'s employer.\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      The district court did not impose liability on Webb for constructive discharge.  The district court ruled that while constructive discharge was not an issue in the jury trial, the question of causation remained, and Beardsley could show that the reason she resigned was because of Webb\\'s actions.  In its instructions the court cautioned the jury that Webb was not responsible for harm to Beardsley caused by others and that she must prove that her damages were proximately caused by Webb.  We find no error in the court\\'s ruling or its instructions.\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      We cannot accept Webb\\'s argument that Beardsley is not entitled to punitive damages as a matter of law.  The court instructed the jury that they could only award punitive damages if they found the defendant\\'s acts were malicious or wanton or oppressive or willful.  The court also explained that an act is maliciously done if prompted by ill will, spite, or grudge;  that it is willful or wanton if done in reckless or careless disregard of or indifference to the rights of another person;  and that it is oppressively done if it injures another by unnecessary harshness or severity as by misuse of power or authority.  Webb offered no objection to the definitions in these instructions.\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      Webb\\'s conduct was sufficiently egregious to create a question for the jury to determine whether it met the standards for punitive damages outlined by the court.  After Beardsley remonstrated with Webb about his conduct toward her, he said that she chose to work in a field occupied primarily by men, and if she didn\\'t like it she could \"just get out.\"   When Beardsley did not \"get out\" the evidence of his subsequent conduct to get her out amply justified the jury\\'s award of punitive damages.\\n    \\n    IV\\n    \\n      43\\n      Webb also argues that Bockes v. Fields, 999 F.2d 788 (4th Cir.1993), mandates that we grant him immunity under the Eleventh Amendment because he is insured through the Virginia State Division of Risk Management Insurance Plan.  In Bockes, we held that a local board and department of social services were agencies immune under the Eleventh Amendment because their liability would be covered by insurance for which Virginia paid 80% of the premium.  999 F.2d at 790-91.\\n    \\n    \\n      44\\n      In contrast, the claim on which Beardsley prevailed was not brought against an agency or an officer in his official capacity.  It was brought against Webb in his individual capacity.  \"[T]he Eleventh Amendment does not erect a barrier against suits to impose \\'individual and personal liability\\' on state officials under Sec. 1983.\"  Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, ----, 112 S.Ct. 358, 364, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991) (citation omitted).  Several courts have held that despite state indemnification the Eleventh Amendment does not bar actions against officers sued in their individual capacity.  See, e.g., Jackson v. Georgia Dept. of Transp., 16 F.3d 1573, 1577-78 (11th Cir.1994);  Griess v. Colorado, 841 F.2d 1042, 1046-47 (10th Cir.1988);  Duckworth v. Franzen, 780 F.2d 645, 650-51 (7th Cir.1985);  Demery v. Kupperman, 735 F.2d 1139, 1147 (9th Cir.1984);  Downing v. Williams, 624 F.2d 612, 626 (5th Cir.1980), vacated on other grounds, 645 F.2d 1226 (5th Cir.1981).\\n    \\n    \\n      45\\n      Moreover, Webb has failed to prove that state funds are involved.  The question of insurance arose after judgment when the question of a supersedeas bond to secure the judgment against Webb was submitted to the court.  In a motion to stay enforcement of the judgment Webb\\'s counsel stated:[T]he defendant is covered, for both the compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to attorneys\\' fees and costs, by a state funded risk management plan up to the limit of $1,000,000.00.  This coverage will be more than adequate to cover any principal verdict on appeal plus costs and attorneys\\' fees.\\n    \\n    \\n      46\\n      Notably, Webb did not cite any statute to support his representation about the insurance being state funded.  Beardsley, nevertheless, accepted the representation, and the parties stipulated that a supersedeas bond was unnecessary.  Now Webb has reversed course, claiming that the Eleventh Amendment bars this action because, in his opinion, he will be indemnified by the state.  Again he cites no statute and no case that supports his argument.\\n    \\n    \\n      47\\n      Webb is not a Virginia state policeman.  He is a deputy sheriff of Loudoun County.  Beardsley has shown that the indemnification provided to Webb is governed by Virginia Code Sec. 2.1-526.8:1 (1987).  This statute provides for voluntary coverage of local subdivisions and their constitutional officers.  Premiums and costs for insurance are paid by the participating governmental entities.  They are not paid by the state.  Webb cites no authority to the contrary.  The immunity conferred by the Eleventh Amendment does not \"afford protection to political subdivisions such as counties....\"  Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 401, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 1177, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979).\\n    \\n    \\n      48\\n      Webb has failed to show that this action is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\\n    \\n    V\\n    \\n      49\\n      We find no cause for reversal in the errors Beardsley assigned in her cross-appeal.\\n    \\n    \\n      50\\n      The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\\n    \\n    \\n      51\\n      AFFIRMED.\\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 675121}]"},{"id":203425,"date_filed":"2008-08-07","judges":"Lynch, O'Connor, Torruella","case_name_full":"Abraham PHILIP, Plaintiff, Appellant, v.

Sharp with whom Elaine Whitfield Sharp and Whitfield Sharp &amp; Sharp were on brief for appellant.\\nMary O\\'Neil, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief for appellee.\\nBefore LYNCH, Chief Judge, O\\'CONNOR,[*] Associate Justice, and TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.\\nLYNCH, Chief Judge.\\nThe Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Massachusetts has had a troubled history. This lawsuit is brought by a disgruntled former contract medical examiner, Dr. Abraham Philip, against the administrator of that office, John Cronin.\\nIn November of 2000 the National Association of Medical Examiners (\"NAME\") conducted an audit and filed a report critical of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for Massachusetts (\"OCME\"). (OCME had requested the audit.) The report called OCME\\'s facilities \"woefully inadequate\" and detailed insufficient staffing, *28 unacceptable delays, and other difficulties in the office.\\nIn March of 2003, John Cronin was brought on as the Chief Administrator of OCME and charged with improving the office, including mending OCME\\'s public reputation. During Cronin\\'s tenure, plaintiff Abraham Philip was employed as a medical examiner under a ten-month contract starting on September 2, 2003. That contract required Dr. Philip to \"adhere to the highest ethical standards and serve as a role model for all other OCME employees.\" He had worked for the agency in the past.\\nCronin terminated Dr. Philip\\'s contract on March 3, 2004. Dr. Philip sued Cronin in his personal capacity, claiming the termination was in retaliation for two letters criticizing OCME that Dr. Philip had sent to the governor and therefore violated his First Amendment rights. Cronin denied that accusation and pointed to several troubling incidents during Dr. Philip\\'s employment as the cause for the contract termination.\\nThe case went to trial. After the close of plaintiff\\'s evidence, and on defendant\\'s motion, the trial judge entered a directed verdict for Cronin. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). The judge did so \"essentially for the reasons and rationale set forth\" in defendant\\'s memorandum of law in support of his Rule 50(a) motion. Cronin, in his memorandum to the district court, had primarily argued (1) that no reasonable fact finder could conclude that Dr. Philip\\'s critical speech regarding OCME was the motivating factor in the termination of his employment, (2) that Dr. Philip\\'s employment would have been terminated regardless of his speech on a matter of public concern, and (3) that Cronin was entitled to qualified immunity.[1] Of these rationales, we find the last \\x97 qualified immunity \\x97 sufficient to sustain the trial court\\'s Rule 50(a) judgment.\\n\\nI.\\nDr. Philip was, depending on one\\'s point of view, either a constant complainer or a constant seeker of improvement in the OCME. He freely used emails and memos to communicate his ideas to Cronin. Cronin did meet with Dr. Philip at least twice in January 2004, for a couple of hours each time, to discuss these suggestions. Many of Dr. Philip\\'s concerns had been highlighted in the NAME report from two years earlier. As to Dr. Philip\\'s new ideas, Cronin did follow up on some.\\nStarting in February 2004, there was a series of incidents which had later consequences. The first incident involved the contamination of a death certificate. On February 13, 2004, a funeral home brought a death certificate back to OCME because it had not been properly signed; because the autopsy had been conducted by Dr. Philip, Cronin sent an administrative assistant, Leslie Ward, to obtain Dr. Philip\\'s signature on the certificate.\\nDr. Philip, in the midst of another autopsy, did not want to be interrupted and essentially told Leslie Ward to tell the funeral home to wait an hour until he took a break. She relayed that message to Cronin; at Cronin\\'s request, Leslie Ward\\'s supervisor, Deirdre Ward, went down to see Dr. Philip, bearing the unsigned certificate and a request that he sign it. This *29 time Dr. Philip did sign it, but in doing so got blood on the certificate. Dr. Philip testified that he placed the bloody certificate on a table to deal with later, but that the technician took it away while Dr. Philip was finishing his autopsy. (Deirdre Ward told Cronin that Dr. Philip had handed the bloodied certificate directly to her.) Deirdre Ward brought the certificate to Cronin and told him it had been \"dripping with blood\" when she received it. Cronin told Deirdre Ward to place it into a sleeve, recognizing the bloody certificate to be a biohazard. Cronin then explained what happened to Dr. Richard Evans, the Chief Medical Examiner. According to Cronin, Dr. Evans was shocked and disgusted by Dr. Philip\\'s unprofessional behavior.\\nCronin investigated and took statements from four employees involved in the incident, who confirmed the events outlined. Dr. Philip\\'s autopsy assistant was not questioned about the incident. Cronin then consulted his superiors at the Executive Office of Public Safety (\"EOPS\"), EOPS Undersecretary Robert Hass and EOPS Chief of Staff Jane Tewksbury. They discussed the written statements and the range of possible disciplinary actions. Dr. Evans also provided his views.\\nIn Cronin\\'s view, the lack of signature on the original certificate was not directly Dr. Philip\\'s fault, but Dr. Philip\\'s response was inappropriate. Dr. Philip had larger administrative and safety responsibilities, and the group decided some discipline was appropriate. The decision was made to suspend Dr. Philip for one day to \"get his attention and make him realize that he need[ed] to be part of this recovery of this medical\/legal system that [OCME was] looking to build from a professional ground up.\" The suspension was brief in light of the staffing shortage at OCME. Cronin\\'s superiors instructed Cronin to convey that disciplinary decision to Dr. Philip.\\nThat same day, February 25, Cronin met with Dr. Philip to hear his version of events. This effort was unsuccessful. Dr. Philip became agitated and left Cronin\\'s office in anger, yelling at him. As Dr. Philip left, Cronin handed him a disciplinary action letter, dated February 25, 2004, that read:\\nPlease let this correspondence serve to notify you that as a result of your actions on Friday February 13, 2004 at approximately 12:30pm, you are suspended without pay for one day. Your suspension is to be served on Thursday March 4, 2004.\\nThe events, as described by four witnesses, reveal that you abruptly accepted a death certificate for your signature while you were performing an autopsy on a homicide victim. You then, without comment, handed the document back to Ms. Deirdre Ward with \"blood dripping from it\". A copy of the soiled document is attached.\\nYour actions exposed a co-worker to a potentially hazardous situation without any explanation. The document was also rendered \"destroyed\" thereby causing embarrassment and inconvenience to this office, the funeral home that transported the document, the burial agent that signed the original for burial of the decedent back in January 2004, and the Natick Town Hall Clerk\\'s office.\\nPlease understand that your actions are very disturbing and are determined to be completely unacceptable.\\nAny future occurrence of unprofessional or unacceptable behavior will result in immediate termination of your contracted services pursuant to the Terms and Conditions of the contract you have endorsed with this office.\\nAt trial, Dr. Philip acknowledged he knew he was on shaky ground in terms of his continued employment once he got this *30 letter. Dr. Philip\\'s view of the incident was that he should not have been asked to sign a certificate while he was in the midst of an autopsy, that he believed he was given no choice but to sign the certificate immediately, that the funeral home could have waited an hour for him to take a preplanned break, or that some other medical examiner could have been found to sign in his place.\\nCronin, on the other hand, testified that he had not viewed Dr. Philip as a discipline problem before the bloody autopsy report, although Dr. Philip had made a number of negative comments to Cronin, derisively calling him a \"control freak\" and \"Mr. Administrator.\" Cronin explained that no one other than Dr. Philip and Dr. Evans could have signed the certificate; that Cronin was attempting to provide polite and quick service to the funeral home to help repair OCME\\'s negative bureaucratic reputation; that Deirdre Ward was instructed to ask, not command, Dr. Philip to sign the certificate; and that neither Deirdre Ward nor Leslie Ward, to the best of Cronin\\'s knowledge, violated standard operating procedures by entering the autopsy suite.\\nThe next incident concerns emails about evidence from a child homicide prosecution, including the \"urinate\/fart\" email. On February 25, Jackie Faherty, general counsel for OCME, informed Dr. Philip that a court had issued an order requiring his notes relating to the death and autopsy of a child homicide victim be preserved. Dr. Philip was working on a report for the case, but the charts were in Faherty\\'s possession. On February 27, Dr. Philip replied to Faherty that he was working on the draft of his report and needed the entire case folder that was in her possession.\\nOn February 29, an Assistant District Attorney (\"ADA\") handling the child homicide case emailed Dr. Philip informing him that the court had ordered preservation of all of Dr. Philip\\'s records in the case and asking about the report. By email, dated March 1, Dr. Philip replied to the ADA:\\nI finalized the report on [name redacted], a few corrections have to be made, which my secretary will do early this morning. My problem is I cannot find the original charts on this case, to check if everything else is okay. The last I heard the file was with Jackie Faherty, and she locked it in her office and has been away on Thursday and Friday.\\nThere are some other very bizarre events going on in the office with weird accusations being levelled against me. So when you arrange with Jackie Faherty to hand over the file to me, please insist that a witness be present in the room to prevent weird charges of having urinated on the chart or farted while working on the chart being levelled against me by the head honcho who runs this agency.\\n(emphasis added).\\nDr. Philip explained his statements in the email as reflecting his reaction to what he felt was the earlier unfair discipline imposed on him for the bloody death certificate.\\nThe ADA was concerned about this email and contacted Cronin, who, in turn, contacted Faherty. Faherty expressed concern that the email might well be a discoverable document, which could become public. If so, it would greatly embarrass the agency.\\nOn March 2, Faherty left the main case file on Dr. Philip\\'s chair and so informed him by email. In response, Dr. Philip sent her this email, dated March 2:\\nNote my fervent prayers to you in what I thought was plain english was to hand over the files in the presence of a witness, *31 and arrange to have a witness present while completing the autopsy report and checking the file. I was down in the autopsy rooms and evaluating a brain when some one sneaked in and left the files on my chair. In order to avoid any contamination of the file, they have been left out on the table in the corridor, till a witness can be arranged.\\nThis email also caused concerns.\\nThat same day, Faherty took these emails and her concerns to Cronin, and later that day they went to Dr. Philip\\'s office to deliver the child homicide file in person. Cronin testified that he \"put the file on [Dr. Philip\\'s] desk and said finish your work, please,\" though he also described becoming upset at Dr. Philip\\'s antagonistic response. Dr. Philip testified that Cronin threw the file on Philip\\'s desk in a threatening manner, told him to finish the work, and that \"enough was enough.\"\\nMeanwhile, on March 1, Dr. Philip had sent a letter to then-Governor Mitt Romney that criticized OCME on numerous grounds, which were not limited to the issues NAME had identified earlier. The letter opens \"I write to alert you to serious deficiencies in the [OCME].\" It appears that this letter was sent after Dr. Philip sent the urinate\/fart email.\\nOn March 2, 2004, after he sent the urinate\/fart email, Dr. Philip circulated a memo internally via email; he sent the same memo to the governor on March 3 (but with a cover letter bearing the date of March 1). This is the \"Joshua memo.\" Dr. Philip\\'s cover letter to the governor explained he was writing \"to alert [the governor] to serious issue [sic] regarding organ procurement.\" The Joshua memo arose out of Dr. Philip\\'s concerns about what he believed was an inappropriate organ harvesting procedure. He had declined to harvest organs from a candidate donor using this procedure on January 30, 2004; Dr. Evans eventually approved the use of the procedure on that candidate, contrary to Dr. Philip\\'s express recommendation. The Joshua memo called for more open discussion about the legal and ethical implications of this procedure \"so that everybody is comfortable with the decisions taken.\"\\nThe decision to terminate Dr. Philip\\'s contract was made at a March 3 meeting comprised of EOPS Undersecretary Hass, Chief of Staff Tewksbury, Dr. Evans, Cronin, and perhaps one or two others. Cronin testified the group discussed \"the latest round of bizarre activity\" by Dr. Philip and his deteriorating behavior at the agency. Cronin testified that the discussion touched on the Joshua memo and the two letters Dr. Philip had sent to the governor, but these items were not the \"thrust\" of the conversation and did not inform their primary discussion or final decision. Rather, \"the focus of the discussion\" was Dr. Philip\\'s behavioral issues, especially \"Dr. Philip\\'s behavior within the office place related to [the] email that he had sent to [the] assistant district attorney.\" This behavior was considered in light of the bloody death certificate incident. Chief of Staff Tewksbury took the position that Dr. Philip had to go. That was the general consensus and final decision of the group.\\nCronin agreed with the contract termination decision; his only reservation was that the office was already understaffed and they could not afford to lose another examiner. Cronin believed he had no discretion, after the group decision, not to terminate Dr. Philip\\'s contract. He spoke with OCME\\'s human resources director and asked her to prepare a termination letter. He told her the letter should focus on Dr. Philip\\'s breach of his contractual *32 obligation to meet the highest standards of conduct.\\nThe letter terminating Dr. Philip\\'s contract is dated March 3, 2004, and states:\\nOn February 25, 2004, you were notified that any occurrence of unprofessional or unacceptable behavior would result in the immediate termination of your contracted services pursuant to the Terms and Conditions of the contract you endorsed with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Due to continued instances of misconduct, your contract is hereby terminated for cause, effective immediately.\\nAs you are aware, your contract required you to demonstrate high standards of conduct. Explicit in your duties was a requirement that you adhere to the highest ethical standards and serve as a role model for all other OCME employees. Your conduct on or about March 1st and 2nd, 2004, which included unprofessional and inappropriate communications with members of the OCME and a district attorney\\'s office do not comport with this requirement and constitute a breach of your contract.\\nChronologically, Dr. Philip\\'s contract was terminated less than seventy-two hours after his March 1 letter to the governor, his release of the Joshua memo on March 2, and his March 3 transmittal of the Joshua memo to the governor. Dr. Philip bases his First Amendment claims on these documents. He argues the letters were discussed during the March 3 termination meeting, as Cronin admitted, and were things of consequence. Cronin testified there were two reasons for the termination: the bloody death certificate and the urinate\/fart email. From this, Dr. Philip argues that the termination letter was inconsistent and that qualified immunity cannot be granted in the face of inconsistent reasons from the defendant.\\n\\nII.\\nOur review of the grant of judgment for defendant at trial is de novo. Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hern\u00e1ndez, 447 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir.2006). We take all facts and inferences in plaintiff\\'s favor. Id.\\nAfter the trial in this case, the Supreme Court shed further light on First Amendment claims brought by public employees in Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). As we have recognized, Garcetti somewhat modifies the prior test articulated under Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). Curran v. Cousins, 509 F.3d 36, 44-45 (1st Cir.2007).\\nIf the court decides, as the trial court did here, that the \"employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern,\" then under Garcetti, we consider whether there was \"adequate justification\":\\nThe question becomes whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public. This consideration reflects the importance of the relationship between the speaker\\'s expressions and employment. A government entity has broader discretion to restrict speech when it acts in its role as employer, but the restrictions it imposes must be directed at speech that has some potential to affect the entity\\'s operations.\\nId. at 45 (quoting Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951).\\nTo prove retaliation, plaintiff must also establish a causal connection between the speech and the adverse employment action, here that Dr. Philip\\'s speech was the substantial or motivating factor in his *33 firing. Torres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2003); see also Curran, 509 F.3d at 45.\\nIn addition, where a plaintiff seeks the relief of monetary damages against state officials, as here, plaintiff must overcome the qualified immunity defense of those officials, a defense which protects their reasonable judgments. Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep\\'t, 315 F.3d 65, 69 (1st Cir.2002). This case raises both the Garcetti doctrine and the doctrine of qualified immunity.\\n\\nA. First Amendment Claim\\n\\nIt is undisputed that Dr. Philip\\'s speech in the Joshua memo was on a matter of public concern. To the extent that the district court entered a directed verdict on the basis that no jury could reasonably conclude that the Joshua memo was a substantial or a motivating factor in the decision to terminate Dr. Philip\\'s contract, we disagree. We discuss the point for its value in future cases.\\nA trial judge faced with a motion for a directed verdict must take the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, including drawing all inferences in plaintiff\\'s favor. Acevedo-Feliciano, 447 F.3d at 121.\\nThe test is not what the jury verdict is likely to be. Here, taking all the evidence in plaintiff\\'s favor, we think there was sufficient evidence of a causal and a motivating relationship between the First Amendment protected speech and the termination for the retaliation claim to survive a Rule 50(a) motion.\\nThere is a great deal of temporal proximity here between the protected conduct and the employer\\'s action. Cf. DeCaire v. Mukasey, 530 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2008) (evidence of temporal proximity may be sufficient to make out a prima facie case of retaliation for exercise of rights protected under Title VII). Defendant Cronin testified that at the March 3 meeting where the decision to terminate Dr. Philip\\'s employment was made, the March 1 letter from Dr. Philip to the governor and the Joshua memo were discussed. Cronin and the other participants were certainly aware of these letters at the March 3 meeting. Further, the termination letter itself refers to Dr. Philip\\'s \"conduct on or about March 1 and 2,\" although it specifically notes his \"unprofessional and inappropriate communications with members of the OCME and a district attorney\\'s office\" in connection with those dates. While the evidence was strong that it was Dr. Philip\\'s behavior with respect to the bloody death certificate and the urinate\/fart email which caused his dismissal, we cannot say that no reasonable jury could have concluded there was no causal relationship with the March 1 letter and the Joshua memo. Dr. Philip had made a number of highly critical comments about the agency before March 1, but on March 1, March 2, and March 3, he made critical comments to persons outside of OCME, unlike his earlier behavior. A jury could have concluded that it was this going outside the agency with his criticisms that was at least a motivating factor in Dr. Philip\\'s firing.[2] It was also possible for a jury to conclude that there was an overreaction to Dr. Philip\\'s exercise of poor judgment in his urinate\/fart email, despite the prior discipline, which is best explained as retaliation for his protected speech.\\n\\nB. Qualified Immunity\\n\\nRegardless, we have no doubt that Cronin, the sole defendant in this case, is *34 entitled to qualified immunity. Such immunity provides a shield \"to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\" Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986). \"We use a three-part test to determine whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity\": \"whether the plaintiff\\'s allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation,\" \"whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation,\" and \"whether a reasonable officer, similarly situated, would understand that the challenged conduct violated that established right.\" Suboh v. Dist. Attorney\\'s Office, 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir.2002).\\nWe will take it as clearly established here that a public employee has limited First Amendment rights of speech on matters of public concern under Garcetti, Pickering, and a host of other cases, and that on plaintiff\\'s version of the facts, a First Amendment violation is stated. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (violation of constitutional right is threshold question in qualified immunity analysis).[3]\\nNonetheless, even if a constitutional right is clearly established, the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity so long as a reasonable official in Cronin\\'s position could believe, albeit mistakenly, that his conduct did not violate the First Amendment. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 819, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); Dirrane, 315 F.3d at 69. This is an objective test: Cronin is entitled to immunity so long as he reasonably could have believed on the facts before him that no violation existed. Dirrane, 315 F.3d at 69.\\nThe evidence at trial was that the contract termination decision was made not by Cronin alone, but in conjunction with Cronin\\'s superiors at the Executive Office of Public Safety.\\nCronin could quite reasonably believe that this collective decision did not violate Philip\\'s First Amendment rights. By the time plaintiff rested at trial, it was clear that these decisionmakers had reasons unrelated to Dr. Philip\\'s protected speech to fire him, and he admitted that he had committed the acts of concern. Before March 3, Dr. Philip had already engaged in inappropriate behavior in exposing people to risk with the bloody death certificate. He had been warned that further inappropriate conduct could lead to immediate termination, yet within days, he behaved inappropriately again. He did not accept responsibility for his actions, but rejected it angrily when asked to explain himself. Not only was the email to the ADA intemperate and unprofessional, but it also posed a risk of further embarrassing an office trying to regain its reputation for professionalism and confidence. See Flomenbaum v. Commonwealth, 451 Mass. 740, 889 N.E.2d 423, 428-30 (2008) (upholding \"for cause\" removal of Chief Medical Examiner on evidence of incidents which in the view of the EOPS Secretary \"had damaged the integrity and reputation of [OCME], and which could have been avoided\").\\nFurther, Cronin could reasonably conclude that terminating Dr. Philip\\'s contract would curtail the potential for further harm to the office. \"Even if this reasoning were mistaken, it would not have been egregiously so and, accordingly, qualified immunity is available.\" Wagner v. City of Holyoke, 404 F.3d 504, 509 (1st Cir.2005); *35 see also id. (\"Wagner\\'s broad range of complaints (some consisting of unprotected and antagonistic speech), coupled with his disregard of confidentiality protocols and his disobedience in following the department\\'s chain of command, would have permitted a reasonable superior officer to believe that he was entitled to discipline Wagner regardless of the content of his speech, consistent with the protections of the first amendment.\"); Dirrane, 315 F.3d at 71 (reasonable police officer would not necessarily have known he was acting unconstitutionally in transferring officer who made repeated and disruptive allegations of wrongdoing against his fellow officers, submitted a \"morass\" of complaints, and had shown poor judgment).\\n\\nIII.\\nOn this basis, the judgment is affirmed.\\nNOTES\\n[*]  The Hon. Sandra Day O\\'Connor, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\\n[1]  It appears that although defendant claimed qualified immunity as an affirmative defense in his answer to plaintiff\\'s complaint, he made no other effort to get a ruling on his qualified immunity before trial.\\n\\nCronin\\'s remaining arguments before the district court pertained to two state law claims brought by Dr. Philip. Dr. Philip does not argue on appeal that there was any error in the dismissal of those claims.\\n[2]  Dr. Philip also relies on a supposed inconsistency between Cronin\\'s testimony about why Dr. Philip was fired and the reasons stated in the letter of termination. We see no inconsistency.\\n[3]  We also bypass here defendant\\'s Mt. Healthy defense, raised in his memorandum before the district court. See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.

And, second, if RCW 42.17.680(2) does apply in such situations, does its application violate a newspaper\\'s constitutionally guaranteed free press right to editorial control of the paper\\'s content? The concurrence claims this employee lacks standing, a matter which will also be discussed.\\n*872 We find that RCW 42.17.680(2) does prohibit this employer from discriminating against an employee on the basis of the employee\\'s refusal to remain politically abstinent. However, we conclude the statute cannot constitutionally apply to McClatchy Newspapers or The News Tribune (TNT) under the free press clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\nThe trial court\\'s dismissal of Sandra Nelson\\'s statutory and constitutional causes of action is, therefore, affirmed.\\n\\nI.\\n\\nFACTS\\nSandra Nelson began working as a reporter for TNT in 1983, three years before McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., purchased it. When McClatchy acquired TNT in 1986 it retained Nelson as a reporter. Nelson covered the \"education beat\" and focused on Tacoma schools as well as regional and state educational issues and, by all accounts, did a good job.\\nA fundamental goal of TNT, as a news publication, is to appear objective in the eyes of its readers. As part of this effort, TNT management put forth an ethics code in 1987 regulating activity deemed to present apparent or actual conflicts of interest. The ethics code defines conflicts of interest to include all situations in which readers might be led to believe that the news reporting is biased, including situations in which reporters participate in high profile political activity. Nelson\\'s admitted violation of this code of ethics led to her transfer and the present suit.\\nJournalistic codes of ethics are common. In fact, most newspapers in the country have some form of code of conduct to minimize conflicts of interest. A 1983 study indicates that 75 percent of news organizations have similar codes in place.[2] For example, The Washington Post has a code nearly identical to TNT\\'s stating in part that newsroom employees must \"`avoid active involvement in any partisan causes\\x97politics, community affairs, social action, demonstrations\\x97that could compromise or seem to compromise our ability to report and edit fairly.\\'\" Jason P. Isralowitz, The Reporter as Citizen: Newspaper Ethics and Constitutional Values, 141 U.Pa.L.Rev. 221, 222 n. 7 (1992) (quoting Benjamin C. Bradlee, Standards and Ethics, in the Washington Post Deskbook on Style 1, 3 (Thomas W. Lippman ed., 2d ed. 1989)). Similarly, the Associated Press has a code containing nearly identical provisions including \"Involvement in politics, demonstrations and social causes that could cause a conflict of interest, or the appearance of such conflict should be avoided.\" Clerk\\'s Papers (CP) at 231-32. The code of ethics of the Society of Professional Journalists is also similar.\\nNelson is a self-professed lesbian who spends much of her off-duty hours serving as a political activist. She attends political fora, demonstrations, and classes for political causes including highly visible support for gay and lesbian rights, feminist issues, and abortion rights. Nelson is also a member of and organizer for Tacoma Radical Women, a feminist socialist organization, and the Freedom Socialist Party. Much of her political activism has been supported by this party and has been in support of its party platform. McClatchy knew of Nelson\\'s political activities when it chose to retain her.\\nIn 1987, Nelson was seen by a TNT reporter and photographer as she was picketing for abortion rights outside a local hospital. TNT management told her such activity compromised the paper\\'s appearance of objectivity. Nelson responded she would continue her public political activity anyway.\\nIn 1989, Nelson helped launch a ballot initiative to have an antidiscrimination ordinance reinstated following its repeal. Throughout 1990 she visibly promoted the initiative by organizing volunteers, soliciting support from various groups, arranging for community speakers, organizing rallies, and collecting signatures for the initiative. The initiative battle remained a major political story throughout the year and increasingly *873 so as the fall election approached. On August 15, 1990, TNT\\'s editors informed Nelson that she would be transferred from her position as education reporter to swing shift copy editor until after the November election. TNT stated that Nelson\\'s activities violated the ethics code and raised concern about TNT\\'s appearance of objectivity.\\nA swing shift copy editor is a nonmanagerial position requiring the same general qualifications as a reporter. Nelson maintained her salary, benefits, and seniority and edited a wide variety of local and national stories. However, she was required to work nights and weekends and was no longer a beat reporter investigating and writing stories. Nelson\\'s transfer became permanent when she refused to promise future conformity with the ethics code.\\nNelson remained politically active. For example in 1994 she actively opposed a ballot initiative which would have prevented municipalities from extending civil rights to gays and lesbians. Also in 1994 she testified before the state Legislature on behalf of the \"Stonewall Committee\" in support of a gay and lesbian civil rights bill. The story received front page coverage in TNT and most other state newspapers. TNT was initially alerted by a legislator who knew Nelson as a TNT employee and contacted TNT to ask if Nelson was lobbying the Legislature on TNT\\'s behalf. TNT\\'s editors wrote to Nelson that \"We are dismayed and concerned that you have taken your political activism to a new and larger arena.\" CP at 405. The editors also wrote that such activity jeopardized the credibility of TNT in the eyes of its readers and the Legislature alike. They told Nelson that their discomfort had nothing to do with the content of her politics as, indeed, TNT has on several occasions adopted progay positions in its editorials. TNT concluded by informing Nelson that if her political activism further compromised the paper\\'s credibility, it would be forced to \"further isolate\" her and to \"take appropriate disciplinary action.\" CP at 405.\\nNelson requested TNT to reinstate her as reporter. In October 1993 she wrote to her supervisor requesting her reinstatement and she later applied for a position as reporter. In January 1995 she sent TNT a letter asking to be considered for what she asserted was an unannounced opening as education reporter.[3] Since Nelson\\'s transfer, TNT has hired nine reporters to cover various topics. Nelson alleged that it was made clear that the positions would remain closed to her so long as she continued her high profile political activism. TNT responded that Nelson never applied for any open position; however, for the purpose of this opinion we will assume the truth of Nelson\\'s allegations.\\nAfter unsuccessfully pursuing redress in a federal forum, Nelson filed suit in Pierce County Superior Court alleging TNT improperly stripped her of her position as reporter. Nelson alleged TNT: (a) violated RCW 42.17.680(2) of the Fair Campaign Practices Act, which Nelson claims prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on their support of initiatives, political parties or political committees; (b) violated several provisions of the state constitution including article I, section 5 (free speech), article I, section 4 (freedom to assemble and petition government), article I, section 19 (guarantee of free elections), and article II, section 1 (popular right to initiative); (c) breached her employment contract because she was transferred without good cause; and (d) wrongfully transferred her because it is against public policy to forbid employees from participating in off-duty political activity. The trial court granted summary judgment to TNT on Nelson\\'s claim under RCW 42.17.680 and on all her constitutional claims. The remaining breach of employment and wrongful transfer claims survived and are scheduled for trial on remand. Thus, the issue before this court is the propriety of the trial court\\'s summary judgment dismissal of Nelson\\'s statutory and constitutional claims.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nDOES RCW 42.17.680(2) APPLY?\\nNelson asserts that RCW 42.17.680(2) applies. We agree.\\nRCW 42.17.680(2) states in full:\\n*874 No employer or labor organization may discriminate against an officer or employee in the terms or conditions of employment for (a) the failure to contribute to, (b) the failure in any way to support or oppose, or (c) in any way supporting or opposing a candidate, ballot proposition, political party, or political committee.\\n(Emphasis added.)\\nNelson asserts the statute is clear on its face and applies in her case. A fundamental rule of construction is, absent ambiguity, the plain wording of the statute controls. Anderson v. City of Seattle, 123 Wash.2d 847, 851, 873 P.2d 489 (1994). Thus, the statute prohibits discrimination based on an employee\\'s \"supporting or opposing a candidate, ballot proposition, political party, or political committee.\" RCW 42.17.680(2).\\nThe issue is whether an employee who is discriminated against for refusing to abstain from political involvement fits within the statutory language of someone removed for \"supporting or opposing\" a ballot initiative, political party or committee. There is little outside guidance on the meaning of the provision in question and there is no case law interpreting the statute. The original version of the initiative came out of the state senate as Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5864, and the legislative history of intent is scarce there as well. A staff memo circulated to the senate committee originally overseeing the bill stated that, amongst other things, the bill would prohibit employers from \"discriminat[ing] against employees on the basis of their political activity.\" Senate Comm. Staff Memorandum, Campaign Contributions &amp; Expenditures: Highlights of Proposed Sub. S.B. 5864, at 2 (Mar. 5, 1991). Newspaper articles and editorials[4] published during the 1992 election season uniformly fail to mention this particular provision nor does the voter\\'s pamphlet in its description of or the statements for and against the law. In all, the provision now before the court seems to have gone largely unnoticed.\\nNelson urges that the plain language of the statute supports her position. And, in circumspect, one may also find support for her position in the subsection preceding the one at issue. Subsection (2)(b) states that no employer may discriminate against an employee for the \"failure in any way to support or oppose\" a candidate, ballot proposition, political party, or political committee. RCW 42.17.680(2)(b). Subsection (2)(c), at issue here, states that no employer may discriminate against an employee for \"in any way supporting or opposing a candidate, ballot proposition, political party, or political committee.\" RCW 42.17.680(2)(c). Logically, subsection (2)(b) would apply when the employee fails to adopt and support the employer\\'s political position, whereas subsection (2)(c) would apply when the employee refuses to abstain from political activity. It is difficult to imagine what subsection (2)(c) would mean if not what Nelson claims. Adopting TNT\\'s reading that the statute does not apply when the employer merely requires political abstinence is contrary to the text of subsection (2)(c).[5]\\nTNT, on the other hand, asserts that the provision should be read in context. Nationwide Papers, Inc. v. Northwest Egg *875 Sales, Inc., 69 Wash.2d 72, 76, 416 P.2d 687 (1966) (\"Language within a statute must be read in context with the entire statute and construed in a manner consistent with the general purposes of the statute.\").[6] TNT asserts that when read in context, the provision has a narrower meaning and will apply only when an employer attempts to strong-arm an employee into adopting its political position. The trial court agreed with TNT and held the statute applies only when the employer requires an employee to adopt its political position and does not apply when the employer merely requires political neutrality of its employees.\\nInitiative 134 which contains the provision in question was aimed at repairing the political process through campaign finance reform.[7] The primary change proposed by the initiative was the imposition of contribution limits that individuals and entities could give per candidate per election. The initiative also sought to prohibit contributions from one candidate\\'s campaign to another, forbid public funding of campaigns, limit the repayment of loans taken out while campaigning, and prohibit fundraising by legislators during session. The official ballot title asked:\\nShall campaign contributions be limited; public funding of state and local campaigns be prohibited; and campaign related activities be restricted?\\n1992 Voters Pamphlet, Initiative Measure 134, at 8.\\nOne of the stated purposes of the initiative was to prevent financially strong organizations from exercising a disproportionate or controlling influence on elections. RCW 42.17.610(1). In 1993, the initiative became codified under the heading of Campaign Contribution Limitations under chapter 42.17 RCW, the public disclosure act, the purpose of which is to inform the public of campaign and lobbying contributions and to help ensure, through disclosure, the integrity of government. See Cowles Publishing Co. v. State Patrol, 109 Wash.2d 712, 719, 748 P.2d 597 (1988).\\nTNT argues the statutory provision in question was not intended to apply as Nelson asserts. Washington already has a labor law statute forbidding discrimination against an employee on the basis of age, sex, marital status, race, creed, color, national origin, or physical handicap. RCW 49.60.180. Nelson\\'s reading, TNT argues, in effect creates an additional category, that of political activist, but would locate it in the campaign finance reform law rather than in labor or other civil rights laws.[8] TNT argues if creation of such a broad right was intended, why was it quietly slipped into campaign finance reform?\\nBut TNT\\'s interpretation does not track the text of the act. When read in context this law has a clear relation to the rest of the campaign finance reform act; it is meant to prevent employers from wielding their might to influence politics and elections. The law is part of campaign finance, not civil rights or labor law. Taken as a whole, the provision in question means that employers may not disproportionately influence politics by forcing their employees to support their position or by attempting to force political abstinence on politically active employees. The law is designed to restrict organizations from wielding political influence by manipulating the political influence of their employees through employment decisions. Moreover, TNT\\'s reading essentially renders the provision in question meaningless as RCW 42.17.680(2)(b) already covers the interpretation urged by TNT. Nisqually Delta Ass\\'n v. *876 City of DuPont, 95 Wash.2d 563, 568, 627 P.2d 956 (1981) (whenever possible, courts should avoid a statutory construction which nullifies, voids, or renders meaningless or superfluous any section or words).\\nWe hold RCW 42.17.680(2) applies to the present case and substantial evidence supports its application.\\nWe now turn to the constitutional issue which we find dispositive.\\n\\nIII.\\nDOES RCW 42.17.680(2) UNCONSTITUTIONALLY INFRINGE ON TNT\\'S RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF THE PRESS?\\nWe hold that RCW 42.17.680(2) unconstitutionally infringes on TNT\\'s right to freedom of the press.\\nTNT asserts that RCW 42.17.680(2) as applied to it violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution[9] and article I, section 5, of the state constitution.[10] In particular, TNT asserts that the free press clause of both constitutions guarantees it editorial discretion to control the content of its publication. TNT further asserts that controlling the newspaper\\'s credibility is an integral component of this. TNT argues its conflict of interest policies are designed to control its credibility and are a reflection of its content. TNT concludes that requiring its reporters to abide by its no-conflict-of-interest policy is necessary to uphold its editorial integrity, which TNT asserts is constitutionally protected. Accordingly, TNT claims that RCW 42.17.680(2) does not apply to it in this case. On the contrary, Nelson asserts that what TNT\\'s reporters do on their own time has nothing to do with the content or credibility of the newspaper and accordingly the free press clauses of the federal and state constitutions are irrelevant. While the trial court dismissed Nelson\\'s statutory claim holding the statute inapplicable, it redundantly ruled in TNT\\'s favor on this point as well, reasoning:\\nThe First Amendment and the Washington Constitution protect Defendants\\' editorial discretion. Under the First Amendment and the Washington Constitution, Defendants have a right to protect the newspaper\\'s unbiased content, both its facts and as perceived by its readers, its sources and its advertisers. In order to protect the newspaper\\'s credibility, Defendants may enforce the political neutrality of reporters.\\nCP at 425-29.\\nWe agree with TNT and affirm the trial court on this ground.\\nThe free speech clauses of the federal and state constitutions have always held a revered position in our society. Laurence Tribe, a preeminent constitutional law scholar, has characterized free speech as \"the Constitution\\'s most majestic guarantee.\" Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 12-1, at 785 (2d ed. 1988). Free speech is a fundamental right on its own as well as a keystone right enabling us to preserve all other rights. Id. As one federal judge has noted, \"Free speech is the single most important element upon which this nation has thrived.\" Guzick v. Drebus, 305 F. Supp. 472, 481 (N.D.Ohio 1969), aff\\'d 431 F.2d 594 (6th Cir.1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 948, 91 S. Ct. 941, 28 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1971).\\nThe Supreme Court has observed \"the Founders ... felt that a free press would advance `truth, science, morality, and arts in general\\' as well as responsible government.\" Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 147, 87 S. Ct. 1975, 1987, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1094 (1967) (quoting Letter to the Inhabitants of Quebec, 1 Journals of the Continental Cong. 108 (1774)). From the start we have acknowledged that active protection from governmental abridgment is essential. Upon presenting the Bill of Rights to Congress in 1789 James Madison declared \"the liberty of the press is expressly declared to be beyond the reach of this government. ...\" (quoting Hugo L. Black, A Constitutional Faith 46 (1968) (quoting 1 Annals of Congress 141 *877 (1857) (1789-96))). Madison later explained that we should err on the side of upholding and protecting the freedom of the press:\\nAmong those principles deemed sacred in America, among those sacred rights considered as forming the bulwark of their liberty, which the Government contemplates with awful reverence and would approach only with the most cautious circumspection, there is no one of which the importance is more deeply impressed on the public mind than the liberty of the press. That this liberty is often carried to excess; that it has sometimes degenerated into licentiousness, is seen and lamented, but the remedy has not yet been discovered Perhaps it is an evil inseparable from the good with which it is allied; perhaps it is a shoot which cannot be stripped from the stalk without wounding vitally the plant from which it is torn. However desirable those measures might be which might correct without enslaving the press, they have never yet been devised in America.\\nRosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 403 U.S. 29, 51, 91 S. Ct. 1811, 1823, 29 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1971) (emphasis in original) (quoting 6 Writings of James Madison, 1790-1802, at 336 (G. Hunt ed. 1906)).\\nSince the first days of the republic, our courts have recognized the importance of a free press and have remained vigilant to protect it from government intrusion. Justice Dolliver wrote \"A free press is certainly an essential and crucial ingredient of a democratic society.\" Herron v. KING Broadcasting Co., 109 Wash.2d 514, 527, 746 P.2d 295 (1987) (Dolliver, J., concurring specially). Further, of all the media, the written press has been protected most vehemently. Professor Tribe informs us \"[t]he first amendment guarantee of freedom from government intrusion reigns most confidently in the realm of the print media....\" Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 12-25, at 1003 (2d ed. 1988).\\nWe take note of a national trend to emphasize the First Amendment protection. The United States Supreme Court has recently set the pace in stressing the importance of vigorously protecting free speech within our system.[11] One scholar has acknowledged \"[t]he contemporary Court is moving from the formalism and restrictiveness of the Burger Court retrenchment to a more ... liberal conception of free speech practice.\" Keith Werhan, The Liberalization of Freedom of Speech on a Conservative Court, 80 Iowa L.Rev. 51, 52 (1994). We also recognize that this trend has arrived at the state courts as well.[12] These principles, concerns, *878 and trends are absolutely consistent with our decision today.\\nWhile TNT claims protection from both the federal and state constitutional free press clauses, it fails to conduct a Gunwall analysis[13] or show why the state provision should be interpreted differently. We have repeatedly held that failure to do so will lead us to interpret the state constitutional clause coextensively with its parallel federal counterpart, and we will do so here. See State v. Furman, 122 Wash.2d 440, 448, 858 P.2d 1092 (1993).\\nWhen addressing whether a governmental regulation or action affecting the press is violative of its constitutional free press protection, we begin by noting the two governing polar principles and then consider where the complained action falls. On one extreme is the general principle that a newspaper has \"no special immunity from the application of general laws\" simply because it is the press. Associated Press v. N.L.R.B., 301 U.S. 103, 132, 57 S. Ct. 650, 655-56, 81 L. Ed. 953 (1937). On the opposite side is the principle that the government absolutely may not regulate the content of a newspaper. Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 94 S. Ct. 2831, 41 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1974).\\nMiami Herald Publishing is the seminal case on the issue. In Miami Herald the United States Supreme Court held that the state absolutely may not regulate the content of a newspaper. 418 U.S. at 258, 94 S.Ct. at 2839-40. At issue was the constitutionality of a Florida \"right-of-access\" statute which forced newspapers to publish responses of politicians who had been criticized by the paper. At the heart of Miami Herald is the notion that in order to uphold the circulation of ideas the editors of a newspaper must be free to exercise editorial control and discretion. Id. at 258, 94 S.Ct. at 2839-40. The court held that \"`[l]iberty of the press is in peril as soon as the government tries to compel what is to go into a newspaper.\\'\" Id. at 258 n. 24, 94 S.Ct. at 2840 n. 24 (quoting 2 Zechariah Chafee, Jr., Government and Mass Communications 633 (1947)). The court concluded because the state law deprived the paper of its editorial discretion, it was necessarily unconstitutional as applied to the newspaper.[14]\\nThus, Miami Herald clearly establishes that editorial control is a necessary component of the free press and a state law infringing thereon will be unconstitutional as applied.\\nFollowing Miami Herald was Passaic Daily News v. N.L.R.B., 736 F.2d 1543 (D.C.Cir.1984). Passaic held a newspaper could not be constitutionally required to publish a reporter\\'s column as a remedy for unlawful termination because it would interfere with the paper\\'s editorial function. Id. at 1558. If a newspaper cannot be required to publish a particular reporter\\'s work, how can it be constitutionally required to employ the individual as a reporter? Perhaps the paper could be ordered to employ the reporter for noneditorial services, but that is exactly what TNT is presently doing.\\nEditorial integrity and credibility are core objectives of editorial control and thus merit protection under the free press clauses. This conclusion is illustrated by a well-worded opinion by Chief Justice Burger: \"The power of a privately owned newspaper to advance its own political, social, and economic views is bounded only by two factors: first, the acceptance of a sufficient number of readers\\x97and hence advertisers\\x97to assure financial success; and, second, the journalistic integrity of its editors and publishers.\" Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. Democratic Nat\\'l Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 117, 93 S.Ct. *879 2080, 2094, 36 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1973) (Burger, C.J., plurality op.). Our conclusion is also supported by academic texts showing credibility to be crucial to a paper\\'s ability to operate. For example, a piece chronicling the development of the print media indicates that by 1900 \"[i]mpartial gathering and reporting Of the news were generally recognized to be the basic obligation of newspapers.\" Warren K. Agee et al, Introduction to Mass Communications 57 (7th ed. 1982).\\nIn Newspaper Guild of Greater Philadelphia v. N.L.R.B., 636 F.2d 550, 560 (1980), the circuit court wrote that editorial integrity is to a newspaper what machinery is to a manufacturer. The court stated that \"protection of the editorial integrity of a newspaper lies at the core of publishing control.\" Id. at 560. The court continued: \"At least with respect to most news publications, credibility is central to their ultimate product and to the conduct of the enterprise.\" Id. at 560. Accordingly, the court noted that a newspaper\\'s ability to control its credibility falls within the sphere of First Amendment protection and laws infringing thereon must be scrutinized. Id. at 560.\\nThe Newspaper Guild court continued that\\nIn order to preserve [its managerial prerogative to control its editorial integrity,] a news publication must be free to establish without interference, reasonable rules designed to prevent its employees from engaging in activities which may directly compromise their standing as responsible journalists and that of the publication for which they work as a medium of integrity.\\nId. at 561 (footnotes omitted).\\nThis is directly on point. The no-conflict-of-interest policy employed by TNT was expressly designed for the exact purpose of upholding TNT\\'s credibility. This policy therefore merits protection under the free press clauses of the state and federal constitutions.\\nNelson claims Associated Press v. N.L.R.B., 301 U.S. 103, 57 S. Ct. 650, 81 L. Ed. 953 (1937), supports her position that codes of ethics regulating high profile employee activity do not go to a newspaper\\'s core function and hence are not protected under the free press clauses. There the Associated Press fired one of its editors for attempting to unionize the work force. Id. at 124-25, 57 S.Ct. at 652-53. Firing the editor violated the National Labor Relations Act\\'s specific grant to workers to form, join, and participate in labor unions. Id. at 123, 57 S.Ct. at 651-52. The court, by a five to four vote with a strong dissent by Justice Sutherland, found the NLRA constitutional, id. at 132, 57 S.Ct. at 655-56, but also concluded the true motivation for the firing related to union membership, not editorial prerogative.\\nThe court rested its decision on a finding that unionizing had \"no relation whatever\" to Associated Press\\'s news distributing function. Id. at 133, 57 S.Ct. at 656. Thus, Associated Press must be distinguished from this case. While internally unionizing a small work force may not impinge on a news publication\\'s credibility and integrity vis-\u00e0-vis the outside world, high profile politicized activities of a reporter arguably do. The Associated Press case affirmatively supports this view. In particular, the decision unambiguously noted that it was not commenting on whether Associated Press could discharge the editor if or when his continued activity led Associated Press to believe its appearance of impartiality was subverted. Id. at 132, 57 S.Ct. at 655-56. On the contrary, the Associated Press decision itself noted that Associated Press could still publish the news as it desired and could still create and enforce policies of its own choosing. Id. at 133, 57 S.Ct. at 656. The court also stated that Associated Press would be free to discharge the editor or any editorial employee who fails to comply with the policies it may adopt. Id. at 133, 57 S.Ct. at 656. If a publisher may discharge an employee for failing to comply with its editorial policies, it should be equally entitled to transfer an employee to an equal-paying position which has less public exposure. Associated Press does not hold that freedom of the press may be violated by any general law but only that general law (the NLRA) did not.\\nWe think this language in Associated Press clearly supports this view that TNT\\'s actions were within its constitutionally protected sphere of control of editorial integrity *880 and credibility even though the statute in question is a general law.\\nFurther, the Associated Press case is limited to the NLRA and union activity. We are mindful of the context in which the Associated Press case was decided. Indeed, Associated Press was handed down at the height of President Roosevelt\\'s New Deal and political attacks on the court. Finding the NLRA unconstitutional (which four members of the court were prepared to do) would have represented an unpopular blow to President Roosevelt\\'s attempts to restructure government and society through national legislation such as the NLRA. We should not stretch Associated Press beyond limits carefully crafted as part of the original text to guide its application.\\nNelson also points to Hausch v. Donrey of Nevada, Inc., 833 F. Supp. 822 (1993), to support her assertion that TNT\\'s attempt to protect its editorial integrity and credibility did not fall within the zone of free press protections. In Hausch the United States District Court for Nevada held the press is not immune from suit under the antidiscrimination laws of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 simply because it is the press. Id. at 830. However, the court there noted that the paper had not alleged that its ability to control the integrity and credibility of the paper had been affected by the antidiscrimination laws. Id. at 829. Accordingly Hausch is not on point.\\nHere, TNT implemented a code of ethics which it designed in good faith to foster the newspaper\\'s integrity and credibility. Case law unambiguously allows a news publication to follow a code designed to limit conflicts of interest which may diminish publication credibility. TNT adopted such a code. Freedom of the press leaves such decisions to the press, not the legislature or the courts. The code is facially designed to uphold the appearance of impartiality. Indeed, the code seems representative of those in place at 75 percent of our nation\\'s newspapers.[15] In fact, as stated earlier, it is nearly identical to those employed by the Associated Press, The Washington Post, and the Society of Professional Journalists.\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nJURISDICTION AND STANDING\\nThe concurrences of Chief Justice Durham and Justice Dolliver assert for the first time anywhere, anytime, Nelson\\'s action is statutorily barred for lack of prior notice to the attorney general.[16] However, the meaning and\/or applicability of RCW 42.17.400 is not properly before us. The claim has neither been raised nor briefed by the parties. We are hesitant to decide it; although we posit the concurrence has rushed to decide it wrongly.\\nThis court has never held RCW 42.17.400 applies (much less exclusively) to an action maintained pursuant to RCW 42.17.680, nor has it held section .400 is jurisdictional in any action brought under that chapter, much less every one.\\nBut the chiefs concurrence not only assumes RCW 42.17.400 applies exclusively to every and any action brought to enforce any legal right referenced in the entire chapter RCW 42.17, it also concludes Nelson\\'s possible failure to notify the attorney general necessarily strips the court of \"subject matter jurisdiction.\" Concurrence (Durham, C.J.) at 1. Were this view correct, no court *881 would ever have jurisdiction to decide any private action arising under or pertaining to any provision of the entire chapter absent compliance with section .400. Notwithstanding, there are many examples to the contrary.[17]\\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the \"court\\'s power to hear and determine cases of the general class or category to which proceedings in question belong.\" Black\\'s Law Dictionary 1425 (6th ed. 1990). See also State v. Pritchard, 79 Wash.App. 14, 19-20, 900 P.2d 560 (1995) (subject matter jurisdiction is the authority to hear and determine the class of action to which a case belongs, not the authority to grant the relief requested, or the correctness of the decision), review denied, 128 Wash.2d 1017, 911 P.2d 1342 (1996). The superior court clearly has general jurisdiction pursuant to Const. art. IV \u00a7 6 (amend. 87). Were this not sufficient to hear most everything brought before it, RCW 42.17.400 expressly invokes the same court\\'s jurisdiction to hear cases of the same general class or category as Nelson\\'s.\\nWe have held the section .400 requirement regarding the attorney general notification relates to standing, not jurisdiction. Bare v. Gorton, 84 Wash.2d 380, 382, 526 P.2d 379 (1974) specifically holds RCW 42.17.400 defines standing. (\"[P]rivate citizen has filed demand on the Attorney General to take action against plaintiff for violation of the act and, in addition, gave notice of his intent to bring a citizen\\'s action under RCW 42.17.400(4) if the Attorney General fails to proceed. Plaintiff therefore meets the requirements of standing ....\") (emphasis added). Cf. Donald v. City of Vancouver, 43 Wash.App. 880, 886 n. 3, 719 P.2d 966 (1986) (attorney general notification is a prerequisite to taxpayer standing unless such notification would have been useless).\\nStanding is not jurisdiction. DeWeese v. City of Port Townsend, 39 Wash. App. 369, 372, 693 P.2d 726 (1984) (\"standing is a substantive, not jurisdictional, question\") (citing Hoskins v. City of Kirkland, 7 Wash. App. 957, 961, 503 P.2d 1117 (1972)).[18] Parties may not raise standing challenges for the first time on appeal. State v. Grundy, 25 Wash.App. 411, 416, 607 P.2d 1235 (1980) (\"By not raising the issue below, the State never challenged the Grundys to prove their standing and never gave the trial court an opportunity to rule.\"). This case presents even less reason to address standing than Grundy as Grundy concerned a party who at least argued lack of standing, albeit first on appeal. But here no party has even done that.\\nIt is inadvisable for an appellate court to address an issue not considered below and nowhere briefed or argued, particularly an issue of first impression, as this would be. Herberg v. Swartz, 89 Wash.2d 916, 925, 578 P.2d 17 (1978); see also RAP 12.1(a) (\"[T]he appellate court will decide a case only on the basis of issues set forth by the parties in their briefs.\").\\nOther jurisdictions estop any consideration of standing at this juncture. For example, the Illinois Appeals Court held lack of standing is not jurisdictional, but rather is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded and proven. People ex rel. Vuagniaux v. City of Edwardsville, 284 Ill.App.3d 407, 219 Ill. Dec. 725, 731, 672 N.E.2d 40, 46 (1996) (\"It is the defendant\\'s burden to show that *882 the plaintiffs do not have standing to sue.\"). Similarly, in Washington, affirmative defenses must be pleaded or lost. CR 8(c). But no defect in standing was pleaded here. See Answer of Defendant, CP at 10-17. The Pennsylvania court found it error for the appellate court to rule on standing sua sponte because defendant \"did not raise and\/or preserve that issue\" for appeal. Society Created To Reduce Urban Blight (SCRUB) v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 682 A.2d 1, 3 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1996). See also Statewide Bldg. Maintenance, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Convention Ctr. Auth., 160 Pa. Commw. 544, 635 A.2d 691, 698 n. 13 (1993) (holding that, even though plaintiff probably lacked standing to sue, the appellate court could not raise the issue sua sponte because it was not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction and defendants failed to raise standing in their preliminary objections).\\nHowever, it is unnecessary to consider Nelson\\'s standing because (1) the meaning or applicability of RCW 42.17.400 is not properly before us as it was neither raised nor briefed by the parties; and (2) we affirm the dismissal on independent and dispositive grounds.\\n\\nV.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nWe recognize Nelson\\'s statutory right to avoid workplace discrimination based on her politics. Since this right is established by the statute we need not consider whether it is also established by the state constitution. However, the First Amendment freedom of the press is the constitutional minimum regardless of the legal source of government abridgment. Choosing an editorial staff is a core press function, at least when that choice is based on editorial considerations. That is the case here. This statute has been unconstitutionally applied. The trial court\\'s summary judgment dismissal of statutory claims is affirmed and McClatchy shall recover its costs on appeal. The case is remanded for further appropriate proceedings.\\nDURHAM, Chief Justice, concurring.\\nI agree with Justice Dolliver that a private cause of action is not cognizable under RCW 42.17.680, and that the trial court\\'s dismissal of Ms. Nelson\\'s statutory claims, therefore, should be affirmed. I write separately to emphasize that because the Legislature has explicitly provided that alleged violations of RCW 42.17 may be enforced only by or on behalf of the State, we lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider Ms. Nelson\\'s statutory claims. Therefore, it is inappropriate to discuss the merits of these claims.\\nThe unavailability of a private right of action under a statute creates a jurisdictional defect which divests the courts of authority to reach the merits of the case. In Interstate Prod. Credit Ass\\'n v. MacHugh, 61 Wash. App. 403, 810 P.2d 535 (1991), the Court of Appeals upheld a trial court\\'s dismissal of the appellants\\' claims on the basis that the statute under which the appellants brought their claims did not create a private right of action. The court held that the claims were properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. MacHugh, 61 Wash.App. at 408, 810 P.2d 535. We have reiterated this principle as recently as last year in an opinion by Justice Talmadge: \"`In order to acquire complete jurisdiction, so as to be authorized to hear and determine a cause or proceeding, the court necessarily must have jurisdiction of the parties thereto and of the subject matter involved.\\'\" State v. Werner, 129 Wash.2d 485, 493, 918 P.2d 916 (1996) (quoting State ex rel. New York Cas. Co. v. Superior Court, 31 Wash.2d 834, 839, 199 P.2d 581 (1948)).\\nThis principle is uniformly applied in other jurisdictions. See, e.g., State ex rel. Good-year Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Tracey, 66 Ohio App. 3d 71, 583 N.E.2d 426, 427 (per curiam) (holding court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear statutory claims where no private right of action), appeal dismissed per stipulation, 53 Ohio St. 3d 712, 560 N.E.2d 780 (1990); Keizor v. Sand Springs Ry. Co., 861 P.2d 326 (Okla.Ct.App.1993) (holding court should have dismissed action for lack of jurisdiction where no private right of action); Patterson v. Globe Am. Cas. Co., 101 N.M. 541, 685 P.2d 396, 397 (Ct.App.1984) (affirming trial court\\'s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where no private cause of action).\\n*883 The majority argues that we must ignore this jurisdictional defect because the issue was not raised by the parties. However, RAP 2.5(a) unambiguously provides: \"A party or the court may raise at any time the question of appellate court jurisdiction.\" \"A reviewing court always has the power to examine basic questions to determine whether it has jurisdiction to review and resolve the fundamental issues involved.\" State ex rel. Hood v. Washington State Personnel Bd., 82 Wash.2d 396, 402, 511 P.2d 52 (1973).\\nWe not only have the power to determine sua sponte whether we have jurisdiction, but further we have the duty to do so when the issue is not raised by the parties.\\nA court is bound to take notice of the limits of its authority, and it is its right and duty to make a preliminary examination of its jurisdiction to entertain the cause, of its own motion, even though the question is not raised by the pleadings or is not suggested by counsel. If the court finds at any stage of the proceedings that it is without jurisdiction, it is its duty to take proper notice of the defect by staying the proceedings, dismissing, or other appropriate action.\\n21 C.J.S. Courts \u00a7 89 (1990) (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).\\nThis case presents important questions regarding RCW 42.17.680\\'s scope in relation to free press concerns. Yet, \"[t]he rule is well established that in statutory proceedings the jurisdiction and authority of the courts are prescribed by the applicable legislative enactments.\" Passmore v. Passmore, 57 Wash.2d 762, 765, 359 P.2d 811 (1961) (citing Arneson v. Arneson, 38 Wash.2d 99, 227 P.2d 1016 (1951)). Therefore, unless and until these questions are presented pursuant to the explicit enforcement provisions of RCW 42.17.400, we are without jurisdiction to consider them. \"Jurisdiction over the subject matter of an action is an elementary prerequisite to the exercise of judicial power.... A court lacking such jurisdiction may do nothing other than enter an order of dismissal.\" In re Adoption of Buehl, 87 Wash.2d 649, 655, 555 P.2d 1334 (1976) (citing Deschenes v. King County, 83 Wash.2d 714, 716, 521 P.2d 1181 (1974)). Consequently, any discussion of the merits of Ms. Nelson\\'s claims is inappropriate.\\nTALMADGE, J., concurs.\\nDOLLIVER, Justice, concurring.\\nI concur in the result only. Ms. Nelson is barred by RCW 42.17.400 from suing on her own behalf for alleged violations of the Fair Campaign Practices Act, and therefore this suit is barred. If it were not for this procedural barrier, however, I would hold the statute to be applicable to this case and constitutional as applied to the press here.\\nThe enforcement provisions of the Fair Campaign Practices Act bar private actions for damages. RCW 42.17.400. A private citizen may sue to enforce the statute, but only \"in the name of the state,\" and only after (1) written notification to the attorney general and the prosecuting attorney; (2) the failure of the attorney general or prosecuting attorney to act within 45 days; (3) additional notification to the attorney general and prosecuting attorney that the citizen intends to sue; and (4) further inaction by the attorney general or prosecuting attorney within 10 days of receipt of the citizen\\'s second notice. RCW 42.17.400(4) (emphasis added). Moreover, the enforcement provisions explicitly bar private litigants from collecting damages for violations of this statute. Any judgment awarded escheats to the state, less costs and attorney fees. RCW 42.17.400(4).\\nAssuming, however, that the statute provided Ms. Nelson a remedy, I must note that I disagree with the majority\\'s holding that the statute would be unconstitutional as applied to the press here. The First Amendment does not give a newspaper immunity from general laws absent a showing of interference with the newspaper\\'s right to determine what to print.\\nThe majority asserts that this case illustrates a conflict between two \"polar principles\" in First Amendment jurisprudence. Majority at 878. The majority acknowledges, on the one hand, \"that a newspaper has `no special immunity from the application of general laws\\' simply because it is the press.\" Majority at 878 (quoting Associated Press v. N.L.R.B., 301 U.S. 103, 132, 57 S.Ct. *884 650, 656, 81 L. Ed. 953 (1937)). On the other hand, the majority reasons, the government may not regulate the content of a newspaper. Majority at 878-879 (citing Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 258, 94 S. Ct. 2831, 2839-40, 41 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1974)). I see no conflict between these principles in this case because there has been no showing that the government would be regulating content by enforcing this statute. No one has alleged that Ms. Nelson\\'s reporting was influenced in any way by her political views. Nor has anyone alleged that application of the statute would impinge upon the newspaper\\'s exclusive right to determine what to print.\\nThe First Amendment prohibits the government from regulating what a newspaper prints. Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258, 94 S.Ct. at 2839-40. The majority cites this principle to support its holding that the First Amendment also prohibits government regulation of a newspaper\\'s employment decisions. However, there is a distinction between regulation of content and regulation of employment decisions, as is illustrated in Passaic Daily News v. N.L.R.B., 736 F.2d 1543 (D.C.Cir.1984).\\nIn Passaic Daily News, the District of Columbia Circuit held that the defendant newspaper had improperly demoted a columnist due to his outside labor union activities. Passaic Daily News, 736 F.2d at 1555-56. The court stated that the First Amendment did not insulate the press from application of a federal statute prohibiting employers from discharging employees for labor union activity. Yet, at the same time, the court held that the newspaper could not be forced to print the reporter\\'s weekly editorial column as a remedy for the illegal demotion. Passaic Daily News, 736 F.2d at 1558. Passaic Daily News makes it clear that there is a distinction under the First Amendment between government regulation of the press\\'s labor practices and government regulation of editorial control. Whereas the former is allowed, the latter is prohibited by the First Amendment.\\nReferring to Passaic Daily News, the majority states, \"[i]f a newspaper cannot be required to publish a particular reporter\\'s work, how can it be constitutionally required to employ the individual as a reporter?\" Majority at 878. Yet, this was precisely what happened in Passaic Daily News: The newspaper was not required to publish the reporter\\'s weekly editorial column, but it was also prohibited from demoting him due to his activities. The reporter was still allowed to report on local stories; he was just not allowed to write a controversial editorial column. For the court to have ordered the newspaper to continue to publish the column would have been to completely usurp its editorial control. In contrast, the reporter here writes only unbiased stories. There has been no showing that the newspaper\\'s editorial control would be threatened by her continued employment as a reporter.\\nThe majority relies upon Newspaper Guild of Greater Philadelphia v. N.L.R.B., 636 F.2d 550, 560-61 (1980) to buttress its holding that the First Amendment gives the newspaper the right to adopt internal policies protecting its credibility. Majority at 878-879. Although Newspaper Guild addressed the type of policy at issue here, it did so as a means to concluding that a labor union does not have the right to bargain on all aspects of a newspaper\\'s ethics code. The court was not deciding whether an individual employee\\'s statutory and constitutional rights to political expression were trumped by a newspaper\\'s First Amendment right to enforce its ethics code. The case thus provides limited precedential value.\\nIn contrast, the Supreme Court considered whether an individual employee\\'s statutory rights were trumped by a newspaper\\'s First Amendment rights in Associated Press v. N.L.R.B, 301 U.S. 103, 132, 57 S. Ct. 650, 655-56, 81 L. Ed. 953 (1937). There the Court held that the newspaper could not claim First Amendment immunity from provisions of the National Labor Relations Act protecting an employee\\'s right to organize. Associated Press, 301 U.S. at 132, 57 S.Ct. at 655-56. The Court noted that there had been no allegation that the reporter\\'s work was biased, and held that the discharge had been on behalf of the reporter\\'s outside union activity, which was specifically protected by federal law. Associated Press, 301 U.S. at *885 131-32, 57 S.Ct. at 655-56. Just as those statutory provisions protect outside labor activity, the provisions of the Fair Campaign Practices Act protect outside political activity. Absent a showing of bias in Ms. Nelson\\'s work, and a consequent interference with The News Tribune\\'s right to editorial control from the application of the statute, the newspaper cannot claim First Amendment immunity here.\\nSMITH, GUY, MADSEN and ALEXANDER, JJ., concur.\\nNOTES\\n[*]  Editor\\'s Note: Orders amending the opinion and denying reconsideration were issued May 9, 1997.

Once the present lawsuit was filed and the trial court issued its summary judgment ruling the statute came to the Legislature\\'s attention. The senate passed a bill in 1995 (which was vetoed) which would have repealed the provision in question. CP at 375 (Engrossed Second Substitute S. Bill 5576, 54th Leg., Reg. Sess., \u00a7 5 (1995)). Senate staffers interpreted RCW 42.17.680(2)(c), the provision now in question, to prohibit \"employers or labor organizations from demanding the appearance of political neutrality from their employees.\" See CP at 393-95 (Senate Bill Rep. E2SSB 5576). Nelson suggests this indicates that her reading is the correct one. She states that the Legislature failed to repeal the prohibition on an employer demanding political neutrality, and now the court cannot repeal the same by construing it to not exist. The fact that a legislator or a staffer interpreted a statute to create rights and obligations several years after its popular passage should not be viewed as a reflection of legislative intent.

For the same result applicable to a state\\'s ability to restrict political activity of state employees, see Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L.

The complaint, which names nine defendants, alleges that (1) in February 1978, defendant Davis, an officer with the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, seized appellant\\'s automobile and, instead of depositing it in a police yard for impounded property, converted it to his personal use;  (2) in May 1978, defendant Davis assaulted appellant without cause and broke his elbow;  and (3) on June 14, 1979, defendant Davis, together with defendant Pyles, who was also a District of Columbia police officer, planted a gun on appellant, which resulted in his false arrest and imprisonment, and assaulted and threatened to kill him.  The complaint does not allege facts suggesting misconduct by the other named defendants.  Based on these three incidents, the complaint alleges both common-law and constitutional torts, the latter allegedly arising directly under the Constitution as Bivens-type actions, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).  The causes of action here accrued before 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 (1976) became applicable to the District of Columbia.   See District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U.S. 418, 93 S.Ct. 602, 34 L.Ed.2d 613 (1973).\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      In response to the complaint, appellee District of Columbia moved for dismissal or summary judgment.1   The district court dismissed all claims in the case.  The court held that the common-law claims were barred by appellant\\'s failure to comply with D.C.Code Sec. 12-309 (1981), which requires written notice to the District of personal-injury or property-damage claims within six months of the injury or damage.  The court dismissed the constitutional-tort claims on the ground that they were barred by the applicable one-year District of Columbia statute of limitations, D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(4) (1981).  This court subsequently affirmed the decision \"as to all claims except those based on constitutional torts.\"    Record at 14.  In this appeal, the principal, though not the only, issue is whether the district court correctly dismissed the constitutional-tort claims by applying the one-year statute of limitations.  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\\n    \\n    DISCUSSION\\n    \\n      3\\n      To clarify what issues are presented for decision and what issues remain on remand, it is necessary to discuss who the parties are, a subject that is somewhat confused at this stage.  The district court observed that only three of the nine named defendants were served with process, and the court treated the three served defendants as out of the case.  It substituted the District of Columbia for two of them (Mayor Barry and Police Chief Jefferson) and remarked that \"plaintiff makes no allegations of misconduct by\" the third (Officer Gallup).  Record at 8 n. 4.  The court\\'s reliance, in dismissing the common-law tort claims, on D.C.Code Sec. 12-309, which applies only to the District, presupposes that only the District, and none of the named defendants, remained as a party.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      At the time we affirmed the decision below on the common-law claims, we were not presented with a serious question about the district court\\'s treatment of the parties.  That ruling should be understood as having been made on the assumption that only the District of Columbia was a defendant.  We simply did not consider whether other defendants properly remained in the case.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Addressing the issue for the first time, we agree with appellant that the validity of service is not now before us.  Brief of Appellant at 2 n. 1.  Invalid service is a ground for dismissal, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(5);  Peterson v. Sheran, 635 F.2d 1335, 1337 (8th Cir.1980), but the record is unclear on the validity of the service in this case.  On remand, the district court should address the issue.  If the district court concludes that service was valid, it must consider both the constitutional and the common-law claims that remain, but D.C.Code Sec. 12-309, which applies only to the District of Columbia, is no ground for dismissal against any other defendant.  For purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that failure of service has not removed defendants Davis, Pyles, Wright, Andres, Everett, and Jacobs from the case.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Appellees argue that the cases against Mayor Barry, Police Chief Jefferson, and Officer Gallup were properly dismissed because the complaint alleges no misconduct on the part of these defendants, who, they correctly observe, as co-employees of Officers Davis and Pyles, cannot be liable on a theory of respondeat superior.   Tarpley v. Greene, 684 F.2d 1 (D.C.Cir.1982).  Indeed, appellees contend that the same argument warrants dismissal of the cases against all of the defendants except Officers Davis and Pyles.  Appellees are correct in stating that the complaint alleges no wrongdoing whatever on the part of anyone but Officers Davis and Pyles and thus fails to state a cause of action against any other defendant.  The complaint fails to meet the fundamental requirement of notice pleading, to put each defendant on notice of the alleged wrong for which the plaintiff seeks relief.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 8;  5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 1202, at 59-66 (1969).  This failure, however, does not justify dismissal at this juncture.  Plaintiff filed his complaint pro se;  he should be given an opportunity to make his general allegations more specific by pointing to some actionable misconduct on the part of defendants other than Officers Davis and Pyles, if there was any, in the incidents described in the complaint.  If no defendant would be prejudiced thereby, the district court should allow the filing of the more specific, amended complaint.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 15;  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962);  Wyant v. Crittenden, 113 F.2d 170, 175 (D.C.Cir.1940);  Gutierrez v. Vergari, 499 F.Supp. 1040 (S.D.N.Y.1980).\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      The case against the District of Columbia, however, should be dismissed because of appellant\\'s failure to comply with D.C.Code Sec. 12-309.  That section provides:\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      An action may not be maintained against the District of Columbia for unliquidated damages to person or property unless, within six months after the injury or damage was sustained, the claimant, his agent, or attorney has given notice in writing to the Commissioner [Mayor] of the District of Columbia of the approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances of the injury or damage.  A report in writing by the Metropolitan Police Department, in regular course of duty, is a sufficient notice under this section.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      The district court held that this section barred appellant\\'s common-law claims against the District, no adequate notice having been given to the Mayor.  This court affirmed that holding.  As appellant gave no notice of his constitutional claims to the District, those claims against the District are barred if this notice provision applies to Bivens-type suits.  For the reasons set out below, we hold that it does.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      This court has previously stated, even if it has not squarely held, that the provision applies to a constitutional cause of action.  In Marshall v. District of Columbia Government, 559 F.2d 726 (D.C.Cir.1977), the court remanded the case for the district court to consider whether the jurisdictional amount requirement of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(a) (1976) applied to bar the plaintiff\\'s claim that discrimination against him on the basis of his status as an adjudicated bankrupt violated the Constitution.  The court pointed out that, even if the claim were not barred by the jurisdictional amount requirement, the claim might nonetheless be barred because \"[s]uits against the District of Columbia are subject to a six-month notice requirement.  D.C.Code Sec. 12-309 (1973).\"    559 F.2d at 730.  Thus, this court has already rejected the holding in Lively v. Cullinane, 451 F.Supp. 999, 1000 (D.D.C.1976)--the one case relied on by appellant--that D.C.Code Sec. 12-309 applies only to common-law and not to constitutional claims.  In Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 216 (D.C.Cir.1977), cert. denied, 438 U.S. 916, 98 S.Ct. 3146, 57 L.Ed.2d 1161 (1978), moreover, this court devoted three pages to discussing whether, in a Bivens-type class action, a single notice by the class counsel sufficed to discharge the \"statutory notice requirements of 12 D.C.Code Sec. 309\" for all the class members.  Id. at 228-30.  That entire discussion was pointless unless the local law applies to constitutional-tort claims, and the court nowhere suggested that applicability of the provision was merely assumed for purposes of the case.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Although those cases effectively foreclose the issue, we think it worth mentioning several considerations that independently support the view that section 12-309 applies to constitutional claims.  First, the language of the provision is unquestionably broad;  it cannot be read to contain even a hint that it applies only to common-law claims.  In addition, constitutional claims clearly come within the purposes of the provision, which are, \"primarily, to provide the District an opportunity to investigate claims while the circumstances giving rise to them are fresh and, secondarily, to provide an opportunity for settlement.\"   Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d at 230.  The provision\\'s functions of \"protect[ing] the District of Columbia against unreasonable claims\" and of \"encourag[ing] the prompt settlement of meritorious claims,\" Pitts v. District of Columbia, 391 A.2d 803, 807 (D.C.1978), would be significantly undercut by the exclusion from its coverage of all federal or even all constitutional claims for damages.  We infer that the D.C.Code provision was an intentional limitation on the right to bring even federal causes of action for damages against the District of Columbia.  That inference is further supported by Congress\\'s express provision of similar notice requirements in various federal civil rights laws.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(e) (1976) (requiring notice to EEOC of employment discrimination claim within 180 days of accrual of claim, or within 300 days in certain cases);  29 U.S.C. Sec. 626(d)(1) (1976) (requiring notice to Secretary of Labor of age discrimination claim within 180 days of accrual of claim).\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      On the decisive issue of congressional intent, therefore, the D.C. notice provision is unlike the police-recordkeeping provision at issue in Sullivan v. Murphy, 478 F.2d 938 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 880, 94 S.Ct. 162, 38 L.Ed.2d 125 (1973).  The court there accurately characterized the recordkeeping law as a \"local housekeeping\" provision enacted \"as part of a general revision of police recordkeeping procedures\" and not intended \"to limit the remedial jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"    Id. at 972.  The D.C. law at issue in Sullivan, moreover, would have foreclosed the most effective forward-looking remedy for unconstitutional arrests, namely, expungement of records. In contrast, the notice provision here neither removes a traditional equitable remedy nor presents substantial obstacles to the prosecution of a constitutional-tort claim;  it merely establishes a requirement that any conscientious prospective plaintiff can readily meet and that has many analogues in federal civil rights laws.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Application of D.C. Code Sec. 12-309 to constitutional claims is also supported by the rationale of the rule, discussed more fully below, requiring application of local statutes of limitations to claims based on federal laws that specify no limitations period.  That rule rests on deference to the local balancing of interests embodied in statutes of limitations--a balancing of the interest in allowing the prosecution of valid claims against the interest in preventing the prosecution of claims that, because of delay, cannot be fairly litigated.   See Board of Regents v. Tomanio, 446 U.S. 478, 487, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 1796, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980);  Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 464, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1722, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975).  The same balancing of interests lies behind the D.C.Code notice provision.  For all these reasons, we hold that the D.C.Code notice provision bars appellant from pursuing his claims against the District.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      The statute-of-limitations issue presented in this case does not arise with respect to all of the claims in appellant\\'s complaint.  First, as both parties agree, the seizure and conversion claim accruing in February 1978, in both its constitutional and common-law forms, is not subject to the one-year limitation period of D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(4).  Rather, the applicable statute of limitations is three years.  The common-law version clearly falls under the three-year rule of D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(2), which covers actions \"for the recovery of personal property or damages for its unlawful detention.\"    The constitutional claim falls either under that rule or under the three-year rule of D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(8), which covers actions \"for which a limitation is not otherwise specially prescribed.\"    Plaintiff having filed his complaint on September 4, 1980, his seizure and conversion claim is timely.2\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      For different reasons, the statute-of-limitations issue is not presented either by the false-arrest component or by the assault component of the claim arising out of appellant\\'s arrest on June 14, 1979.  As to the false-arrest claim, both the common-law and constitutional versions are barred.  A common-law false arrest claim is defeated by a subsequent conviction on the charges on which the claimant was arrested.   See Menard v. Mitchell, 430 F.2d 486, 491 n. 26 (D.C.Cir.1970);  1 F. Harper &amp; F. James, The Law of Torts Sec. 4.12, at 345 (1956).  Appellant\\'s conviction here on the charges on which he was arrested on June 14, 1979, see Appendix to Brief for Appellee, bars his common-law false arrest claim.  The constitutional version of that claim, which appellant concedes is merely a common-law false arrest claim in constitutional dress, we conclude must likewise be dismissed.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      First, this court has stressed the near identity of the \"common law and constitutional variants\" of \"[t]he tort action of false arrest\" brought against police officers.   Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 167, 175 (D.C.Cir.1977), cert. denied, 438 U.S. 916, 98 S.Ct. 3146, 57 L.Ed.2d 1161 (1978).  The court noted in Dellums that both the interests protected and the \"focal point[s]\" of the two actions--whether the arresting officer was justified in ordering the arrest--are the same.  Id.  Indeed, that case held that the mechanics of pleading and proof in a Bivens-type action are identical to those in the parallel common-law action, and the opinion analyzed the elements of the claims as if they were identical.  Id. at 175-76.  It follows from Dellums that, if subsequent conviction establishes as a matter of law that the arrest was justified for common-law purposes, it should likewise establish that the arrest was justified for constitutional purposes.   See Martin v. Delcambre, 578 F.2d 1164, 1165 (5th Cir.1978);  Shank v. Spruill, 406 F.2d 756, 757 (5th Cir.1969).3\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      The reasons for dismissing the constitutional false-arrest claim do not apply to the assault component of the claim arising from the arrest on June 14, 1979.  Nor does that component, in either its constitutional or common-law form, present any statute-of-limitations problem.  Appellees correctly concede that, whatever statute of limitations applies to this 1979 assault claim, its running was tolled by appellant\\'s imprisonment, which commenced at the time the cause of action accrued and continued at least until appellant filed his complaint.  See D.C.Code Sec. 12-302 (1981).  There is thus no statute-of-limitations bar to appellant\\'s pursuing his claim that the arresting officers unlawfully assaulted and threatened to kill him.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      The only statute-of-limitations question in this case is which limitations period applies to the constitutional form of the May 1978 assault claim, which we will refer to simply as the assault claim.  (The common-law form is clearly barred by D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(4).)    Both parties agree that because no statute of limitations for this Bivens-type action has been expressly provided by Congress, the proper statute to apply is \"the most appropriate one provided by [D.C.] law.\"   Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 462, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1721, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975).4   Appellees contend that the applicable statute is D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(4), which specifies a one-year period for actions \"for libel, slander, assault, battery, mayhem, wounding, malicious prosecution, false arrest or false imprisonment.\"    Appellant contends that the constitutional basis of his claim makes application of that section inappropriate and that the only appropriate statute is D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(8), which specifies a three-year period for actions \"for which a limitation is not otherwise specially prescribed.\"    Our analysis of the Supreme Court\\'s pronouncements on this subject lead us to conclude that the applicable statute of limitations in this case is section 12-301(4).  Because appellant filed his complaint more than one year after his assault cause of action accrued, he may not pursue that claim.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      This court has never squarely faced the question of what local statute of limitations applies to a Bivens-type action for assault. In Eikenberry v. Callahan, 653 F.2d 632, 635 &amp; n. 11 (D.C.Cir.1981), the court referred to \"the three-year period applicable to Bivens actions brought in the District of Columbia,\" citing D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(8).  The statute of limitations issue was not presented in the case, however, and the statement was made in passing, unsupported by any discussion.  In any event, the action sought damages not for assault but for a violation of the First Amendment that bears no resemblance to any of the common-law torts listed in D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(4).  Thus, section 12-301(8) provided the proper limitations period in that case.  Similarly, in Fitzgerald v. Seamans, 553 F.2d 220 (D.C.Cir.1977), the court agreed with the parties to the case that section 12-301(8) applied, but the action was primarily for unlawful conspiracy to deprive plaintiff of his job, an allegation not covered by section 12-301(4) or by any other D.C.Code provision but section 12-301(8).  In any event, the action was found time-barred even under the three-year rule.  In Macklin v. Spector Freight Systems, 478 F.2d 979, 994 (D.C.Cir.1973), decided before Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, the court applied section 12-301(8) to a federal civil rights claim, but the claim there, brought under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 (1976), was for racial discrimination, clearly not analogous to the torts listed in section 12-301(4).5   In none of these cases did the court undertake any analysis of the statute-of-limitations problem either for constitutional actions generally or for assault claims in particular.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      Appellant advances several arguments in support of his contention that the limitations period for the local assault law is inapplicable to the constitutional assault action.  All of the arguments apply not only to assault claims but to all Constitution-based claims with common-law analogues.  Thus, appellant argues that the two forms of claim protect different interests, noting that in Bivens, 403 U.S. at 394, 91 S.Ct. at 2003, the Supreme Court stated that \"[t]he interests protected by state laws regulating trespass and the invasion of privacy, and those protected by the Fourth Amendment\\'s guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures, may be inconsistent or even hostile.\"    Appellant also argues that the elements and sources of the two kinds of causes of action are different, in that the constitutional claim requires proof of the denial (1) under color of local law (2) of a constitutional right, two elements irrelevant to the common-law assault cause of action.  Appellant further argues that, as Justice Harlan once stated in a different context, \"a deprivation of a constitutional right is significantly different from and more serious than a violation of a state right and therefore deserves a different remedy even though the same act may constitute both a state tort and the deprivation of a constitutional right.\"   Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 196, 81 S.Ct. 473, 488, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961) (Harlan, J., concurring).  Finally, appellant argues that application of the local one-year limitations period would undermine the principal goals of Bivens-type actions--to provide compensation for and to deter the violation of constitutional rights.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      Appellant\\'s arguments have been relied on in various degrees in several circuit court cases holding inapplicable to Constitution-based claims state statutes that, like D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(4), specify limitations periods for particular analogous common-law torts.   E.g., Regan v. Sullivan, 557 F.2d 300 (2d Cir.1977);  Beard v. Robinson, 563 F.2d 331 (7th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 438 U.S. 907, 98 S.Ct. 3125, 57 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1978);  Marshall v. Kleppe, 637 F.2d 1217 (9th Cir.1980) (adopting much of the analysis of De Malherbe v. International Union of Elevator Constructors, 449 F.Supp. 1335 (N.D.Cal.1978)).  In contrast, those arguments have been rejected, either explicitly or implicitly, in other circuit court cases holding such statutes of limitations applicable to Constitution-based claims.   E.g., Walden, III, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 576 F.2d 945 (1st Cir.1978);  Carmicle v. Weddle, 555 F.2d 554 (6th Cir.1977);  Polite v. Diehl, 507 F.2d 119 (3d Cir.1974) (en banc).  We are not persuaded by appellant\\'s arguments and agree with the latter line of cases.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      At the outset it is important to note that we need not reject appellant\\'s contentions that constitutional claims differ from closely analogous common-law claims in the interests they protect, in their elements and origins, and in their importance.  For some claims, and in some respects, those contentions are undoubtedly true.6   Appellant has failed, however, to establish that they entail rejection of the local limitations period for the common-law cause of action.  Indeed, the governing Supreme Court decisions strongly suggest that the differences are not decisive ones for statute-of-limitations purposes.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      In Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, the Supreme Court established the general principle that where \"there is no specifically stated or otherwise relevant federal statute of limitations for a cause of action ..., the controlling period would ordinarily be the most appropriate one provided by state law.\"    421 U.S. at 462, 95 S.Ct. at 1721.  The Court explained the policy of deference to state policy judgments that lies behind the principle:\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      Although any statute of limitations is necessarily arbitrary, the length of the period allowed for instituting suit inevitably reflects a value judgment concerning the point at which the interests in favor of protecting valid claims are outweighed by the interests in prohibiting the prosecution of stale ones....  In borrowing a state period of limitation for application to a federal cause of action, a federal court is relying on the State\\'s wisdom in setting a limit ... on the prosecution of a closely analogous claim.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      Id. at 463-64, 95 S.Ct. at 1721-1722.  Noting that an exception to the rule requiring application of the state statute exists where its \"application would be inconsistent with the federal policy underlying the cause of action,\" id. at 465, 95 S.Ct. at 1722, the Court held that the exception did not demand tolling of the statute of limitations in an action brought under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 (1976) while the plaintiff pursued the administrative remedies required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5 (1976).  The section 1981 action was therefore barred by the one-year limitations period assumed to be applicable in the case.  421 U.S. at 462 n. 7, 95 S.Ct. at 1721 n. 7.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Johnson requires a court deciding what state statute of limitations, if any, applies to a federal cause of action to choose the statute applicable to the most \"closely analogous claim\" unless applying that statute would be inconsistent with relevant federal policies.  We believe that, contrary to appellant\\'s contention, the Supreme Court did not intend the constitutional character of a cause of action by itself to be a ground for rejecting as not closely analogous an otherwise identical common-law cause of action.  First, the Court made a point of noting that there is nothing \"peculiar to a federal civil rights action that would justify special reluctance in applying state law.\"    Id. at 464, 95 S.Ct. at 1722.  Second, and more important, appellant\\'s interpretation of the Johnson rule conflicts with the Supreme Court\\'s formula for choosing a state limitations period.  If the federal, or constitutional, character of a claim meant that some state limitations periods were too short, the Court would, presumably, have said so, and would not have directed that the period chosen be that applicable to a \"closely analogous claim.\"This reading of Johnson is reinforced by the Supreme Court\\'s decision in Board of Regents v. Tomanio, 446 U.S. 478, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980), to adopt state tolling provisions along with state limitations periods, a decision that underscores the policy of deference to state judgments behind the Johnson rule.  The Tomanio Court explained the state judgment typically embodied in statutes of limitations as follows:\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      Statutes of limitations are not simply technicalities.  On the contrary, they have long been respected as fundamental to a well-ordered judicial system.  Making out the substantive elements of a claim for relief involves a process of pleading, discovery, and trial.  The process of discovery and trial which result in the finding of ultimate facts for or against the plaintiff by the judge or jury is obviously more reliable if the witness or testimony in question is relatively fresh.  Thus in the judgment of most legislatures and courts, there comes a point at which the delay of a plaintiff in asserting a claim is sufficiently likely either to impair the accuracy of the fact-finding process or to upset settled expectations that a substantive claim will be barred without respect to whether it is meritorious.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      Id. at 487, 100 S.Ct. at 1796.  As this passage makes clear, the state judgment behind the establishment of limitations periods typically concerns two subjects:  factfinding accuracy and settled expectations.  Given a federal cause of action for which no limitations period is specified by federal law, some limitations period is required in order to avoid litigation that impairs accuracy or defeats expectations.    Johnson and Tomanio direct that the trial court adopt the state statute of limitations for the most closely analogous claim because, when federal law has not spoken, the state statute is the only law available that reflects the appropriate judgment about factfinding accuracy and settled expectations.  It follows that, in determining what claim (among those for which a state limitations period is specified) is most closely analogous to a given federal claim, a court should select the claim most closely comparable to the federal claim with respect to factfinding accuracy and settled expectations.  The comparison of any two claims will generally focus on the facts that must be litigated in trying them.7\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      We need not, and we cannot, say in advance how any given federal cause of action compares in the relevant respect with any given category of claims for which District of Columbia law specifies a limitations period.  The proper mode of comparison is clear, however, and so too are several of its consequences.  First, two claims need not be identical to be analogous for statute-of-limitations purposes, and even some significant differences will not warrant rejection of a specified period and adoption of the residual provision.   See, e.g., Forrestal Village, Inc. v. Graham, 551 F.2d 411, 414 (D.C.Cir.1977) (even if local blue sky law requires no proof of scienter, its limitations period applies to action under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires such proof:  \"this possible difference between the federal statute and the local statute is easily outweighed by their similarities in both purpose and substance\").  Second, some claims, such as discrimination claims, are clearly not analogous to any of the causes of action listed in D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(4).  This court\\'s opinions applying the residual provision to certain Constitution-based actions, see pp. 371-372 supra, are thus fully consistent with, indeed are explained by, our interpretation of the Johnson rule.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      Most important, it is evident how to apply the proper mode of comparison in at least one important class of cases, a class that includes this case.  If two claims, such as common-law false arrest and constitutional false arrest, or common-law assault and constitutional assault (as alleged here), are so alike that \"plaintiffs can be expected to plead [the] common law [claim] as a pendent claim in constitutional suits,\" Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d at 176 n. 9 (false arrest), then the same judgment about repose applies to both claims.  For such pairs of claims, the facts to be proved are largely the same, and principally for that reason but also because the two claims grow out of the same incident and seek to vindicate the same interests, settled expectations must be judged the same.  Here, we conclude, the local-law claim that is \"closely analogous\" to the constitutional assault claim is the common-law assault claim.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      Turning to the second aspect of the Johnson rule, appellant argues that, even if the most closely analogous claim to his constitutional assault claim is one subject to a one-year limitations period, application of the one-year period would be \"inconsistent with the federal policy underlying the [constitutional] cause of action,\" Johnson, 421 U.S. at 465, 95 S.Ct. at 1722.  Appellant\\'s arguments in support of this contention, however, are the same general ones advanced in support of the contention that his constitutional claim is not analogous to his common-law claim.  They fare no better in this context than in that.  In Johnson the Supreme Court rejected the proposition that there is \"anything peculiar to a federal civil rights action that would justify special reluctance in applying state law.\"    421 U.S. at 464, 95 S.Ct. at 1722.  In Tomanio the Court observed that application of state limitations periods is not inconsistent with either of the two principal policies embodied in section 1983, deterrence and compensation.  446 U.S. at 488, 100 S.Ct. at 1797.  It also observed that the need for uniformity does not \"warrant the displacement of state statutes of limitations for civil rights actions.\"    Id. at 489, 100 S.Ct. at 1797.8   The Court referred to Robertson v. Wegmann, 436 U.S. 584, 593, 98 S.Ct. 1991, 1996, 56 L.Ed.2d 554 (1978), as establishing that \" \\'[a] state statute cannot be considered \"inconsistent\" with federal law merely because the statute causes the plaintiff to lose the litigation.\\' \"    446 U.S. at 488, 100 S.Ct. at 1797.  Appellant here has pointed to nothing more than that.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      Finally, we find no merit in the argument that D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(4)\\'s one-year period is simply too short for application to the constitutional cause of action.  Nothing in Johnson or Tomanio suggests that a one-year period is, solely by virtue of its duration, inconsistent with any federal policy behind Constitution-based actions, including those of deterrence and compensation.    Johnson may even be read to suggest, by omission, that one year is sufficient:  the opinion lists (though does not address) several possible challenges to the one-year period presumed applicable;  a challenge based simply on the length of the period is not among those listed.  421 U.S. at 462 n. 7, 95 S.Ct. at 1721 n. 7.  In any event, we fail to see how a court could determine how long a limitations period should be for a given claim except by drawing analogies to claims with specific periods, and that task is one built into the first aspect of the Johnson rule.  Mere shortness of time provides no independent ground for rejecting a state limitations rule.9\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      In short, appellant\\'s constitutional assault claim is closely analogous in the relevant respect to the common-law assault cause of action for which D.C.Code Sec. 12-301(4) provides a one-year limitations period.  Application of that period is not inconsistent with any federal policy underlying the constitutional cause of action.  The one-year period therefore applies to, and bars, appellant\\'s claim.\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      On remand, the district court should examine the validity of service on defendants Davis, Pyles, Wright, Andres, Everett, and Jacobs.  It should also allow appellant an opportunity to amend his complaint to allege some actionable misconduct (in the incidents described in the complaint) on the part of named defendants other than Davis and Pyles.  Only those defendants properly served and adequately charged with misconduct may remain in the case;  they will remain, however, for purposes of the two surviving nonconstitutional tort claims as well as their constitutional analogues.  Those claims are the June 1979 assault claim and the February 1978 seizure and conversion claim, in both their constitutional and common-law forms.  All other claims are dismissed, and the District of Columbia is dismissed as a party on all claims.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         Although the District of Columbia is not named in the complaint as a party, the district court treated it as a party, and no named party has challenged that treatment\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         Appellee contends that the factual allegations in the complaint cannot give rise to a Fourth Amendment violation.  Because this argument was not addressed below, we do not here analyze the legal standards to be applied, leaving that task to be performed in the first instance by the district court, which might require fuller development of the factual record before addressing the issue\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         In this case, we may reach the same conclusion by a different route.  The factual basis for appellant\\'s constitutional false-arrest claim is that the gun he was convicted of possessing was planted on him by the arresting police.  That contention, however, was appellant\\'s defense at his criminal trial, and the jury resolved the factual issue raised by that claim against him, a resolution upheld by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  See Appendix to Brief of Appellee.  Appellant should be precluded from relitigating the issue here\\n        Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980), held that collateral estoppel should bar an action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 (1976) based on factual claims actually, fairly, and fully litigated, and decided against the section 1983 claimant, in an earlier state-court trial, even where the trial was a criminal trial in which the section 1983 claimant was the defendant.  That decision rests on the Supreme Court\\'s conclusion that section 1983 was not intended to derogate from the federal courts\\' general, deep-rooted practice of applying collateral estoppel to state-court judgments.  The creation of Bivens-type causes of action was likewise not so intended, the purpose being merely to create a damages remedy, parallel to section 1983, against federal officials in some circumstances.   See Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979);  Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).  For that reason, and because fairness and judicial orderliness are served by maintaining that parallelism, collateral estoppel should apply in Bivens-type actions as it applies in section 1983 actions.  The factual basis of appellant\\'s constitutional false-arrest claim having already been decided against him in the District of Columbia criminal proceedings, his claim must be dismissed.\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         We thus treat the District of Columbia as a state, see Forrestal Village, Inc. v. Graham, 551 F.2d 411, 413 (D.C.Cir.1977), because there is no evidence that Congress specifically contemplated its own causes of action, such as section 1983, in enacting the D.C.Code statute of limitations\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         In Payne v. Government of the District of Columbia, 559 F.2d 809, 817 n. 32 (D.C.Cir.1977) (opinion of Robinson, J.), Judge (now Chief Judge) Robinson stated in passing that the interests protected by a constitutional cause of action for certain assaults differed from those protected by the local cause of action for assault.  But Judge Robinson was not speaking for the court, and he did not, in any case, argue that the differences he alluded to entailed a difference in the applicable statute of limitations\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         The special character of constitutional claims might be indicated by Congress\\'s having provided for the awarding of attorney\\'s fees to plaintiffs who win on some civil rights claims.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988 (1976).  Because it is doubtful that Congress could similarly provide for attorney\\'s fees in state common-law actions, however, the federal attorney\\'s fees statute cannot be considered strong evidence of Congress\\'s view of the importance of constitutional claims against government officials relative to analogous common-law claims against such officials\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         Not all facts put in issue by a given claim are important in the task of comparison.

That advantage, however, is irrelevant for many Constitution-based claims, such as the assault claim here, and it can be achieved in many cases by staying civil cases pending completion of a related criminal case\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 413119}]"},{"id":763043,"date_filed":"1999-04-16","judges":null,"case_name_full":"Joyce Tolbert, Venita Rodgers, Veronica Cherry, Laurel Nemec, Patricia Nettles, and Stella Campbell v.

The district court ruled that their claims were barred by the applicable two-year statutes of limitation, finding that the Cherrywood residents\\' cause of action had accrued in 1984 when ODOT approved a highway-construction plan that did not include sound barriers near Cherrywood.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      The complaint, however, challenges the discriminatory allocation of sound barriers, not the initial failure of ODOT to provide such barriers near Cherrywood.  As a result, the Cherrywood residents\\' cause of action did not accrue until (1) the request for sound barriers in their largely African-American neighborhood had been denied, and (2) they knew or had reason to know that ODOT was in the process of providing sound barriers in a similarly-situated white neighborhood.  We therefore REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n    \\n    I. BACKGROUND\\n    A. The Plaintiffs\\n    \\n      3\\n      The Plaintiffs are residents of Cherrywood.  According to a 1990 census, 84f the Cherrywood residents are African-American.  Over 71% of the households in Cherrywood\\'s census tract had annual incomes of less than $10,000.\\n    \\n    B. The Parkway\\n    \\n      4\\n      The Buckeye Basin Greenbelt Parkway (the \"Parkway\") is a federally-funded highway currently under construction in Toledo, Ohio.  The northbound lanes of the Parkway are located approximately 75 to 100 feet from Cherrywood.  Planning for the Parkway began in the 1970s.  ODOT claims that it conducted 17 public meetings to discuss the Parkway project between 1979 and 1982, but the record is devoid of information about the notification procedures except for one of the public meetings in 1982.  The Cherrywood residents allege that ODOT did not conduct any meetings specifically with them.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Federal Highway Administration (\"FHWA\") conducted an initial noise analysis for the Parkway project.  One such analysis indicated that the existing noise level at Cherrywood was approximately 79 decibels.  The Cherrywood residents allege that the current specifications for the Parkway will elevate that noise level to 90 decibels, an increase of over 10 decibels.  In 1982, the FHWA incorporated its noise analysis into an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\").  The EIS recommended against building sound barriers around the Parkway because that would be impractical \"due to the influence of traffic generating noise from Cherry Street and to the industrial background noise from the adjacent area.\"   In 1984, the FHWA approved the EIS.  Between 1984 and 1995, the FHWA made various changes to the Parkway plans.  On January 19, 1995, the FWHA determined that because the changes were not \"substantial,\" no supplemental EIS was necessary.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Construction of the Parkway began in 1996, and is ongoing.  In 1996, the Cherrywood residents requested that ODOT reopen the question of whether to provide noise-mitigation measures on the Parkway project.  ODOT officials refused to do so, stating that the Cherrywood residents could have attended the various public meetings in the 1980s.\\n    \\n    C. The I-75 Expansion\\n    \\n      7\\n      ODOT also made plans to widen Interstate 75 in Toledo in the 1980s.  According to the 1990 census, 86% of the residents in the 18 census blocks immediately adjacent to the I-75 widening project (known as \"Point Place\") are Caucasian.  Sixty percent of the households in the five adjacent census tracts had annual incomes of over $25,000.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      According to a 1983 ODOT noise analysis, the widening of I-75 would result in noise levels between 70 and 82 decibels in the adjacent neighborhoods, creating an increase of no more than three decibels above the original sound level.  The noise analysis recommended against the construction of sound barriers for the I-75 widening.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      ODOT has nonetheless since decided to construct sound barriers adjacent to I-75.  The Cherrywood residents allege that the City of Toledo was involved in this decision.  Construction commenced in the summer of 1996.\\n    \\n    D. Procedural Background\\n    \\n      10\\n      The Cherrywood residents filed a six-count complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on August 26, 1997.  It named ODOT, its director Jerry Wray, and the City of Toledo as defendants.  The complaint states in pertinent part as follows:\\n    \\n    Discrimination Against Plaintiff Class\\n    \\n      11\\n      19.  In analyzing the noise impact of the Parkway, defendants, inter alia, incorrectly measured existing noise levels, failed to evaluate meaningfully noise abatement measures, and failed to take into consideration the views of the impacted residents in violation of 23 C.F.R. &#167; 772.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      20. In designing, approving, and constructing the Parkway, defendants failed to assess whether the allocation of sound mitigation measures and consideration of alternative Parkway alignments complied with Title VI, Title VIII, and other civil rights requirements.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      21. Defendants failed to provide plaintiffs, the African-American population residing in the Cherrywood apartments and nearby residential properties, with sound mitigation measures or other design alternatives to lessen the noise impact of the Parkway.  Plaintiffs allege that defendants\\' discriminatory refusal to approve sound mitigation measures or other design alternatives and defendants\\' discriminatory allocation of mitigation measures between Point Place and Cherrywood disproportionately imposes environmental and health burdens of freeway construction on the basis of race.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      22. Defendants do not advance any reason rising to the level of necessity, to justify:  (1) the absence of noise mitigation measures or other design alternatives at the  southwestern terminus of the Parkway or (2) the disparity in the allocation of mitigation measures between predominantly white areas along I-75 and predominantly African-American area surrounding Cherrywood apartments.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      The complaint then alleges that the above facts constitute violations of (1) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d;  (2) U.S. Department of Transportation regulations implementing Title VI;  (3) The Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3601;  (4) The Civil Rights Act of 1870, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981;  (5) The Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1982;  and (6) The Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      In November of 1997, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The motion alleged that the complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  In December of 1997, the Cherrywood residents filed their first amended complaint, alleging that they did not learn that the Parkway project would pass near their homes until construction commenced in 1996.  It further states that \"Defendants actions ... continue through the present time.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      The district court granted the defendants\\' motion to dismiss the complaint in February of 1998.  First, the court noted that all of the federal statutes under which the Cherrywood residents had brought their claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations.  It then concluded that the cause of action accrued in 1984, when the Parkway EIS was approved.  The district court also found that the failure to erect sound barriers was not a \"continuing violation\" that would prevent the limitations period from lapsing.  It thus concluded that all of the Cherrywood residents\\' claims were time-barred.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Additionally, the district court opined that even if the claims of the Cherrywood residents were not time-barred, they would not prevail on the merits.  In so stating, the court specifically said that its analysis of the merits was not necessary to its ruling on the statute of limitations issue.\\n    \\n    II. ANALYSIS\\n    \\n      19\\n      A. The Cherrywood residents\\' cause of action for discrimination accrued when they knew or had reason to know of the allegedly discriminatory allocation of sound-mitigation measures\\n    \\n    1. Standard of review\\n    \\n      20\\n      The determination that a complaint was filed outside of the applicable statute of limitations is a conclusion of law that this court reviews de novo.  See Farber v. Massillon Board of Educ., 917 F.2d 1391, 1399 (6th Cir.1990).\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      2. The Cherrywood residents\\' claims of discriminatory allocation of sound-mitigation measures arose at the time that they knew or should have known of ODOT\\'s allegedly discriminatory conduct\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      In dismissing the Cherrywood residents\\' claims in their entirety, the district court relied upon Sierra Club v. Slater, 120 F.3d 623 (6th Cir.1997), for the proposition that \"[a] cause of action arising out of an improper EIS generally accrues when the EIS is approved.\"  Sierra Club concerned the same Parkway project that is at issue here.  See id. at 623.   In Sierra Club, the plaintiff challenged a decision to fill wetlands in connection with the construction of the Parkway.  See id. at 629.   After finding that the gravamen of the lawsuit was a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), this court concluded that the Sierra Club\\'s cause of action accrued when \"final agency action\" occurred.  See id. at 631.   The Sierra Club court then found that approval of the EIS constituted \"final agency action\" under the APA.  See id.   But Sierra Club does not stand for the proposition that all claims related to projects for which an EIS is issued accrue at the time that the EIS is approved.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Implicit in the district court\\'s dismissal of this lawsuit is its characterization of the suit as \"a cause of action arising out of an improper EIS.\"  In fact, the complaint does contain allegations that the EIS was improper.  In one paragraph, for instance, the Cherrywood residents allege that ODOT incorrectly measured existing noise levels.  But the complaint also states that the defendants\\' \"discriminatory allocation of mitigation measures between Point Place and Cherrywood disproportionately imposes environmental and health burdens of freeway construction on the basis of race.\"   At some point before 1996, ODOT (and, allegedly, the City of Toledo) made the decision to provide sound barriers along I-75 in spite of the noise analysis that recommended a decision to the contrary.  At about the same time that the construction of these barriers commenced, counsel for the Cherrywood residents requested that ODOT reconsider providing such barriers on the Parkway near Cherrywood.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      The essence of the claim in the present case is that ODOT made a racially based decision to utilize limited funds to provide sound barriers near a white neighborhood rather than near a black neighborhood.  Although sound barriers were not recommended for either project, the complaint alleges that the noise analyses showed that the Parkway project would result in a greater increase in noise levels than would the I-75 widening.  To the extent that the Cherrywood residents claim discrimination in the allocation of sound-mitigation measures, their cause of action did not accrue until they knew, or should have known, that ODOT was allocating such resources in an allegedly discriminatory manner.  See Sevier v. Turner, 742 F.2d 262, 273 (6th Cir.1984) (\"A plaintiff has reason to know of his injury when he should have discovered it through the exercise of reasonable diligence.\").\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      The Cherrywood residents state that they did not become aware of ODOT\\'s plan to construct sound barriers on I-75 until they saw such barriers being built in the summer of 1996.  Although the evidence in the record is insufficient to indicate whether they had constructive notice of the sound barriers before that time, it does show that the Cherrywood residents requested sound barriers for the Parkway project in 1996.  Their cause of action for discriminatory allocation of sound-mitigation measures thus accrued when (a) their request for such measures was denied, and (b) they knew or should have known that sound barriers were to be constructed around the I-75 widening project.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      All of the Cherrywood residents\\' claims are governed by a two-year statute of limitations.  See Collyer v. Darling, 98 F.3d 211, 220 (6th Cir.1996) (holding that Ohio\\'s two-year statute of limitations is generally applicable to civil rights claims brought in that state);  42 U.S.C. &#167; 3613(a)(1)(A) (providing a two-year limitation on Fair Housing Act claims).  The present state of the record shows that the Cherrywood residents\\' request for sound barriers was denied in 1996, and that they had no actual or constructive knowledge of the I-75 sound-barrier construction until the summer of that year.  Their complaint, filed on August 26, 1997, was thus timely under the applicable statute of limitations.  We therefore reverse the district court\\'s judgment to the extent that it prevents the Cherrywood residents from proceeding forward with their claim that ODOT and the other defendants discriminated in choosing to provide sound barriers along I-75 but not along the Parkway.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      3. Any claims relating to the Parkway EIS are time-barred\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      a. Claims arising out of the Parkway EIS accrued when it was approved\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      The Cherrywood residents allege that no meeting was held with them before the Parkway EIS was approved.  They do not allege, however, that any attempt was made to conceal the public-meeting process from them, or that ODOT did not make reasonable efforts to put them on notice.  The Cherrywood residents neither dispute ODOT\\'s assertion that it provided general public notice about at least one of the meetings, nor allege that they could not have discovered, through reasonable diligence, the existence of the Parkway project and of its proximity to Cherrywood.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      Instead, they assert that they \"did not learn of Parkway construction plans through newspapers, television, fliers, or word of mouth\" and that they \"had no knowledge that defendants planned to construct the Parkway through their neighborhood until 1996 when construction activities commenced.\"   These allegations are insufficient to toll the statute of limitations.  Because any claims arising out of ODOT\\'s preparation and approval of the EIS accrued in 1984, far more than two years before the complaint was filed, such claims are now time-barred.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      b. The EIS itself does not create a \"continuing violation\"\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      The Cherrywood residents alternatively contend that the alleged EIS violations are not time-barred because they constitute \"continuing violations.\"   This court has adopted a three-part inquiry for determining whether a continuing violation exists.  First, the defendant\\'s wrongful conduct must continue after the precipitating event that began the pattern (in this case, the approval of the EIS).  Second, injury to the plaintiff must continue to accrue after that event.  Finally, further injury to the plaintiffs must have been avoidable if the defendants had at any time ceased their wrongful conduct.  See Kuhnle Brothers, Inc. v. County of Geauga, 103 F.3d 516, 522 (6th Cir.1997) (holding that the deprivation of a trucking company\\'s liberty interest in intrastate travel was a \"continuing violation\").\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      ODOT\\'s approval of the Parkway EIS, its I-75 noise analysis, and its subsequent decision to allocate sound-mitigation resources to the I-75 project but not to the Parkway project are not all part of a \"pattern\" as discussed in Kuhnle Brothers.   To the contrary, it is precisely because ODOT\\'s decision to build sound barriers on I-75 had nothing to do with either the Parkway EIS or the I-75 noise analysis that the Cherrywood residents\\' claims of discriminatory allocation of resources accrued at a later time.\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      ODOT\\'s actions with reference to the Parkway EIS do not meet the first prong of the test set forth in Kuhnle Brothers.   Approval of the EIS was a discrete event.  In addition, no allegations have been made that ODOT concealed information relevant to the sound-mitigation needs of the Parkway or otherwise engaged in wrongful conduct that continued after its decision to approve the EIS.\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      The present case also fails the second prong of the Kuhnle Brothers test because the Cherrywood residents\\' injury from the approval of the EIS was complete in 1984.  As the Fourth Circuit noted in National Advertising Co. v. City of Raleigh, 947 F.2d 1158, 1166 (4th Cir.1991), \"[a] continuing violation is occasioned by continual unlawful acts, not continual ill effects from an original violation.\"  (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  In this case, to the extent that the Cherrywood residents complain of injury from ODOT\\'s failure to recommend sound-mitigation measures in the EIS, the continuing lack of such measures constitutes a \"continuing ill effect,\" and is not the result of continuing unlawful acts.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      As to the third prong of the Kuhnle Brothers test, it too cannot be met by the Cherrywood residents because ODOT\\'s adherence to the Parkway EIS was not a continuing course of conduct.  Although construction of sound barriers would avoid further injury to the Cherrywood residents, this is true of every case where the complaint involves the failure to provide a public amenity.  Passive inaction, however, does not support a continuing violation theory.\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      The district court noted that the continuing violation theory is rarely successful outside of the Title VII discrimination area.  It then provided a thorough and well-reasoned analysis of those few federal cases that deal with the continuing effects of discrete acts such as approval of an EIS.  Of the various cases relied upon by the Cherrywood residents, the only one that might arguably serve to bring ODOT\\'s actions in the 1980s within the \"continuing violation\" theory is Palmer v. Board of Educ., 46 F.3d 682 (7th Cir.1995).  Palmer addressed the question of whether an allegedly discriminatory school-closing plan constituted a continuing violation.  In the school district at issue, there had been two junior high schools--one predominantly African-American and the other predominantly Caucasian.  The district closed the predominantly African-American school and bussed the students to the other.  The parents of an African-American student sued, claiming that the closing was discriminatory.  In holding that the claim was not time-barred, the Seventh Circuit stated that \"[i]f, as plaintiffs believe, the school board\\'s explanation for closing Deer Creek is a pretext for discrimination, then each year\\'s decision to leave the building shuttered is a new violation....\"  Id. at 686.   The Seventh Circuit compared these annual decisions with the implementation of a discriminatory pay scale, which generates a wrongful act each pay period.  See id.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      Under the theory articulated in Palmer, ODOT\\'s continuing adherence to the Parkway EIS arguably constitutes a series of decisions not to build sound barriers.  But this case is distinguishable from Palmer in that the EIS sound-barrier decisions on the Parkway and I-75 projects have not been systematically and repeatedly revisited.  Although the school board in Palmer had to make a choice between only two options--the predominantly Caucasian school and the predominantly African-American school--at the beginning of each school year, there is no indication that ODOT revisited the EIS issue at regular intervals.  Thus any claims contained in the complaint that relate to the creation and adoption of the Parkway EIS are time-barred because they do not satisfy the requirements for a \"continuing violation.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      B. The district court has not properly ruled on the merits of the plaintiffs\\' claims\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      Even though the district court dismissed this suit on the basis that it was barred by the applicable two-year statutes of limitation, it volunteered that \"[a]lthough it is not necessary to the Court\\'s determination, the Court finds further that Plaintiffs could not prevail on the merits even if they had standing to bring their claim.\"   The district court then stated that the Cherrywood residents would have to prove intentional discrimination in order to prevail.  Although the opinion did not discuss whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted, the district court pointed out the procedural hurdles that the Cherrywood residents might face in establishing what they allege.  Such an analysis is appropriate at the summary judgment stage, when the parties have had an opportunity to develop their proof through discovery, but it is not a basis for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Bloch v. Ribar, 156 F.3d 673, 686 (6th Cir.1998) (stating that although the district court might be justified in dismissing the plaintiffs\\' privacy claim at the summary judgment stage in the absence of additional proof, the plaintiffs were only required to create a foundation for recovery to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)).\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      In the present case, the Cherrywood residents have alleged the following facts in their complaint:  (1) that neither the Parkway project nor the I-75 widening was initially designated by ODOT as requiring sound barriers;  (2) that the Parkway project would result in a greater increase in background noise than would the I-75 widening;  (3) that the residents of the area adjacent to the Parkway project are mostly African-American and overwhelmingly low-income;  (4) that the residents in the area adjacent to the I-75 widening are mostly Caucasian and have higher incomes;  and (5) that sound barriers are being constructed around the I-75 widening without justification.  The Cherrywood residents allege that they have been injured by ODOT\\'s actions and that such actions are the result of intentional discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      As noted by the district court, \"[t]he Court is without authority to dismiss the claims unless it can be demonstrated beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle it to relief.\"   See Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).  The question of whether the above allegations, if true, state a claim under the various civil rights statutes upon which the Cherrywood residents rely has not yet been properly brought before the district court.  We therefore remand this case for its further consideration.  Without passing on the merits of this issue, we can at least say that it is by no means obvious that the complaint is deficient as a matter of law.\\n    \\n    III. CONCLUSION\\n    \\n      43\\n      For all of the reasons stated above, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 763043}]"},{"id":284392,"date_filed":"1969-04-01","judges":"Aldisert, Seitz, Stahl","case_name_full":"Leo ROSEN, Utility Co-Workers Association and Morgan Sweeney, Appellants, v.

First, the court was of the opinion that because the alleged unfair employment practice, discrimination in pension rights on the basis of sex, had been rectified by a collective bargaining agreement negotiated subsequent to proceedings before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the filing of the suit, the issues raised by the complaint had become moot.  Secondly in dealing with an amendment to the appellants' complaint, which alleged that the appellee-company was still discriminating on account of sex in the pension arrangement under the new collective bargaining agreement, the court concluded that because the latter contention had never been the subject matter of a charge filed with the EEOC,2 the court lacked jurisdiction.3\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      The appellants, Rosen, Sweeney and Utility Co-Workers Association, a certified bargaining representative for about 1,800 of the 15,000 employees of appellee, Public Service Electric and Gas Company, filed charges in 19654 with the EEOC alleging that appellee was committing an unlawful employment practice within the meaning of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by maintaining a pension plan that discriminated on the basis of sex because it permitted retirement at different ages and length of service for men and women.5\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Under the original pension plan male employees could retire at 65 with 25 years of service, with mandatory retirement at age 70.  Female employees could retire at age 60 with 20 years' service and retirement was mandatory at age 65. The plan also provided for early retirement for male employees at the age of 60, but before attaining the age of 65, upon completion of 30 years of service.  Male employees taking early retirement had their pension benefits reduced by a specified rate.6\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      According to appellants, a male employee taking early retirement at age 60, after 30 years' service, would receive a substantially lower pension than a female employee retiring at the same age, with the same length of service, assuming the same average annual salary.7\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      After the charges were filed with the EEOC, and following an investigation, the Commission issued a decision, dated January 26, 1966, finding reasonable cause to believe that the pension plan violated Title VII.8  By letter dated February 9, 1966, the Director of Compliance of the EEOC informed appellant Rosen that such reasonable cause had been found, and that the Commission would attempt to eliminate the practice by conciliation.9  By another letter, also dated February 9, 1966, Mr. Rosen was advised by the Director of Compliance that due to the heavy workload of the Commission, it had not been possible to undertake or to conclude the conciliation efforts, but that conciliation would be undertaken and continued.10\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      Mr. Rosen was further notified that under Section 706(e) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he had the right to bring suit in the district court within thirty days after the receipt of the letter.  Suit was instituted on March 9, 1966, with Rosen, Sweeney and the union named as plaintiffs.11\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      During the pendency of the suit, the union and the appellee-company negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement effective May 1, 1967, which, inter alia, modified the pension plan by erasing the differences in the optional and mandatory retirement ages for men and women, thus apparently eliminating the predicate of appellants' initial complaint.  All employees were permitted to retire at 65, with compulsory retirement at 70.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      The modified pension plan also provided for early retirement for all employees at age 60, on a reduced pension, after 20 years of service.  Female employees electing early retirement would not suffer any reduction in benefits on account of service prior to May 1, 1967.12 No similar provision was made for male employees electing early retirement.13\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      Following the adoption of the new collective bargaining agreement, the district court, on December 21, 1967, orally granted leave to appellants at pretrial conference 'to file an amended' complaint to allege that the modified pension plan also violated Title VII of the Act.  (App. 64a).\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      While we cannot find in the record that an amendment to the original complaint, or an amended complaint, was actually filed, the parties and the court proceeded in the action further as if amendment had been accomplished.  For example, in its motion for summary judgment, appellee lists as one of its grounds:\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      3.  The revised negotiated Pension Plan does not discriminate within the purview of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  (App. 68a).\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Likewise, in its briefs to this court appellee refers to the 'oral amendment' of the complaint at the pretrial conference.  (Main brief, p. 2; reply brief, p. 2.).\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      In the oral opinion rendered by the court below, the judge stated:\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      I consider that I am without jurisdiction at this particular time to grant the relief sought by way of the amendments to the pleadings set forth in the pretrial order.  (App. 110a).\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Thus in our disposition of this appeal we will treat the complaint as if an amendment had been filed.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      On March 19, 1968, the district court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment.14  The court was of the opinion that the modification of the pension plan rendered the original complaint moot.  Summary judgment was granted as to the amendment to the complaint on the ground that no charges had been filed with the EEOC alleging that the modified pension plan constituted an unfair employment practice;15 hence, the administrative remedies under the 1964 Act had not been exhausted.16\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      On this appeal the appellants and the EEOC, appearing as amicus curiae, contend that the original complaint was not mooted by the May 1, 1967, revision in the pension plan because of the possibility that some employees may have suffered money damages before the change was made, and because the district court had failed to determine whether injunctive relief was necessary to protect the public interest against the alleged continuing discrimination by appellee on the basis of sex.  The EEOC argues that the policy expressed in Title VII will be frustrated if parties-defendant in a Title VII proceeding are permitted 'to place plaintiffs on an administrative treadmill by compelling litigants to go back to the Commission every time there is an alleged change in a discriminatory practice.'17\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      We find merit in the first part of appellants' argument, i.e., the possibility of some of the employees of the appellee-company having suffered harm before the May 1, 1967 pension plan modification.  See Jenkins v. United Gas Corp.,  400 F.2d 28 (5th Cir. 1968).18  Accordingly, insofar as the original complaint is concerned, the case will be remanded for a determination as to whether any of the named appellants, and any other male members of the union,19 may have retired between the date of the initial 1965 charges before the EEOC and the May 1, 1967 change, and thus may have been harmed by the alleged discrimination in the pension benefit formula.20  Such a finding, of course, would require the court to rule on whether the original pension plan, prior to its modification, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.21\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      If the district court does not find any party entitled to the kind of relief above described for harm caused by alleged discrimination prior to the May 1, 1967 pension plan revision, then we agree with the appellee that the issues raised in the original complaint are moot.  We recognize that the complaint specifically requested injunctive relief, and we have studied carefully the position of the EEOC that the strong policy behind the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would normally support the grant of an injunction to make certain that an employer who has voluntarily stopped discriminatory practices continues to hew to the proper course.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      As the appellee points out, and as is implicit in the cases upon which the EEOC relies, e.g., Jenkins v. United Gas Corp., supra, this kind of injunctive relief is particularly appropriate in the sensitive area of racial discrimination where the Commission and the courts should make sure that once the formal proceedings have ended the ugly face of bias does not reappear.  But this is not such a case.  We do not make the distinction on the basis that discrimination on account of sex is any less reprehensible or any less protected than discrimination because of race.  We make the distinction because here we have a written modification of a pension plan, embodied in a collective bargaining agreement, which excised the age differentials in retirement between men and women to which the original complaint was addressed.  We conclude, therefore, that if no male employee was harmed by the pre-May 1967 pension plan, that should dispose of the original complaint and injunctive relief is unnecessary.22\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      Turning now to the amendment to the original complaint which alleged continuing discrimination under the modified pension plan, we have already noted that a second suit has been filed duplicating the charge that the modified plan violates Title VII.  Because this second suit has not yet been disposed of, and because it deals with precisely the same substantive issues as the amendment to the original complaint, we deem it unnecessary to determine whether the grant of summary judgment as to that portion of the first complaint was in error.23  It was suggested at oral argument that consolidation of the two actions, i.e., the original complaint as amended and the second complaint, would be sought if this court directed a remand.  We believe that this would be the proper procedure to follow and that upon such consolidation the issues involved in the initial complaint, the amendment thereto, and the second complaint, can be sifted out and disposition made of them.24\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      As a matter of form, one other issue must be dealt with.  Appellee moved to dismiss the appeal, and argument on the motion was heard at the time of the hearing on the merits.  The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      The judgment of the district court will be vacated and the case will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.25\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      SEITZ, Circuit Judge (dissenting).\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      The original complaint filed in this action on March 9, 1966, was based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  It explicitly sought declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the defendant's then pension plan.  The gravamen of the complaint was that the plan violated the Act because it discriminated in several respects in favor of female employees and in others, in favor of male employees.  After the action was commenced, the defendant company revised the plan.  Thereafter the plaintiffs amended their complaint1 to challenge the plan as revised and to assert a class action.  Still later defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on several grounds.  In amending their complaint plaintiffs made it clear that they were not withdrawing the original complaint, even though they conceded that the bulk of the specific grievances alleged may have been rectified by the adoption of the revised plan.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      The district court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment.  Apparently the district court believed that the subject matter of the original complaint had been rendered moot by the revision of the pension plan and that only the amended complaint was before it.  The amended complaint was dismissed on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction over its subject matter, because plaintiffs had not complied with the procedural requirements of the Act by first requesting relief from the EEOC.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      As I understand the majority opinion, the court is remanding the subject matter of the original complaint to the district court to have it determined if there are any employees, apparently treated as a class, who were injured by the alleged violation of the Act in the period prior to the modification of the plan.  If not, then presumably under the majority decision, the district court properly viewed the original complaint as moot.  If so, then the majority would direct the district court to decide whether plaintiffs have otherwise stated a legally cognizable claim.  Although I agree with the majority that there should be a remand, I think their remand is too restrictive.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      By their original complaint the plaintiffs sought, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the plan violated the Act.  The defendant raised many defenses, including the contention that Title VII of the Act did not apply to pension retirement plans.  I think plaintiffs were entitled to have a declaration as to whether Title VII was applicable to the plan and, If so, whether the plan violated the Act.  The revision of the plan did not render these important issues moot; the parties were still very much concerned with their resolution.  Indeed, the issue of the applicability of Title VII was reasserted by the defendant after the plaintiffs amended the complaint.  Moreover, it was a particularly appropriate subject for a declaratory judgment in view of the public policy overtones involved.2\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      Plaintiffs also sought injunctive relief.  Were the district court to decide that Title VII applies to pension plans and that the revised plan was in violation of the Act then the court would be obliged to consider the need for an injunction.  Contrary to the majority's approach, I think that it is premature to consider the propriety of injunctive relief in view of the fact that the question was not presented or decided below, and because the basis for such a determination has not been developed.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      I next consider the dismissal of the amendment to the complaint by the district court on the ground that plaintiffs had not exhausted their remedies before the Commission as was said to be required by the Act.  42 U.S.C.A. 2000e-5(e).  The majority decided that this issue need not be resolved.  I am forced to disagree.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      Preliminarily, although the district court posed the issue in terms of its jurisdiction, it had jurisdiction and the issue is whether the statutory prerequisite has been satisfied.\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      Considering the discrimination charged in the amendement with that in the original complaint,3 I conclude that the subject matter is so interrelated that the Act does not require plaintiffs to again petition the Commission in order that the district court might properly consider the amendment.  A purpose for first proceeding before the Commission in this type of case is to permit an amicable settlement without litigation.  When grievances are obviously independent, that statutory purpose is best served by first resorting to conciliation before the EEOC.  However, and as the EEOC urges, where, as here, the basic grievance had been 'processed' by the Commission and litigation recommended, no statutory purpose is served by forcing further conciliation efforts.  I therefore believe that it was error to grant summary judgment on the ground relied upon by the district court.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         Section 703(a)(1), 42 U.S.C.A. 2000e-2\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         As will appear later, a charge against the revised pension plan had in fact been filed with the EEOC, but had not been called to the attention of the court prior to its decision.  However, authority to file suit on this later charge had not been officially granted by the EEOC prior to the date of the amendment of the complaint or the lower court's decision.  See note 15, infra\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Section 706(e), 42 U.S.C.A. 2000e-5(e).  For the conditions precedent to the filing of a civil action, see note 11, infra\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         After the initial court suit was instituted in 1966 about 35 other employees filed charges with the EEOC.  The additional charges were consolidated by the Commission with those filed in 1965.  Appendix (App.) 80a-85a\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         Discrimination was also claimed in a job assignment provision of the collective bargaining agreement between the parties which provided that,\\n        If a male employee who is 60 years of age or over, or a female employee who is 55 years of age or over, is assigned to a lower classification not for incapacity, but because of the elimination of his job, his existing rate shall not be lowered by virtue of the assignment to a lower-rated job.\\n        This provision was eliminated in the May 1, 1967 revision of the collective bargaining agreement, App. 60a, and appears to be no longer in issue.\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         The relevant sections of the pension plan (established in 1911 according to appellee and in effect up to the time of the May 1, 1967 revision), which formed the basis of the initial complaint, were as follows:\\n        Section 3.  Each male employee may at his option retire at age sixty-five or thereafter upon completion of twenty-five years of service, and must retire at age seventy.  Each female employee may at her option retire at age sixty or thereafter upon completion of twenty years of service, and must retire at age sixty-five.\\n        Section 4.  Each employee who retires under the provisions of this Pension Plan relating to normal retirement for age shall be paid for life, in monthly installments, a pension computed at the annual rate of 1% Of the average annual wage or salary of such employee for the five years of highest earnings within the last ten years of the employee's service, multiplied by the number of years, and any fraction of a year, of the employee's service.\\n        Section 5.  Each male employee may at his option retire at age sixty or thereafter but before attainment of age sixty-five upon completion of thirty years of service.\\n        Section 6.  Each male employee who retires under the provisions of this Pension Plan relating to early retirement shall be paid for life, in monthly installments, a pension computed at the annual rate of 1% Of the average annual wage or salary of such employee for the five years of highest earnings within the last ten years of the employee's service, multiplied by the number of years, and any fraction of a year, of the employee's service, (and reduced by one-half of 1% For each month that such employee is less than age sixty-five at the time of his retirement.)  (App. 2a.)\\n        The bracketed portion of Section 6 was modified prior to the filing of the initial suit to provide that,\\n        An employee who becomes eligible for early retirement under the present early retirement provisions of the Pension Plan and is sixty-two years old but less than age sixty-five will have his pension reduced by one-quarter of 1% For each month that he is less than age sixty-five at the time of retirement.  The present reduction is one-half of 1% Per month for this span of years.\\n        An employee eligible for early retirement under present provisions who is sixty years old but less than age sixty-two will have his pension reduced by one-quarter of 1% For each of the thirty-six months below age sixty-five and one-half of 1% For each month that he is below age sixty-two at the time of retirement.  (App. 56a.)\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         Appellants' brief, p. 3\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         App. 13a.  While the discrimination found was generally against male employees, the Commission also said that,\\n        Female employees are disadvantaged by the discriminatory operation of the pension plan in that it is compulsory that they retire at age 65 even though some fermale employees who may be able and physically desirous of working five additional years would not be permitted to do so, * * *\\n        It should be noted that appellant-union represents both male and female employees.\\n      \\n      \\n        9\\n         App. 11a\\n      \\n      \\n        10\\n         App. 12a\\n      \\n      \\n        11\\n         There is conflicting evidence in the record as to whether conciliation efforts had been undertaken before the EEOC's letter authorizing suit was sent and before and after suit was filed.  (App. 49a, 50a, 69a, 71a, 76a-79a.)  In view of recent decisions in a number of circuits, it appears that, at least as of the time this suit was initially brought, actual efforts at conciliation by the EEOC were not a prerequisite to the filing of a civil action under Title VII so long as a charge had been filed with the Commission and the statutory notice had been received from the EEOC that it had been unable to obtain voluntary compliance.  Dent v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company, 406 F.2d 399 (5th Cir. 1969); Johnson v. Seaboard Air Line R.R. Co., 405 F.2d 645 (4th Cir. 1968), cert. denied sub nom.  Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc. v. Walker, 394 U.S. 918, 89 S.Ct. 1189, 22 L.Ed.2d 451 (1969); Choate v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 402 F.2d 357 (7th Cir. 1968), a case involving alleged discrimination in hiring on account of sex\\n        It should be added that on November 4, 1966, the EEOC issued the following regulation:\\n        1601.25a Processing of cases; when notice issues under 1601.25.\\n        (a) The time for processing all cases is extended to 60 days except insofar as proceedings may be earlier terminated pursuant to 1601.19.\\n        (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission shall not issue a notice pursuant to 1601.19 or, where a reasonable cause has been found, prior to efforts at conciliation with respondent, except that the charging party or the respondent may upon the expiration of 60 days after the filing of the charge or any time thereafter demand in writing that such notice issue, and the Commission shall promptly issue such notice to all parties.\\n        (c) Issuance of notice pursuant to 1601.25 does not terminate the Commission's jurisdiction of the proceeding, and the case shall continue to be processed.  29 C.F.R. 1601.25a.\\n        Whether this regulation can be construed in the context of Title VII to require actual conciliation efforts as a condition precedent to a court action, we need not decide.  As was the case with the initial complaint here, the Dent, Johnson and Choate cases all involved suits brought prior to November 1966.  In Dent, the court said:\\n        It may be that this (November 4, 1966) regulation will generally put an end to cases in the posture of that here decided.  406 F.2d at 403.\\n      \\n      \\n        12\\n         In explanation of this provision, appellee stated in its brief, p. 9, that this\\n        * * * does no more than allow a credit to female employees for their years of service prior to the date of the revision, May 1, 1967, because the minimum retirement age for women alone was raised by negotiations from 60 to 65 years of age.  As of May 1, 1967, no credit is allowed to female employees for service rendered after the date of the revision.  Since the minimum retirement age for male employees was not raised, the prior service credit for women was nothing other than a recognition by the defendant and the Union of an accrued contractual right for pension purposes, particularly in light of Article XVII of the labor agreement * * *\\n        which prohibits the company from 'diminish(ing) any of the benefits provided under said (pension) plan * * *'\\n      \\n      \\n        13\\n         According to appellants, this provision was also discriminatory in the following fashion:\\n        Thus, a female with thirty years' service, with an average salary of $10,000 per year, had pension credits of $3,000 per year, on May 1, 1967.  If she retired on May 1, 1968, at age 60, she would have had an additional one year's service or an additional $100 credit.  The $100 would be reduced by 1\/4 of 1% For twelve months, or a total of 3%, or $3, for a net of $97.  Her pension would therefore be $3,097 per year, as of May 1, 1968.\\n        On the other hand a male employee, who retired on May 1, 1968, under exactly the same circumstances, would receive an annual pension of $3,100 less 21%, or $651, for a net pension of $2,449.  (Appellants' brief, p. 5.)\\n        Putting it another way, appellants contended that:\\n        In 1968, a female may retire at age 60, on a pension reduced by approximately .01% (this should probably be .1%); a male's pension is reduced by 21%.  (Brief, p. 15.)\\n      \\n      \\n        14\\n         App. 114a, 115a\\n      \\n      \\n        15\\n         For reasons which are not entirely clear, the court below was not apprised by appellants that they had already filed further charges with the EEOC challenging the amended pension plan, and evidently appellee was also unaware of it at this time.  The new charge had actually been filed sometime in July or August, 1967.  On August 22, 1968, in accord with appellants' request (see EEOC brief, p. 3), the Commission notified appellants, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1601.25(b), that they had thirty days in which to institute suit\\n        On September 20, 1968, appellants filed a separate complaint in the district court, at Civil Docket No. 955-- 1968, alleging that the modified pension plan violated Title VII of the Act by discriminating on the basis of sex.  That suit is still pending.  According to this new complaint, a copy of which was supplied to this court, the EEOC has informed the parties that its investigation of the new charge would be 'suspended' pending the decision of this court in the instant appeal.\\n      \\n      \\n        16\\n         In their brief, p. 11, appellants argue strenuously that 'it is not necessary * * * to file new charges (with the EEOC) because subsequent pension plan modifications do not correct the fault which is the basis for the original charge.'\\n      \\n      \\n        17\\n         From EEOC's brief, p. 7\\n        The collective bargaining agreement evidently allows the appellee-company to make unilateral changes in the pension plan so long as such changes do not decrease the available benefits.  The Commission and appellants envisage the possibility of the company making step-by-step decreases in any alleged inequality between male and female employees each time suit is brought, following the filing of charges with the Commission and the Commission's inability to obtain voluntary compliance.  Appellee-company rejects this analysis of the collective bargaining agreement.  (Appellee's reply brief, p. 8.)\\n      \\n      \\n        18\\n         We rely on Jenkins only in support of the right to claim monetary damages for harm prior to the elimination of the discriminatory practice.  For the reasons subsequently given, we do not follow Jenkins as to its approval of injunctive relief\\n      \\n      \\n        19\\n         Because, as previously stated, a number of other members of the union filed charges of discrimination with the EEOC, which the Commission by agreement with appellee (App. 85a) consolidated with the prior charges for purposes of investigation, and because of the apparent right of the union to bring this action on behalf of its members, International Chemical Workers Union v. Planters Manufacturing Co., 259 F.Supp. 365 (N.D.Miss.1966), we believe that the court may consider possible harm not only to the named appellants but also to other members of the union.  In its decision of January 26, 1966, App. 13a, the EEOC said that the charge filed by the union was 'on behalf of all male employees as the aggrieved parties.'  Also, at pretrial conference, counsel for appellants stated 'that this involves really a class action that is representative of a tremendous number of people in the Public Service Company, all of whom are involved in this one particular pension plan.'  App. 65a\\n        It should be noted, however, that appellee asserted below that the 'suit is not a proper class action,' App. 68a, and that the union is not an aggrieved person under Title VII, App. 20a.  We do not decide the issue conclusively at this time but leave it for the initial determination of the district court if the matter is raised.  Cf. Oatis v.

Alexander, 294 F.Supp. 1100 (D.D.C.1968), for a discussion of the effect of an EEOC 'guideline'), the Commission's declaration is not dispositive of the question, and we have found no reported cases ruling directly on the issue.  Appellants rely by analogy on Inland Steel Co. v. NLRB, 170 F.2d 247, 12 A.L.R.2d 240 (7th Cir. 1948), cert. denied, 336 U.S. 960, 69 S.Ct. 887, 93 L.Ed. 1112 (1949), which held that the requirement in the National Labor Relations Act that employers bargain in respect 'to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment or other conditions of employment' covers pension plans.  (See also Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, 379 U.S. 203, 222, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233, 6 A.L.R.3d 1130 (1964); Retail Clerks Union v.

Title VII, which prohibits discrimination 'with respect to * * * compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, * * *' 42 U.S.C.A. 2000e-2(a)(1), is asserted by appellants' counsel actually to be broader in coverage than the National Labor Relations Act language.

We believe similar disposition is warranted here with respect to the discrimination charged in the initial complaint which has now been eliminated\\n      \\n      \\n        23\\n         We also deem it unnecessary therefore to determine whether, as appellants contend, the discrimination alleged in the modified pension plan was in fact a partial continuation of the discriminatory scheme of the original pension plan\\n      \\n      \\n        24\\n         In connection with the charge made in the amendment to the first complaint, and in the second complaint, that the modified pension plan violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the question may again arise as to whether the proper administrative procedures have been followed to permit the court to decide the issues raised on the merits.  While the appellee has stated it would not raise any 'jurisdictional' objections to the second suit (appellee's reply brief, p. 3; appellee's brief on motion to dismiss, appeal, p. 3), the district court has the right, of course, to raise the question of jurisdiction, in the broad sense of that term, sua sponte.  In view of the fact that appellants have filed a charge with the EEOC against the modified pension plan, and the EEOC pursuant to appellants' request has authorized the institution of a civil suit on this charge, supra note 15, the necessary prerequisites for court action appear to have been met according to the authorities cited in note 11, supra\\n      \\n      \\n        25\\n         We do not dispute the 'public policy overtones' in this case stressed in the dissent.  The applicability of Title VII to pension plans, particularly as related to the prohibition against discrimination on account of sex, will no doubt have to be determined in the second suit pending between the parties even if the original complaint is found to be moot.  Furthermore, if appellants prevail in the second suit, there may emerge a pattern of discrimination which could conceivably call for injunctive relief\\n        All we decide today is that on the record in this appeal the powerful remedy of injunction is not warranted to provide protection from the discriminatory practice, alleged in the original complaint, which has already been eliminated.  With respect to the second suit and the amendment to the frist complaint, which should no doubt be consolidated for trial, we believe (without completely foreclsoing the matter) that the issues are ripe for disposal on the merits.

First, the court was of the opinion that because the alleged unfair employment practice, discrimination in pension rights on the basis of sex, had been rectified by a collective bargaining agreement negotiated subsequent to proceedings before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the filing of the suit, the issues raised by the complaint had become moot. Secondly in dealing with an amendment to the appellants\u2019 complaint, which alleged that the appellee-company was still discriminating on account of sex in the pension arrangement under the new collective bargaining agreement, the court concluded that because the latter contention had never been the subject matter of a charge filed with the EEOC,2 the court lacked jurisdiction.3\\nThe appellants, Rosen, Sweeney and Utility Co-Workers Association, a certified bargaining representative for about 1,800 of the 15,000 employees of appellee, Public Service Electric and Gas Company, filed charges in 1965 4 with the EEOC alleging that appellee was committing an unlawful employment practice within the meaning of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by maintaining a pension plan that discriminated on the basis of sex because it permitted retirement at different ages and length of service for men and women.5\\nUnder the original pension plan male employees could retire at 65 with 25 years of service, with mandatory retirement at age 70. Female employees could retire at age 60 with 20 years\u2019 service and retirement was mandatory at age 65. *777The plan also provided for early retirement for male employees at the age of 60, but before attaining the age of 65, upon completion of 30 years of service. Male employees taking early retirement had their pension benefits reduced by a specified rate.6\\nAccording to appellants, a male employee taking early retirement at age 60, after 30 years\u2019 service, would receive a substantially lower pension than a female employee retiring at the same age, with the same length of service, assuming the same average annual salary.7\\nAfter the charges were filed with the EEOC, and following an investigation, the Commission issued a decision, dated January 26, 1966, finding reasonable cause to believe that the pension plan violated Title VII.8 By letter dated February 9,1966, the Director of Compliance of the EEOC informed appellant Rosen that such reasonable cause had been found, and that the Commission would attempt to eliminate the practice by conciliation.9 By another letter, also dated February 9, 1966, Mr. Rosen was advised by the Director of Compliance that due to the heavy workload of the Commission, it had not been possible to undertake or to conclude the conciliation efforts, but that conciliation would be undertaken and continued.10\\n*778Mr. Rosen was further notified that under Section 706(e) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he had the right to bring suit in the district court within thirty days after the receipt of the letter. Suit was instituted on March 9, 1966, with Rosen, Sweeney and the union named as plaintiffs.11\\nDuring the pendency of the suit, the union and the appellee-company negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement effective May 1, 1967, which, inter alia, modified the pension plan by erasing the differences in the optional and mandatory retirement ages for men and women, thus apparently eliminating the predicate of appellants\u2019 initial complaint. All employees were permitted to retire at 65, with compulsory retirement at 70.\\nThe modified pension plan also provided for early retirement for all employees at age 60, on a reduced pension, after 20 years of service. Female employees electing early retirement would not suffer any reduction in benefits on account of service prior to May 1, 1967.12 *779No similar provision was made for male employees electing early retirement.13\\nFollowing the adoption of the new collective bargaining agreement, the district court, on December 21,1967, orally granted leave to appellants at pretrial conference \u201cto file an amended\u201d complaint to allege that the modified pension plan also violated Title VII of the Act. (App. 64a).\\nWhile we cannot find in the record that an amendment to the original complaint, or an amended complaint, was actually filed, the parties and the court proceeded in the action further as if amendment had been accomplished. For example, in its motion for summary judgment, appellee lists as one of its grounds:\\n3. The revised negotiated Pension Plan does not discriminate within the purview of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (Emphasis added). (App. 68a).\\nLikewise, in its briefs to this court, appellee refers to the \u201coral amendment\u201d of the complaint at the pretrial conference. (Main brief, p. 2; reply brief, p. 2.).\\nIn the oral opinion rendered by the court below, the judge stated:\\nI consider that I am without jurisdiction at this particular time to grant the relief sought by way of the amendments to the pleadings set forth in the pretrial order [sic], (Emphasis added). (App. 110a).\\nThus in our disposition of this appeal we will treat the complaint as if an amendment had been filed.\\nOn March 19, 1968, the district court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.14 The court was of the opinion that the modification of the pension plan rendered the original complaint moot. Summary judgment was granted as to the amendment to the complaint on the ground that no charges had been filed with the EEOC alleging that the modified pension plan constituted an unfair employment practice ;15 hence, the administrative remedies under the 1964 Act had not been exhausted.16\\n*780On this appeal the appellants and the EEOC, appearing as amicus curiae, contend that the original complaint was not mooted by the May 1, 1967, revision in the pension plan because of the possibility that some employees may have suffered money damages before the change was made, and because the district court had failed to determine whether injunctive relief was necessary to protect the public interest against the alleged continuing discrimination by appellee on the basis of sex. The EEOC argues that the policy expressed in Title VII will be frustrated if parties-defendant in a Title VII proceeding are permitted \u201cto place plaintiffs on an administrative treadmill by compelling litigants to go back to the Commission every time there is an alleged change in a discriminatory practice.\u201d 17\\nWe find merit in the first part of appellants\u2019 argument, i. e., the possibility of some of the employees of the appellee-company having suffered harm before the May 1, 1967 pension plan modification. See Jenkins v. United Gas Corp., 400 F.2d 28 (5th Cir. 1968).18 Accordingly, insofar as the original complaint is concerned, the case will be remanded for a determination as to whether any of the named appellants, and any other male members of the union,19 may have retired between the date of the initial 1965 charges before the EEOC and the May 1, 1967 change, and thus may have been harmed by the alleged discrimination in the pension benefit formula.20 Such a finding, of course, would require the court to rule on whether the original pension plan, *781prior to its modification, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.21\\nIf the district court does not find any party entitled to the kind of relief above described for harm caused by alleged discrimination prior to the May 1, 1967 pension plan revision, then we agree with the appellee that the issues raised in the original complaint are moot. We recognize that the complaint specifically requested injunctive relief, and we have studied carefully the position of the EEOC that the strong policy behind the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would normally support the grant of an injunction to make certain that an employer who has voluntarily stopped discriminatory practices continues to hew to the proper course.\\nAs the appellee points out, and as is implicit in the eases upon which the EEOC relies, e. g., Jenkins v. United Gas Corp., supra, this kind of injunctive relief is particularly appropriate in the sensitive area of racial discrimination where the Commission and the courts should make sure that once the formal proceedings have ended the ugly face of bias does not reappear. But this is not such a case. We do not make the distinction on the basis that discrimination on account of sex is any less reprehensible or any less protected than discrimination because of race. We make the distinction because here we have a written modification of a pension plan, embodied in a collective bargaining agreement, which excised the age differentials in retirement between men and women to which the original complaint was addressed. We conclude, therefore, that if no male employee was harmed by the pre-May 1967 pension plan, that should dispose of the original complaint and injunctive relief is unnecessary.22\\n*782Turning now to the amendment to the original com plaint which alleged continuing discrimination under the modified pension plan, we have already noted that a second suit has been filed duplicating the charge that the modified plan violates Title VII. Because this second suit has not yet been disposed of, and because it deals with precisely the same substantive issues as the amendment to the original complaint, we deem it unnecessary to determine whether the grant of summary judgment as to that portion of the first complaint was in error.23 It was suggested at oral argument that consolidation of the two actions, i. e., the original complaint as amended and the second complaint, would be sought if this court directed a remand. We believe that this would be the proper procedure to follow and that upon such consolidation the issues involved in the initial complaint, the amendment thereto, and the second complaint, can be sifted out and disposition made of them.24\\nAs a matter of form, one other issue must be dealt with. Appellee moved to dismiss the appeal, and argument on the motion was heard at the time of the hearing on the merits. The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.\\nThe judgment of the district court will be vacated and the case will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.25\\n\\n. Section 703(a) (1), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-2.\\n\\n\\n. As will appear later, a charge against the revised pension plan had in fact been filed with the EE.OC, but had not been called to the attention of the court prior to its decision. However, authority to file suit on this later charge had not been officially granted by the EEOC prior to the date of the amendment of the complaint or the lower court\u2019s decision. See note 15, infra.\\n\\n\\n. Section 706(e), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-5(e). For the conditions precedent to the filing of a civil action, see note 11, infra.\\n\\n\\n. After the initial court suit was instituted in 1966 about 35 other employees filed charges with the EEOC. The additional charges were consolidated by the Commission with those filed in 1965. Appendix (App.) 80a-85a.\\n\\n\\n. Discrimination was also claimed in a job assignment provision of the collective bargaining agreement between the parties which provided that,\\nIf a male employee who is 60 years of age or over, or a female employee who is 55 years of age or over, is assigned to a lower classification not for incapacity, but because of the elimination of his [sic] job, his existing rate shall not be lowered by virtue of the assignment to a lower-rated job.\\nThis provision was eliminated in the May 1, 1967 revision of the collective bargaining agreement, App. 60a, and appears to be no longer in issue.\\n\\n\\n. The relevant sections of the pension plan (established in 1911 according to appellee and in effect up to the time of the May 1, 1967 revision), which formed the basis of the initial complaint, were as follows:\\nSection 3. Each male employee may at his option retire at age sixty-five or thereafter upon completion of twenty-five years of service, and must retire at age seventy. Each female employee may at her option retire at age sixty or thereafter upon completion of twenty years of service, and must retire at age sixty-five.\\nSection 4. Each employee who retires under the provisions of this Pension Plan relating to normal retirement for age shall be paid for life, in monthly installments, a pension computed at the annual rate of 1% of the average annual wage or salary of such employee for the five years of highest earnings within the last ten years of the employee\u2019s service, multiplied by the number of years, and any fraction of a year, of the employee\u2019s service.\\nSection 5. Each male employee may at his option retire at age sixty or thereafter but before attainment of age sixty-five upon completion of thirty years of service.\\nSection 6. Each male employee who retires under the provisions of this Pension Plan relating to early retirement shall be paid for life, in monthly installments, a pension computed at the annual rate of 1% of the average annual wage or salary of such employee for the five years of highest earnings within the last ten years of the employee\u2019s service, multiplied by the number of years, and any fraction of a year, of the employee\u2019s service, [and reduced by one-half of 1% for each month that such employee is less than age sixty-five at the time of his retirement.] (App. 2a.)\\nThe bracketed portion of Section 6 was modified prior to the filing of the initial suit to provide that,\\nAn employee who becomes eligible for early retirement under the present early retirement provisions of the Pension Plan and is sixty-two years old but less than age sixty-five will have his pension reduced by one-quarter of 1% for each month that he is less thgn age sixty-five at the time of retirement. The present reduction is one-half of 1% per month for this span of years.\\nAn employee eligible for early retirement under present provisions who is sixty years old but less than age sixty-two will have his pension reduced by one-quarter of 1% for each of the thirty-six months below age sixty-five and one-lialf of 1% for each month that he is below age sixty-two at the time of retirement. (App. 56a.)\\n\\n\\n. Appellants\u2019 brief, p. 3.\\n\\n\\n. App. 13a. While the discrimination found was generally against male employees, the Commission also said that,\\nFemale employees are disadvantaged by the discriminatory operation of the pension plan in that it is compulsory that they retire at age 65 even though some female employees who may be able and physically desirous of working five additional years would not be permitted to do so, * * *\\nIt should be noted that appellant-union represents both male and female employees.\\n\\n\\n. App. 11a.\\n\\n\\n. App. 12a.\\n\\n\\n. There is conflicting evidence in the record as to whether conciliation efforts had been undertaken before the EEOC\u2019s letter authorizing suit was sent and before and after suit was filed. (App. 49a, 50a, 69a, 71a, 76a-79a.) In view of recent decisions in a number of circuits, it appears that, at least as of the time this suit was initially brought, actual efforts at conciliation by the EEOC were not a prerequisite to the filing of a civil action under Title VII so long as a charge had been filed with the Commission and the statutory notice had been received from the EEOC that it had been unabl\u00a7 to obtain voluntary compliance. Dent v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company, 406 F.2d 399 (5th Cir. 1969); Johnson v. Seaboard Air Line R.R. Co., 405 F.2d 645 (4th Cir. 1968), cert. denied sub nom. Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc. v. Walker, 394 U.S. 918, 89 S.Ct. 1189, 22 L.Ed.2d 451 (1969); Choate v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 402 F.2d 357 (7th Cir. 1968), a case involving alleged discrimination in hiring on account of sex.\\nIt should be added that on November 4, 1966, the EEOC issued the following regulation:\\n\u00a7 1601.25a Processing of cases; when notice issues under \u00a7 1601.25.\\n(a) The time for processing all cases is extended to 60 days except insofar as proceedings may be earlier terminated pursuant to \u00a7 1601.19.\\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission shall not issue a notice pursuant to \u00a7 1601.19 or, where a reasonable cause has been found, prior to efforts at conciliation with respondent, except that the charging party or the respondent may upon the expiration of 60 days after the filing of the charge or any time thereafter demand in writing that such notice issue, and the Commission shall promptly issue such notice to all parties.\\n(c) Issuance of notice pursuant to \u00a7 1601.25 does not terminate the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction of the proceeding, and the case shall continue to be processed. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.25a.\\nWhether this regulation can be construed in the context of Title VII to require actual conciliation efforts as a condition precedent to a court action, we need not decide. As was the case with the initial complaint here, the Dent, Johnson and Choate cases all involved suits brought prior to November 1966. In Dent, the court said :\\nIt may be that this [November 4, 1966] regulation will generally put an end to cases in the posture of that here decided. 406 F.2d at 403.\\n\\n\\n. In explanation of this provision, appellee stated in its brief, p. 9, that this\\n* * * does no more than allow a credit to female employees for their years of service prior to the date of the revision, May 1, 1967, because the minimum retirement age for women alone was raised by negotiations from 60 to 65 years of age. As of May 1, 1967, no credit is allowed to female employees for service rendered after the date of the revision. Since the minimum retirement age for male employees was not raised, the prior service credit for women was nothing other than a recognition by the defendant and the Union of an accrued contractual right for pension purposes, particularly in light of Article XVII of the labor agreement * * *\\nwhich prohibits the company from \u201cdiminish[ing] any of the benefits provided under said [pension] plan * * * \u201d\\n\\n\\n. According to appellants, this provision was also discriminatory in the following fashion:\\nThus, a female with thirty years\u2019 service, with an average salary of $10,000 per year, had pension credits of $3,000 per year, on May 1, 1967. If she retired on May 1, 1968, at age 60, she would have had an additional one year\u2019s service or an additional $100 credit. The $100 would be reduced by 14 of 1% for twelve months, or a total of 3%, or $3, for a net of $97. Her pension would therefore be $3,097 per year, as of May 1,1968.\\nOn the other hand a male employee, who retired on May 1, 1968, under exactly the same circumstances, would receive an annual pension of $3,100 less 21%, or $651, for a net pension of $2,449. (Appellants\u2019 brief, p. 5.)\\nPutting it another way, appellants contended that:\\nIn 1968, a female may retire at age 60, on a pension reduced by approximately .01% [this should probably be .1%] ; a male\u2019s pension is reduced by 21%. (Brief, p. 15.)\\n\\n\\n. App. 114a, 115a.\\n\\n\\n. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the court below was not apprised by appellants that they had already filed further charges with the EEOC challenging the amended pension plan, and evidently appellee was also unaware of it at this time. The new charge had actually been filed sometime in July or August, 1967. On August 22, 1968, in accord with appellants\u2019 request (see EEOC brief, p. 3), the Commission notified appellants, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.25 (b), that they had thirty days in which to institute suit.\\nOn September 20, 1968, appellants filed a separate complaint in the district court, at Civil Docket No. 955 \u2014 1968, alleging that the modified pension plan violated Title VII of the Act by discriminating on the basis of sex. That suit is still pending. According to this new complaint, a copy of which was supplied to this court, the EEOC has informed the parties that its investigation of the new charge would be \u201csuspended\u201d pending the decision of this court in the instant appeal.\\n\\n\\n. In their brief, p. 11, appellants argue strenuously that \u201cit is not necessary * * * to file new charges [with the EEOC] because subsequent pension plan modifications do not correct the fault which is the basis for the original charge.\u201d\\n\\n\\n. From EEOC\u2019s brief, p. 7.\\nThe collective bargaining agreement evidently allows the appellee-company to make unilateral changes in the pension plan so long as such changes do not decrease the available benefits. The Commission and appellants envisage the possibility of the company making step-by-step decreases in any alleged inequality between male and female employees each time suit is brought, following the filing of charges with the Commission and the Commission\u2019s inability to obtain voluntary compliance. Appellee-company rejects this analysis of the collective bargaining agreement. (Appellee\u2019s reply brief, p. 8.)\\n\\n\\n. We rely on Jenhins only in support of the right to claim monetary damages for harm prior to the elimination of the discriminatory practice. For the reasons subsequently given, we do not follow Jenhins as to its approval of injunctive relief.\\n\\n\\n. Because, as previously stated, a number of other members of the union filed charges of discrimination with the EEOC, which the Commission by agreement with appellee (App. 85a) consolidated with the prior charges for purposes of investigation, and because of the apparent right of the union to bring this action on behalf of its members, International Chemical Workers Union v. Planters Manufacturing Co., 259 F.Supp. 365 (N.D.Miss. 1966), we believe that the court may consider possible harm not only to the named appellants but also to other members of the union. In its decision of January 26, 1966, App. 13a, the EEOC said that the charge filed by the union was \u201con behalf of all male employees as the aggrieved parties.\u201d Also, at pretrial conference, counsel for appellants stated \u201cthat this involves really a class action that is representative of a tremendous number of people in the Public Service Company, all of whom are involved in this one particular pension plan.\u201d App. 65a.\\nIt should be noted, however, that appellee asserted below that the \u201csuit is not a proper class action,\u201d App. 68a, and that the union is not an aggrieved person under Title VII, App. 20a. We do not decide the issue conclusively at this time but leave it for the initial determination of the district court if the matter is raised. Cf. Oatis v. Crown Zellerbach Corp., 398 F.2d 496 (5th Cir. 1968).\\n\\n\\n. The original complaint filed by appellants sufficiently contemplates possible monetary damages as the prayer in each of the three causes of action set forth asks \u201cfor such other and further relief as may be deemed just and proper by the court.\u201d We recognize appellants did not press this point below as they denied the case was moot. This does not prevent consideration of damages on remand.\\n\\n\\n. Appellee contended below that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not apply to retirement and pension plans.\\nIn February, 1968, the EEOC issued a \u201cStatement of Guidelines\u201d on this subject:\\n\\nSec. 1604-31 Pension and Retirement Plans\\n\\n(a) A difference in optional or compulsory retirement ages based on sex violates Title VII.\\n(b) Other differences based on sex, such as differences in benefits for survivors, will be decided by the Commission by the issuance of Commission decisions in cases raising such issues. Because the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 1003) requiring notice of proposed rule making, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable to these interpretative rules they shall become effective immediately and shall be applicable with respect to charges presently before or hereafter filed with the Commission, except that Section 1604.31(a) will become effective July 1, 1968, with respect to charges hereafter filed with the Commission.\\nWhile entitled to due weight (see American Newspaper Publishers Ass\u2019n v. Alexander, 294 F.Supp. 1100 (D.D.C.1968), for a discussion of the effect of an EEOC \u201cguideline\u201d), the Commission\u2019s declaration is not dispositive of the question, and we have found no reported cases ruling directly on the issue. Appellants rely by analogy on Inland Steel Co. v. NLRB, 170 F.2d 247, 12 A.L.R.2d 240 (7th Cir. 1948), cert. denied, 336 U.S. 960, 69 S.Ct. 887, 93 L.Ed. 1112 (1949), which held that the requirement in the National Labor Relations Act that employers bargain in respect \u201cto rates of pay, wages, hours of employment or other conditions of employment\u201d covers pension plans. (See also Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, 379 U.S. 203, 222, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233, 6 A.L.R.3d 1130 (1964); Retail Clerks Union v. NLRB, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 191, 330 F.2d 210, 215, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 828, 85 S.Ct. 41, 13 L.Ed.2d 31 (1964); and Annot. 12 A.L.R.2d 265, 274 (1950).) Title VII, which prohibits discrimination \u201cwith respect to * * * compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, * * *\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) (1), is asserted by appellants\u2019 counsel actually to be broader in coverage than the National Labor Relations Act language. (App. 96a.)\\nCf., Gruenwald v. Gardner, 390 F.2d 591 (2d Cir. 1968), unsuccessfully challenging inequalities in social security benefits based on sex, which did not, however, involve the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\\n\\n\\n. In Independent News Co. v. Williams, 404 F.2d 758 (3d Cir. 1968), we upheld the denial of an injunction \u201cagainst a practice which has already been stopped\u201d *782where there was a \u201creasonable inference\u201d the practice would not be resumed. 404 F.2d at 761. We believe similar disposition is warranted here with respect to the discrimination charged in the initial complaint which has now been eliminated.\\n\\n\\n. We also deem it unnecessary therefore to determine whether, as appellants contend, the discrimination alleged in the modified pension plan was in fact a partial continuation of the discriminatory scheme of the original pension plan.\\n\\n\\n. In connection with the charge made in the amendment to the first complaint, and in the second complaint, that the modified pension plan violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the question may again arise as to whether the proper administrative procedures have been followed to permit the court to decide the issues raised on the merits. While the appellee has stated it would not raise any \u201cjurisdictional\u201d objections to the second suit (appellee\u2019s reply brief, p. 3; appellee\u2019s brief on motion to dismiss, appeal, p. 3), the district court has the right, of course, to raise the question of jurisdiction, in the broad sense of that term, sua sponte. In view of the fact that appellants have filed a charge with the EEOC against the modified pension plan, and the EEOC pursuant to appellants\u2019 request has authorized the institution of a civil suit on this charge, supra note 15, the necessary prerequisites for court action appear to have been met according to the authorities cited in note 11, supra.\\n\\n\\n. We do not dispute the \u201cpublic policy overtones\u201d in this case stressed in the dissent. The applicability of Title VII to pension plans, particularly as related to the prohibition against discrimination on account of sex, will no doubt have to be determined in the second suit pending between the parties even if the original complaint is found to be moot. Furthermore, if appellants prevail in the second suit, there may emerge a pattern of discrimination which could conceivably call for injunctive relief.\\nAll we decide today is that on the record in this appeal the powerful remedy of injunction is not warranted to provide protection from the discriminatory practice, alleged in the original complaint, which has already been eliminated. With respect to the second suit and the amendment to the first complaint, which should no doubt be consolidated for trial, we believe (without completely foreclosing the matter) that the issues are ripe for disposal on the merits. See note 24 supra.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 9454470}, {'author_str': 'Seitz', 'per_curiam': False, 'type': '040dissent', 'page_count': None, 'download_url': None, 'author_id': None, 'opinion_text': '\\nSEITZ, Circuit Judge\\n(dissenting).\\nThe original complaint filed in this action on March 9, 1966, was based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It explicitly sought declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the defendant\u2019s then pension plan. The gravamen of the complaint was that the plan violated the Act because it discriminated in several respects in favor of female employees and in others, in favor of male employees. After the action was commenced, the defendant company revised the plan. Thereafter the plaintiffs *783amended their complaint1 to challenge the plan as revised and to assert a class action. Still later defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on several grounds. In amending their complaint plaintiffs made it clear that they were not withdrawing the original complaint, even though they conceded that the bulk of the specific grievances alleged may have been rectified by the adoption of the revised plan.\\nThe district court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Apparently the district court believed that the subject matter of the original complaint had been rendered moot by the revision of the pension plan and that only the amended complaint was before it. The amended complaint was dismissed on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction over its subject matter, because plaintiffs had not complied with the procedural requirements of the Act by first requesting relief from the EEOC.\\nAs I understand the majority opinion, the court is remanding the subject matter of the original complaint to the district court to have it determined if there are any employees, apparently treated as a class, who were injured by the alleged violation of the Act in the period prior to the modification of the plan. If not, then presumably under the majority decision, the district court properly viewed the original complaint as moot. If so, then the majority would direct the district court to decide whether plaintiffs have otherwise stated a legally cognizable claim. Although I agree with the majority that there should be a remand, I think their remand is too restrictive.\\nBy their original complaint the plaintiffs sought, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the plan violated the Act. The defendant raised many defenses, in-eluding the contention that Title VII of the Act did not apply to pension retirement plans. I think plaintiffs were entitled to have a declaration as to whether Title VII was applicable to the plan and, if so, whether the plan violated the Act. The revision of the plan did not render these important issues moot; the parties were still very much concerned with their resolution. Indeed, the issue of the applicability of Title VII was reasserted by the defendant after the plaintiffs amended the complaint. Moreover, it was a particularly appropriate subject for a declaratory judgment in view of the public policy overtones involved.2\\nPlaintiffs also sought injunctive relief. Were the district court to decide that Title VII applies to pension plans and that the revised plan was in violation of the Act then the court would be obliged to consider the need for an injunction. Contrary to the majority\u2019s approach, I think that it is premature to consider the propriety of injunctive relief in view of the fact that the question was not presented or decided below, and because the basis for such a determination has not been developed.\\nI next consider the dismissal of the amendment to the complaint by the district court on the ground that plaintiffs had not exhausted their remedies before the Commission as was said to be required by the Act. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-5(e). The majority decided that this issue need not be resolved. I am forced to disagree.\\nPreliminarily, although the district court posed the issue in terms of its jurisdiction, it had jurisdiction and the issue is whether the statutory prerequisite had been satisfied.\\nConsidering the discrimination charged in the amendement with that in the original complaint,3 I conclude that *784the subject matter is so interrelated that the Act does not require plaintiffs to again petition the Commission in order that the district court might properly consider the amendment. A purpose for first proceeding before the Commission in this type of case is to permit an amicable settlement without litigation. When grievances are obviously independent, that statutory purpose is best served by first resorting to conciliation -before the EEOC. However, and as the EEOC urges, where, as here, the basic grievance had been \u201cprocessed\u201d by the Commission and litigation recommended, no statutory purpose is served by forcing further conciliation efforts. I therefore believe that it was error to grant summary judgment on the ground relied upon by the district court.\\n\\n. I agree with the majority\u2019s decision to treat the complaint as if an amendment had been filed.\\n\\n\\n. Compare Wirtz v. Local 153, Glass Bottle Blowers, 389 U.S. 463, 88 S.Ct. 643, 19 L.Ed.2d 705 (1968).\\n\\n\\n. In substance both the original and the amended complaints charge unlawful discrimination because women employees, when electing early retirement, are treated more favorably than their male counterparts.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 9454471}]"},{"id":784874,"date_filed":"2004-01-23","judges":null,"case_name_full":"Tina M.

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge.\\n    \\n    \\n      1\\n      This appeal from the dismissal of a Title VII suit alleging racial discrimination in employment endeavors to assert a right of \"interracial association\" &#8212; the right of employees to enjoy association in the workplace with other employees selected without racial discrimination. The appeal is from the February 5, 2003, judgment of the District Court for the Western District of New York (William M. Skretny, District Judge), dismissing a suit brought by seven current or former African-American employees (\"Appellants\" or \"Plaintiffs\") against their employer, Occidental Chemical Corp. (\"Occidental\"). Judge Skretny dismissed the suit on motion for summary judgment, ruling that the Plaintiffs had not presented a prima facie case of a discriminatory hiring policy against job applicants, which the Plaintiffs alleged had resulted in the lack of a racially diverse workplace. Without assessing the correctness of that ruling, we conclude that, even if a right of interracial association in the workplace is cognizable under Title VII, the Plaintiffs cannot prevail for lack of any evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they have been denied such association. We therefore affirm.\\n    \\n    Background\\n    \\n      2\\n      The Appellants, who are African-Americans, are or were employees of Occidental at its Niagara Falls, N.Y., facility. They brought suit against Occidental seeking injunctive relief, a declaratory judgment, and money damages for various alleged violations of federal and state anti-discrimination laws. They primarily alleged discrete acts of race and sex discrimination against themselves and a hostile work environment. In response to the Defendants\\' motion for summary judgment, the Plaintiffs conceded, both in reply papers and oral argument, that their claims for discrete acts of discrimination and hostile work environment could not survive summary judgment under National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002), and other recent developments in employment discrimination case law. However, the Plaintiffs sought to resist summary judgment on their one remaining claim that Occidental\\'s discriminatory hiring policy had deprived the Plaintiffs of the benefits of interracial association in the workplace, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e et seq. (2000). In an order entered on February 5, 2003, the District Court disagreed. Judge Skretny ruled that the Plaintiffs had not presented a prima facie case of a discriminatory hiring policy against job applicants and did not reach the issue of whether the existence of such a policy would support a claim by the Plaintiffs for denial of a right of interracial association in the workplace. Because we resolve this appeal without consideration of whether the Plaintiffs have presented a prima facie case of a discriminatory hiring policy, we need not detail the Plaintiffs\\' allegations concerning Occidental\\'s hiring policy.\\n    \\n    Discussion\\n    \\n      3\\n      We may affirm on any ground with support in the record, even if it was not the ground relied on by the District Court. See Headley v. Tilghman, 53 F.3d 472, 476 (2d Cir.1995) (citing Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238, 245, 58 S.Ct. 154, 82 L.Ed. 224 (1937)). Accordingly, although the District Court rejected the Plaintiffs\\' interracial association claim for lack of evidence of a prima facie case that Occidental had rejected African-American applicants on a discriminatory basis, we will consider the viability of the interracial association claim without regard to whether potential co-workers were rejected on grounds that would have given such applicants valid Title VII claims.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Assertion of a denial of a right of interracial association has two components. Initially, the plaintiff makes a third-party claim that persons with whom he or she would like to associate have been excluded from the relevant context on the basis of racial discrimination. In addition, the plaintiff makes a first-party claim of denial of the benefits of associating, in a relevant context, with those who would have been included in the relevant context had they not been excluded because of a racially discriminatory selection process.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      The Supreme Court first recognized the viability of a claim for denial of interracial association in Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 409 U.S. 205, 93 S.Ct. 364, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972). The relevant context was housing, specifically an apartment complex housing about 8,200 residents. See id. at 206, 93 S.Ct. 364. The plaintiffs, residents of the complex, alleged that the owner of the complex had discriminated on the basis of race against prospective tenants in the rental of apartments in violation of section 810(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3610(a). See id. at 206-07, 93 S.Ct. 364. The plaintiffs then alleged that this discrimination against potential tenants had caused them three specific injuries: (1) loss of the social benefits of living in an integrated community, (2) loss of business and professional advantages that would have developed from living with members of minority groups, and (3) embarrassment and economic damage from the stigma of living in what was characterized as a \"white ghetto.\" See id. at 208, 93 S.Ct. 364.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Relying on the broad definition of \"person aggrieved\" in section 810(a), the Supreme Court accorded the plaintiffs standing to pursue their claims for \"loss of important benefits from interracial associations,\" id. at 210, 93 S.Ct. 364, thereby implicitly permitting them to assert third-party claims of racial discrimination on behalf of potential tenants. Three Justices concurred specifically on the ground that the statute accorded standing that would have been doubtful under Article III in the absence of the statute. See id. at 212, 93 S.Ct. 364 (White, J., with whom Blackmun and Powell, JJ., join, concurring).\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      Several circuits have applied Trafficante to the workplace context, ruling that Title VII\\'s phrase \"person claiming to be aggrieved,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e-5, allows \"third-party\" standing to the fullest extent permitted by Article III\\'s case or controversy requirement. See, e.g., Anjelino v. New York Times Co., 200 F.3d 73, 90, 91 &amp; n. 25 (3d Cir.1999); EEOC v. Mississippi College, 626 F.2d 477, 481-83 (5th Cir. 1980) (cited in Leibovitz v. New York City Transit Authority, 252 F.3d 179, 186 n. 5 (2d Cir.2001)); Waters v. Heublein, Inc., 547 F.2d 466, 469 (9th Cir.1976); Gray v. Greyhound Lines, East, 545 F.2d 169, 175-76 (D.C.Cir.1976).\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Our Court has not had occasion to decide whether Trafficante\\'s allowance of so-called third-party standing is applicable to a claim of denial of a right of interracial association in the workplace in violation of Title VII. Occidental contends that we expressly rejected interracial association claims in Ad Hoc Committee of Concerned Teachers v. Greenburgh # 11 Union Free School District, 873 F.2d 25, 28 (2d Cir. 1989) (\"Greenburgh\"). Greenburgh does not resolve the issue in the Title VII context, however, because the associational claims in that case were grounded on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, rather than a statute like Title VII. The Supreme Court has explicitly distinguished Constitution-based claims like those in Greenburgh from those with a statutory basis. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 513-14, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). \"Congress may create a statutory right or entitlement the alleged deprivation of which can confer standing to sue even where the plaintiff would have suffered no judicially cognizable injury in the absence of statute.\" Id. at 514, 95 S.Ct. 2197. \"[T]he critical distinction between Trafficante and the situation [in Warth]\" was that the plaintiff organization in Warth did \"not assert on behalf of its members any right of action under the 1968 Civil Rights Act.\" Id. at 513. Warth confirms the concerns expressed by the concurring Justices in Trafficante. The pending case does not require us to decide whether Trafficante applies to a Title VII claim of denial of interracial association in the workplace because, in opposing the motion for summary judgment, the Plaintiffs failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the denial they alleged had occurred. They produced no data concerning the number of minority employees in Occidental\\'s workforce or in the immediate area where they worked, thereby precluding any basis for determining whether their opportunity for interracial association was unduly limited. Moreover, unlike the tenants in Trafficante, the Plaintiffs presented no evidence that they were deprived of any benefits of interracial association or otherwise actually injured. Cf. Greenburgh, 873 F.2d at 28. This total failure of proof abundantly justified summary judgment for Occidental.\\n    \\n    Conclusion\\n    \\n      9\\n      The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 784874}]"},{"id":774477,"date_filed":"2001-08-13","judges":"Graber, Hill, McKEOWN","case_name_full":"EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.

Margaret McKeown, Circuit Judges.\\n    \\n    McKEOWN, Circuit Judge\\n    \\n      1\\n      This case raises issues at the intersection of administrative, Indian, and anti-discrimination law. We must decide whether the district court properly enforced an administrative subpoena issued to an Indian tribe in connection with an age-discrimination investigation. Robert Grant, a member of the Karuk Tribe (\"the Tribe\") and an employee of the Karuk Tribe Housing Authority (the \"Housing Authority\"), filed an administrative complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \"EEOC\"), alleging that he had been terminated because of his age. The EEOC opened an investigation and issued a subpoena to the Tribe, which refused to comply on the grounds that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 621-34 (the\"ADEA\"), does not apply to Indian tribes, and that the Tribe enjoys sovereign immunity from the EEOC investigation.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      The EEOC sought judicial enforcement of the subpoena. The district court issued an order enforcing the subpoena, from which the Tribe now appeals. We reverse.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      The threshold question is whether the Tribe is immune from suit. We conclude that it is not. We next address whether the Tribe is subject to the ADEA in these circumstances. We conclude that it is not. Resolution of this issue is a pure question of law that is currently ripe for review and, therefore, is best resolved at the subpoena-enforcement stage, rather than in potential downstream litigation. To hold otherwise would frustrate the regulatory scheme, ignore the special status of the Tribe, and subject the Tribe to an unnecessary compliance burden. Thus, because the ADEA does not apply to the Tribe\\'s employment relationship with Grant, we conclude that the Tribe need not comply with the subpoena.\\n    \\n    BACKGROUND\\n    \\n      4\\n      The Karuk Tribe Housing Authority owns 100 low-income housing units on tribal trust land in Northern California. The Tribe does not have its own reservation but instead occupies land held in trust by the United States. The Housing Authority, organized and authorized through a tribal ordinance, is a governmental arm of the Tribe. The Housing Authority, which provides safe and affordable housing to members of the Tribe, receives funding under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, 25 U.S.C.&#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 4101-12. This legislation, passed in 1996, was particularly concerned with \"the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance.\" Id. &#167;&#167; 4101(7). Although there is no formal requirement that only Tribe members may occupy the units, according to the Vice-Chairman of the Karuk Tribe and Acting Executive Director of the Karuk Tribe Housing Authority, ninety-nine of the units are occupied by Indian families. The record does not reveal how many of the Indians who occupy the units are members of the Tribe. According to the district court\\'s order enforcing the subpoena, the Housing Authority employed twenty Indians and four non-Indians.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Grant, an enrolled member of the Tribe, worked as a maintenance supervisor for the Housing Authority for almost seven years, until he was terminated in November 1997. He was fifty-three years old at the time of his termination. Grant challenged his firing in internal tribal administrative proceedings, which are governed by written policies and procedures. After a hearing, the Board of Commissioners upheld the Housing Authority\\'s actions. Grant further appealed to the Tribal Council, the highest governing body of the Tribe, which rejected his claim as well.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      In February 1998, Grant filed a \"Charge of Discrimination\" with the EEOC on a standard form, alleging that he had been terminated because of his age.2 The EEOC subsequently opened an investigation based on its purported authority under 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 626(a). Section 626(a) provides,\"The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall have the power to make investigations and require the keeping of records necessary or appropriate for the administration of this chapter in accordance with the powers and procedures provided in sections 209 and 211 of this title.\" Section 211(a), which is relevant here, provides,\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      The Administrator or his designated representatives may investigate and gather data regarding the wages, hours, and other conditions and practices of employment in any industry subject to this chapter, and may enter and inspect such places and such records (and make such transcriptions thereof), question such employees, and investigate such facts, conditions, practices, or matters as he may deem necessary or appropriate to determine whether any person has violated any provision of this chapter, or which may aid in the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      The EEOC served on the Tribe a copy of the charge, along with a request for a written position statement and a list of questions. The Tribe responded that it would not provide the information, based on its position that the ADEA does not apply to Indian tribes. In March 1999, the EEOC served on the Housing Authority\\'s custodian of records an administrative subpoena seeking various employment records. The Tribe responded with a letter explaining that it would not provide the requested information, again based on its view that the EEOC does not have jurisdiction over Indian tribes.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      The EEOC filed an application to enforce the administrative subpoena in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The district court held that \"the EEOC has jurisdiction over Indian tribes for the purpose of enforcing the ADEA,\" granted the EEOC\\'s application, and issued an enforcement order. The Tribe timely appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1291, and we reverse.\\n    \\n    DISCUSSION\\n    I. TRIBAL SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY\\n    \\n      10\\n      As a threshold matter, we first address the Tribe\\'s contention that it enjoys sovereign immunity from the EEOC\\'s inquiry and thus from this lawsuit. It is true that Indian tribes do, as a general rule, enjoy sovereign immunity from private lawsuits. Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 58 (1978). Indian tribes do not, however, enjoy sovereign immunity from suits brought by the federal government. Quileute Indian Tribe v. Babbitt, 18 F.3d 1456, 1459-60 (9th Cir. 1994); United States v. Yakima Tribal Court, 806 F.2d 853, 861 (9th Cir. 1986); United States v. Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, 827 F.2d 380, 383 (8th Cir. 1987) (\"We conclude that just as a state may not assert sovereign immunity as against the federal government, [United States v.] Mississippi, 380 U.S. [128], 140-41 [(1965)], neither may an Indian tribe, as a dependent nation, do so. Tribal sovereign immunity may not be asserted against the United States . . . .\" ); William C. Canby, Jr., American Indian Law 88 (3d ed. 1998) (\"Tribes are not immune from suits by the United States.\").\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      The Tribe attempts to circumvent the clear rule that Indian tribes do not enjoy sovereign immunity against suits brought by the federal government by arguing that, for these purposes, the EEOC \"is merely a federal commission and does not act as the United States itself.\" This argument finds no support. The EEOC is an entity created by Congress and is specifically authorized by statute to enforce the ADEA, through both administrative action and litigation. 29 U.S.C.&#167;&#167; 626. We know of no principle of law (and the Tribe does not cite any) that differentiates a federal agency such as the EEOC from \"the United States itself\" for the purpose of sovereign immunity analysis.\\n    \\n    II. ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA ENFORCEMENT\\n    \\n      12\\n      It bears repeating that we are not confronted here with an age-discrimination suit brought under the ADEA. Rather, the parties to this action have only reached the investigative stage, and this litigation is a suit to enforce an administrative subpoena. Before considering the applicability of the ADEA to the Tribe, therefore, we must first determine whether we should reach that question at this stage of the proceedings.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      We begin with the Supreme Court\\'s decision in Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, 317 U.S. 501 (1943). In Endicott Johnson, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins issued an administrative subpoena to the petitioner, a government contractor, in the course of an investigation to determine whether the petitioner had violated the Walsh-Healey Act. Id. at 505-07. Notably, the Walsh-Healey Act \"applies only to contractors who voluntarily enter into competition to obtain government business on terms of which they are fairly forewarned by inclusion in the contract.\" Id. at 507. The petitioner argued that he was not required to comply with the subpoena because the alleged violations of the Act occurred in plants that were not involved in government work and, therefore, were not covered by the Act. Id. at 505-07. Stating that \"[t]he evidence sought by the subpoena was not plainly incompetent or irrelevant to any lawful purpose of the Secretary in the discharge of her duties under the Act,\" the Supreme Court concluded that the subpoena should be enforced and that the question whether the Secretary had identified true violations of the Act could be resolved at a later stage of the proceedings. Id. at 508-09.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      The principle of Endicott Johnson -that courts should not refuse to enforce an administrative subpoena when confronted by a fact-based claim regarding coverage or compliance with the law -has been consistently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. Okla. Press Publ\\'g Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 216 (1946); United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 652-53 (1950); United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48, 57-58 (1964). It is also alive and well in this circuit, as illustrated by EEOC v. Children\\'s Hospital Medical Center, 719 F.2d 1426 (9th Cir. 1983) (en banc), which sets forth current law governing the permissible grounds for challenging an administrative subpoena. In Children\\'s Hospital, a private, class-action race discrimination suit ended with a consent decree. After entry of the consent decree, three employees filed claims with the EEOC against the hospital. The EEOC issued administrative subpoenas to the hospital, which refused to comply on the ground that any claims against the hospital were barred by the res judicata effect of the consent decree. The district court agreed with the hospital, reasoning that the EEOC lacked jurisdiction over the hospital because of the consent decree. Id. at 1427.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      This court reversed, holding that it was premature to address the res judicata issue when the only action pending was litigation over enforcement of the administrative subpoenas. As we explained:\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      The scope of the judicial inquiry in an EEOC or any other agency subpoena enforcement proceeding is quite narrow. The critical questions are: (1) whether Congress has granted the authority to investigate; (2) whether procedural requirements have been followed; and (3) whether the evidence is relevant and material to the investigation.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      Id. at 1428 (citing, inter alia, Endicott Johnson, 317 U.S. at 508-09; Okla. Press Publ\\'g, 327 U.S. at 216; Morton Salt, 338 U.S. at 652-53; Powell, 379 U.S. at 57-58). Put another way, courts must enforce administrative subpoenas unless \"the evidence sought by the subpoena [is]`plainly incompetent or irrelevant\\' to `any lawful purpose\\' of the agency.\" Fed. Mar. Comm\\'n v. Port of Seattle, 521 F.2d 431, 433 (9th Cir. 1975) (quoting Endicott Johnson, 317 U.S. at 509). Thus, in Children\\'s Hospital, whether res judicata might bar a subsequent lawsuit was simply irrelevant to the inquiry whether the EEOC could issue administrative subpoenas that might uncover evidence for use in a later lawsuit: \"[A] party may not defeat agency authority to investigate with a claim that could be a defense if the agency subsequently decides to bring an action against it.\" 719 F.2d at 1429; see also, e.g, Pac. Mar. Ass\\'n v. Quinn, 491 F.2d 1294, 1296 (9th Cir. 1974) (party may not raise a factually disputed statute-of-limitations defense in a challenge to an administrative subpoena).\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      The general rule of Endicott Johnson in favor of enforcement of administrative subpoenas thus stands. But it is not absolute. Although a party may not avoid an administrative subpoena on the ground that it has a valid defense to a potential subsequent lawsuit, such a challenge may, in limited circumstances, be mounted when the defense raised is \"jurisdictional\" in nature -i.e., when the agency lacks jurisdiction over the subject of the investigation. See Marshall v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 595 F.2d 511, 513 (9th Cir. 1979) (noting that judicial determination of agency jurisdiction prior to exhaustion is limited). But even where this exception is concerned, the role of a court reviewing a subpoena attacked on jurisdictional grounds is \"strictly limited. \" Casey v. FTC, 578 F.2d 793, 799 (9th Cir. 1978). \"As long as the evidence sought is relevant, material and there is some `plausible\\' ground for jurisdiction, or to phrase it another way, unless jurisdiction is `plainly lacking,\\' the court should enforce the subpoena.\" Children\\'s Hospital, 719 F.2d at 1430 (quoting Burlington Northern, 595 F.2d at 513).\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      Despite these seemingly straightforward ground rules, the inquiry into administrative subpoenas has been complicated by the fact that the words \"coverage\" and\"jurisdiction\" are sometimes used interchangeably, and often imprecisely. See, e.g., Marshall v. Able Contractors, Inc., 573 F.2d 1055, 1056-57 (9th Cir. 1978); Port of Seattle, 521 F.2d at 436; Reich v. Great Lakes Indian Fish &amp; Wildlife Comm\\'n, 4 F.3d 490, 491-92 (7th Cir. 1993). It is important to differentiate \"coverage\" from \"jurisdiction,\" because these two different sorts of challenges lead to different results: factual challenges based on a lack of statutory \"coverage\" are clearly not permitted, see Endicott Johnson, 317 U.S. at 508-10; Okla. Press Publ\\'g, 327 U.S. at 214, while challenges based on \"jurisdiction\" may, in certain circumstances, result in a refusal to enforce a subpoena, see Great Lakes, 4 F.3d at 491-92; Burlington Northern, 595 F.2d at 513.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      This distinction is not merely semantic. There is a difference, particularly in the case of an Indian tribe, between the determination whether an agency has regulatory jurisdiction to enforce a subpoena in the first instance, and the very different question whether a subpoena recipient has a defense to liability under the applicable statute.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      Here, the Tribe\\'s challenge to the EEOC subpoena -that the ADEA does not apply to Indian tribes, and that it enjoys sovereign immunity from the EEOC investigation -falls into a narrow category of cases that is ripe for determination at the enforcement stage. Our approach is consistent with Burlington Northern, where we held in the context of an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") inspection that\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      [j]udicial intervention prior to an agency\\'s initial determination of its jurisdiction is appropriate only where: (1) there is clear evidence that exhaustion of administrative remedies will result in irreparable injury; (2) the agency\\'s jurisdiction is plainly lacking; and (3) the agency\\'s special expertise will be of no help on the question of its jurisdiction.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      595 F.2d at 513. Assuming that the Tribe is correct in its analysis with respect to jurisdiction, the prejudice of subjecting the Tribe to a subpoena for which the agency does not have jurisdiction results in irreparable injury vis-a-vis the Tribe\\'s sovereignty. In addition, the EEOC does not have special expertise in interpretation of statutes with respect to Indians. By contrast, this special circumstance was not present in Burlington Northern.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      For similar reasons, this case is also unlike Endicott Johnson and Children\\'s Hospital. Both of those decisions involved parties that were clearly subject to the federal laws that authorized the administrative investigations. The questions that those courts declined to resolve concerned potential defenses to enforcement actions. In both cases, because the subpoenaed parties could, under some set of facts, be found in violation of federal law, it made sense for the court not to adjudicate the parties\\' fact-specific defenses at the administrative subpoena stage.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      In juxtaposition, this case presents the question whether the Karuk Tribe Housing Authority, in its role as Grant\\'s employer, is subject to the ADEA at all, whatever the facts of the actual discrimination charge may be. The Tribe asserts that it falls into a category of entity not subject to the ADEA, and thus not subject to investigation by the EEOC. Whether this is so is a pure question of law, the resolution of which does not depend on a factual inquiry, and which would not undermine the role of subpoena enforcement actions as \"summary procedure[s]\" designed to allow \"speedy investigation of EEOC charges.\" EEOC v. St. Regis Paper Co. , 717 F.2d 1302, 1304 (9th Cir. 1983).\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Here the jurisdictional question is particularly sensitive because it involves the Karuk Tribe, which, like other tribes, enjoys a unique legal status as a sovereign. See Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U.S. 759, 764 (1985). In this context, the prejudice from compliance is real. See Great Lakes, 4 F.3d at 492 (\"The Commission should not be burdened with having to comply with a subpoena if, as the district court believed, the agency issuing it has no jurisdiction to regulate the wages that the Commission pays. Questions of regulatory jurisdiction are properly addressed at the subpoena-enforcement stage if, as here, they are ripe for determination at that stage. Compliance with a subpoena is a burden, and one that a person or institution that can show it is not subject to the regulatory regime in aid of which the subpoena was issued should not be required to bear.\" (citations omitted));3 see also EEOC v. Cherokee Nation, 871 F.2d 937 (10th Cir. 1989) (adjudicating issue of applicability of the ADEA to Indian tribes in the context of a subpoena enforcement action). The Tribe\\'s challenge to the EEOC\\'s administrative subpoena is jurisdictional in nature and thus may be resolved here as a matter of law.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      III. APPLICABILITY OF THE ADEATO INDIAN TRIBES\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      We thus turn to the substantive issue in this case: whether the Tribe is subject to the ADEA in its role as Grant\\'s employer. Our starting point in analyzing whether a federal statute applies to tribes is Federal Power Commission v. Tuscarora Indian Nation, 362 U.S. 99, 120 (1960), in which the Supreme Court held that \"general acts of Congress apply to Indians as well as to all others in the absence of a clear expression to the contrary.\" We have, however, carved out certain exceptions to this rule of general applicability. Where, as here, a statute is silent with respect to Indians, see 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 630 (defining entities subject to the ADEA), we follow the rule set forth in Donovan v. Coeur d\\'Alene Tribal Farm, 751 F.2d 1113, 1116 (9th Cir. 1985):\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      A federal statute of general applicability that is silent on the issue of applicability to Indian tribes will not apply to them if: (1) the law touches \"exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural matters\"; (2) the application of the law to the tribe would \"abrogate rights guaranteed by Indian treaties\"; or (3) there is proof \"by legislative history or some other means that Congress intended [the law] not to apply to Indians on their reservations . . . .\" In any of these three situations, Congress must expressly apply a statute to Indians before we will hold that it reaches them.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      (emphasis in original) (quoting United States v. Farris, 624 F.2d 890, 893-94 (9th Cir. 1980)). The parties to this appeal agree that only the first Coeur d\\'Alene exception -whether \"the law touches exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural matters,\" 751 F.2d at 1116 -is at issue here.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      In Coeur d\\'Alene itself, we addressed the first exception, holding that the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 651 et seq., applied to a commercial farm operated by a tribe. We explained that \"the tribal self-government exception is designed to except purely intramural matters such as conditions of tribal membership, inheritance rules, and domestic relations from the general rule that otherwise applicable federal statutes apply to Indian tribes.\" Coeur d\\'Alene, 751 F.2d at 1116. We must decide, then, whether employment practices at the Karuk Tribe Housing Authority are\"purely intramural matters\" touching on the tribe\\'s \"exclusive rights of self-governance.\" If so, the statute does not apply in these circumstances.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      The two other circuits to confront this issue, the Eighth and the Tenth, have conducted such a \"self-governance \" analysis in determining whether the ADEA applies to tribal employers. Both reached the conclusion that the ADEA did not apply in the particular circumstances presented. See EEOC v. Fond du Lac Heavy Equip. &amp; Constr. Co., Inc., 986 F.2d 246 (8th Cir. 1993); EEOC v. Cherokee Nation, 871 F.2d 937 (10th Cir. 1989).\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      In Fond du Lac, a tribal member brought an ADEA claim against his employer, a company located on the reservation and wholly owned by the tribe. 986 F.2d at 248. The Eighth Circuit framed the issue by noting that \" `areas traditionally left to tribal self government, those most often the subject of treaties, have enjoyed an exception from the general rule that congressional enactments, in terms applying to all persons, includes Indians and their property interests.\\' \" Id. (quoting United States v. White, 508 F.2d 453, 455 (8th Cir. 1974)). The court went on to apply those general principles to alleged age discrimination within tribes:\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      The facts in this case reveal that this dispute involves a strictly internal matter. The dispute is between an Indian applicant and an Indian tribal employer. The Indian applicant is a member of the tribe, and the business is located on the reservation. Subjecting such an employment relationship between the tribal member and his tribe to federal control and supervision dilutes the sovereignty of the tribe. The consideration of a tribe member\\'s age by a tribal employer should be allowed to be restricted (or not restricted) by the tribe in accordance with its culture and traditions. Likewise, disputes regarding this issue should be allowed to be resolved internally within the tribe. Federal regulation of the tribal employer\\'s consideration of age in determining whether to hire the member of the tribe to work at the business located on the reservation interferes with an intramural matter that has traditionally been left to the tribe\\'s self-government.\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      Fond du Lac, 986 F.2d at 249.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      In analyzing the same issue, the Tenth Circuit in Cherokee Nation reached the same result via different reasoning. It relied on the second Coeur d\\'Alene exception (as opposed to general principles of Indian sovereignty cited in Fond du Lac), finding a right to tribal self-government derived from a treaty \"unequivocally recogniz[ing] tribal self-government.\" 871 F.2d at 938. That discussion is relevant here, however, because \"[t]he identical right should not have a different effect because it arises from general treaty language rather than recognized, inherent sovereign rights.\" United States Dep\\'t of Labor v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\\'n, 935 F.2d 182, 186 (9th Cir. 1991). The Tenth Circuit did not specifically explain how the application of the ADEA to the tribe -in particular, to its employment relationship with an employee of a tribal health care service -would infringe on the right to self-government. Instead, the court stated that, because the ADEA is silent on its applicability to Indian tribes, and rules of statutory construction require that ambiguous provisions be construed \"liberally in favor of the Indians,\" Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U.S. at 766, the ADEA does not apply to Indian tribes.\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      Although our analysis differs somewhat, we reach the same result as both the Eighth and Tenth Circuits and hold that the ADEA does not apply to Grant\\'s employment relationship with the Karuk Tribe Housing Authority because it touches on \"purely internal matters\" related to the tribe\\'s self-governance.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      Notably, the employer in this case is the tribal government, acting in its role as provider of a governmental service: ensuring adequate housing for its members. The federal law that provides funds for the Housing Authority specifies that such funds \"should be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal selfgovernance\":\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      (2) there exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people; . . . (6) . . . the Federal Government should work . . . to achieve the goals of economic self-sufficiency and self-determination for tribes and their members; and (7) Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities should be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance . . . .\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4101. The legislation highlights the importance of \"affordable homes in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations [and] in Indian communities,\" as a means to achieve \"self-sufficiency and self-determination. \" Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      The Housing Authority thus functions as an arm of the tribal government and in a governmental role. It is not simply a business entity that happens to be run by a tribe or its members, but, rather, occupies a role quintessentially related to self-governance. Courts conducting \"self-governance\" analysis have distinguished such essentially governmental functions from commercial activities undertaken by tribes and have classified actual tribal governmental entities as aspects of \"self-government,\" see, e.g., Fond du Lac, 986 F.2d at 246; Cherokee Nation, 871 F.2d at 937, while rejecting such a categorization for businesses that happen to be owned and operated by tribes, see, e.g., Fla. Paraplegic Ass\\'n, Inc. v. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla., 166 F.3d 1126, 1129 (11th Cir. 1999) (\"tribe-run business enterprises acting in interstate commerce do not fall under the `self-governance\\' exception\" to Coeur d\\'Alene; the enterprise at issue \"does not relate to the governmental functions of the Tribe, nor does it operate exclusively within the domain of the Tribe and its members\"); Reich v. Mashantucket Sand &amp; Gravel, 95 F.3d 174, 181 (2d Cir. 1996) (OSHA has jurisdiction over a tribe-owned business because the \"nature of MSG\\'s work, its employment of non-Indians, and the construction work on a hotel and casino that operates in interstate commerce -when viewed as a whole, result in a mosaic that is distinctly inconsistent with the portrait of an Indian tribe exercising exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural matters\"); Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\\'n, 935 F.2d at 184 (tribal employer is subject to OSHA because it\"employs a significant number of non-Native Americans and sells virtually all of its finished product to non-Native Americans through channels of interstate commerce\"); Coeur d\\'Alene, 751 F.2d at 1116 (\"The operation of a farm that sells produce on the open market and in interstate commerce is not an aspect of tribal self-government. Because the Farm .. . is in virtually every respect a normal commercial farming enterprise, we believe that its operation free of federal health and safety regulations is `neither profoundly intramural . . . nor essential to self-government.\\' \" (quoting Farris, 624 F.2d at 893)).\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      Further, the dispute here is entirely \"intramural,\" between the tribal government and a member of the Tribe. See Fond du Lac, 986 F.2d at 249 (\"The dispute is between an Indian applicant and an Indian tribal employer. The Indian applicant is a member of the tribe, and the business is located on the reservation.\"). It does not concern non-Karuks or non-Indians as employers, employees, customers, or anything else. See Mashantucket Sand &amp; Gravel, 95 F.3d at 181 (\"MSG\\'s employment of non-Indians weighs heavily against its claim that its activities affect rights of self-governance in purely intramural matters. In general, tribal relations with non-Indians fall outside the normal ambit of tribal selfgovernment. Furthermore, intramural matters generally consist of conduct the immediate ramifications of which are felt primarily within the reservation by members of the tribe.\") (citing Farris, 624 F.2d at 893). The intramural nature of the dispute here is underscored by the fact that the Tribe has an established internal process for adjudicating such matters, a process of which Grant availed himself. See Fond du Lac, 986 F.2d at 249 (\"[D]isputes regarding this issue should be allowed to be resolved internally within the tribe.\").\\n    \\n    \\n      43\\n      Our conclusion is further bolstered by general acceptance of the notion that the term \"tribal self-government,\" or a similar term, encompasses a tribe\\'s ability to make at least certain employment decisions without interference from other sovereigns. See, e.g., Penobscot Nation v. Fellencer, 164 F.3d 706, 709-11 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1022 (1999) (tribe not subject to a state anti-discrimination statute in discharging a non-Indian from position as nurse in tribe-run health center); Pink v. Modoc Indian Health Project, Inc., 157 F.3d 1185, 1188 (9th Cir. 1998) (Indian has no cause of action under Title VII against a tribal non-profit entity which \"served as an arm of the sovereign tribes, acting as more than a mere business\"); Great Lakes, 4 F.3d at 494-96 (\"it has been traditional to leave the administration of Indian affairs for the most part to the Indians themselves\"; U.S. Department of Labor had sought to investigate tribal commission for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act).\\n    \\n    \\n      44\\n      The EEOC maintains that this case may be resolved by applying traditional rules of statutory construction without regard to the Coeur d\\'Alene \"self-governance\" exception to the Tuscarora rule. Its suggestion misses the mark for two reasons: (1) we are bound by the Coeur d\\'Alene exceptions adopted by the Ninth Circuit, and (2) the standard rules of statutory construction do not adhere in Indian law. The EEOC is correct that, under traditional rules of statutory construction, it can be argued logically that the ADEA does apply to Indian tribes. The definitions of \"employer\" in Title VII and the ADEA are nearly identical, except that Title VII, which was enacted three years before the ADEA, specifically exempts Indian tribes from its coverage. Compare 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 630 (ADEA) (silence as to Indian tribes) with 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e(b)(1) (Title VII) (explicit exclusion of Indian tribes from statutory coverage). Given that Congress is presumed to act with deliberation when drafting statutes, see United States v. Motamedi, 767 F.2d 1403, 1406 (9th Cir. 1985), Congress\\' explicit exemption of Indian tribes from Title VII\\'s coverage could lead to the conclusion that it intended not to include such an Indian exemption in the ADEA, see Binder v. Long Island Lighting Co., 933 F.2d 187, 193 (2d Cir. 1991) (\"[O]mission in the text of the ADEA of a provision found in Title VII is likely to reflect a deliberate decision on Congress\\'s part.\").\\n    \\n    \\n      45\\n      Such analysis, however, does not account for the rule that \"the standard principles of statutory construction do not have their usual force in cases involving Indian law. \" Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U.S. at 766. Rather, \"[b]ecause of the unique legal status of Indians in American jurisprudence, legal doctrines often must be viewed from a different perspective from that which would obtain in other areas of the law.\" Native Village of Venetie I.R.A. Council v. Alaska, 944 F.2d 548, 553 (9th Cir. 1991); see also County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation, 470 U.S. 226, 247 (1985) (\"The canons of construction applicable in Indian law are rooted in the unique trust relationship between the United States and the Indians. Thus, it is well established that treaties should be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit. . . . The Court has applied similar canons of construction in nontreaty matters.\" (citations omitted)); Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130, 152 (1982) (\"[I]f there [is] ambiguity . . . , the doubt would benefit the Tribe, for `[a]mbiguities in federal law have been construed generously in order to comport with . . . traditional notions of sovereignty and with the federal policy of encouraging tribal independence.\\' \" (quoting White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 143-44 (1980))). Thus we do not apply the normal rules of statutory construction here, but, instead, must be guided by doctrine specific to Indian law --the Coeur d\\'Alene exception that we applied above.\\n    \\n    \\n      46\\n      In sum, we conclude that regulation of the employment relationship between the Housing Authority and Grant does \"touch[ ] exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural matters,\" Coeur d\\'Alene, 751 F.2d at 1116. Because this exception to the Tuscarora rule, 362 U.S. at 120, applies, the ADEA is applicable to Indian tribes only if Congress explicitly so indicated. See Coeur d\\'Alene, 751 F.2d at 1116 (if any of the exceptions applies, \"Congress must expressly apply a statute to Indians before we will hold that it reaches them\" (emphasis in original)). The ADEA contains no such explicit reference; indeed, as noted above, the ADEA is silent as to its applicability to Indian tribes.

WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:\\n    \\n    \\n      1\\n      These appeals all arise out of a consent decree entered in 1982 and intended to resolve a suit initially filed in 1979 and refiled later as a class action.  The suit sought broad changes in living conditions at the Central Facility at the District of Columbia\\'s prison in Lorton, Virginia.  It was one of a number of class actions brought on behalf of prisoners at different Lorton facilities.  For a brief description, see Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, 841 F.2d 1133, 1134-36 (D.C.Cir.1988).\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      After the District was exposed to the risk of heavy contempt fines for alleged violations of the 1982 decree, it and the lawyers for the plaintiff class negotiated a settlement under which some of the fines would be held in abeyance and ultimately returned if the District met certain staffing levels at Central.  After learning of the proposed settlement, six prisoners at Central filed pro se motions in district court, styled motions for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.  Specifically, the motions asked the court to oust class counsel and to substitute therefor Kemi Morten (who later entered an appearance for the dissident inmates), to appoint a receiver to run Central, and to grant a protective order against retaliation.  Besides being a lawyer, Morten is executive director of a substance abuse treatment program known as Unfoldment, which once operated at Central.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      The court denied the T.R.O.  On December 5, 1995 it held a hearing on the preliminary injunction, and Morten represented to the district court that her clients were supported by 1,100 of 1,300 inmates at Central, as evidenced by petitions circulated and signed by the inmates during the month of November after the filing of the motions.  The petitions identified the six movant prisoners as representatives of the \"Blacktop Coalition,\" and asked for relief akin to that sought in the motions, plus restoration of the Unfoldment program.  Together with some [326 U.S.App.D.C. 19] of the dissident inmates themselves, Morten argued for the self-styled motion for a preliminary injunction, proposing broad changes in conditions at Central, some with only limited reference to the Twelve John Does consent decree.  She also asked that the dissidents\\' motion be considered one to intervene in the class action as a subclass, arguing that class counsel and the plaintiffs\\' committee, the Twelve John Does, no longer adequately represented the inmates\\' interests.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      At the end of the hearing the district court observed that class counsel had said that the Blacktop representatives \"will be added to the group who customarily meet with [class counsel], and that is what the court is granting today, and that is all the court is granting today.\"   Asked by Morten about the motion to intervene as a subclass, the court said, \"No, denied.\"   In an order filed the next day, the district court formalized its disposition of the motions.  Noting that the \"motion for a preliminary injunction\" was in reality a motion for substitution of counsel and appointment of a receiver, the court denied it, expressing doubt that the signers of the petition were fully informed of the limited nature of the pending case and stating, \"In the 15 years since this case began, the Court has had the opportunity to observe the level of representation provided by [class counsel] and is satisfied that the class is receiving legal representation of the highest quality.\"   Order, Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, Civ. Action No. 80-2136 (D.D.C. December 6, 1995) (\"December 6, 1995 Order\") at 3.  The court also reiterated its oral denial of the six dissidents\\' motion to intervene as a subclass, finding that the \"class is receiving quality representation;  that class counsel listens to and communicates with members of the class and advocates zealously for the class.\"  Id. at 4. The court rejected the notion that class counsel had in any way slacked in pursuit of contempt findings where appropriate, and also said, apropos the dissident inmates\\' substantive claims, \"While inmates have been important to enforcement of the consent decree through reporting to the special officer and to class counsel, many of the concerns stated by the petitioners at the hearing on this matter are not properly a part of the consent decree.\"  Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      The district court also granted the six dissidents\\' request for a protective order, of which there had been no mention at the oral hearing.  See id. at 5.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Both the dissidents and the District moved for reconsideration of the December 6, 1995 Order.  The dissidents renewed their request for the relief they had sought but not attained, and the District sought to overturn the one item the dissidents had secured, the protective order.  The court denied both motions in an order filed March 4, 1996.  Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, Civ. Action No. 80-2136 (D.D.C. March 4, 1996) (\"March 4, 1996 Order\").\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      In the meantime, class counsel and the District worked out their resolution of the looming contempt issues, and on February 26, 1996 the court entered a consent order reflecting that agreement.  Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, Civ. Action No. 80-2136 (D.D.C. February 26, 1996) (\"February 26, 1996 Consent Order\").  The dissident prisoners filed a notice of appeal from the entry of the order, which the district court struck on the grounds that they were not parties.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      From this tangle of events we have before us three appeals.  (1) In No. 96-5106, the dissident prisoners challenge the district court\\'s denial of their motion for reconsideration of its earlier denial of the bulk of the relief they had sought.  (2) In No. 96-5107, the dissident prisoners appeal the district court\\'s order striking their notice of appeal of the February 26, 1996 Consent Order.  (3) In No. 96-5089, the District of Columbia appeals the court\\'s grant of the protective order and the denial of its motion for reconsideration.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      We affirm in Nos. 96-5106 and 96-5107 and reverse in No. 96-5089.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      I. The Prisoner Appeals, Nos. 96-5106 and 96-5107\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Class counsel argue that these appeals are barred by a prior decision of this court and are in any event moot.  The claim of bar arises from our disposition of an appeal [326 U.S.App.D.C. 20]  from the court\\'s initial order denying the moving prisoners\\' motions--recall that in No. 96-5106 they appeal from the district court\\'s denial of the motion for reconsideration of that order.  In the earlier appeal the prisoners obscurely raised the issue of the denial of their motion to intervene, and in an unpublished order, Nathaniel El McQueen v. District of Columbia, 1996 WL 453633, No. 96-5003 (D.C.Cir. July 18, 1996), reh\\'g denied, (D.C.Cir. Sept. 6, 1996), which focussed on the challenge to class counsel and did not mention the intervention issue, we dismissed the appeal for want of a final judgment.  The direct appeal from the district court\\'s order denying the prisoners\\' motion having been ruled interlocutory, class counsel say that this disposes of both appeals.  It eliminates No. 96-5106 because that appeal at best replicates the dismissed appeal from the initial order;  it eliminates No. 96-5107 because if the dissident prisoners are without party status, the district court was clearly right to strike their notice of appeal.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      We need not examine whether the case might fall within one of the exceptions to the doctrine of the law of the case.  See LaShawn v. Barry, 87 F.3d 1389, 1393 (D.C.Cir.1996) (noting limited character of exceptions).  Compare Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. B &amp; O R Co., 331 U.S. 519, 524-25, 531-32, 67 S.Ct. 1387, 1389-90, 1393, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947) (denial of intervention immediately appealable where intervention as of right is sought).  The Sixth Circuit has held that where members of a class have unsuccessfully sought to intervene separately but have not appealed the denial, and later seek to appeal a final order, they are entitled to raise the intervention issue on appeal from the final order (even though, by hypothesis, they have not yet acquired party status).  Shults v. Champion International Corp., 35 F.3d 1056, 1059-61 (6th Cir.1994).  See also Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U.S. 301, 304, 108 S.Ct. 586, 587, 98 L.Ed.2d 629 (1988) (non-parties adversely affected by consent decree approving settlement should \"seek intervention for purposes of appeal;  denials of such motions are, of course, appealable\").  We need not consider whether we would adopt the Shults approach for a would-be intervenor that had failed to avail itself of an available opportunity for appeal.  Where, as here, the would-be intervenors had no earlier opportunity for appeal, they should be able to raise the supposed error in the denial of intervention simultaneously with their appeal of the later appealable order whose imminent entry was precisely the occasion for their intervention effort.  Thus, assuming that the movants\\' appeal in No. 96-5106 is barred by law of the case as to the interlocutory character of the denial of intervention, they remain free to press the intervention issue in their appeal in No. 96-5107, seeking relief from the February 26, 1996 Consent Order.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      There remains, of course, the question whether the 1996 consent decree itself is a final order or among the exceptional class of interlocutory orders over which we have jurisdiction.  The decree mandates certain primary conduct (i.e., conduct in the real world, outside the litigation itself) and in addition modifies the terms of a prior consent decree controlling the defendant\\'s primary conduct.  Thus, whether or not final, it qualifies as an order \"granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions ...,\" for which 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1) provides appellate jurisdiction.  See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d 1448, 1455-56 (D.C.Cir.1995).\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      In exercising jurisdiction over the movants\\' appeal in No. 96-5107 (attacking the district court\\'s striking of their notice of appeal from the consent decree), of course we have jurisdiction to review the prior rejection of their motion to intervene as a subclass, on which that appeal inextricably depends.  This is so regardless of whether we classify the intervention issue as denial of intervention as of right, which is appealable in itself, see Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, 331 U.S. at 524-25, 531-32, 67 S.Ct. at 1389-90, 1393-94 or as denial of permissive intervention or denial of certification as a subclass, which normally would not be.  See id.;  McCarthy v. Kleindienst, 562 F.2d 1269, 1276 (D.C.Cir.1977) (denial of class certification normally not immediately appealable).  As Gilda Marx, Inc. v. Wildwood Exercise, Inc., 85 F.3d 675 (D.C.Cir.1996), illustrates, our pendent appellate jurisdiction encompasses at least determinations that are inextricably intertwined [326 U.S.App.D.C. 21]  with ones over which we have direct jurisdiction.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      Class counsel argues that the movants\\' appeals are moot because they have been transferred from Central to other facilities.  The movants have not legally sought retransfer back to Central, as Morten conceded at oral argument, so it would appear that they no longer have individual interests in conditions at Central.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      But the movants have not sought to vindicate only their individual concerns.  They also sought to intervene as a subclass.  A party certified as class representative may pursue the class claim even after his purely individual claim becomes moot, Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975), and a named plaintiff who has merely asked for class certification may appeal the denial of class certification even after his individual claim becomes moot, United States Parole Comm\\'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397-404, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 1208-1212, 63 L.Ed.2d 479 (1980).  The Court reasoned in Geraghty that the proposed class representative\\'s interest was akin to that of a private attorney general, a right deliberately created in order to make it possible to realize the benefits of the class action form.  Id. at 403, 100 S.Ct. at 1212.  Geraghty\\'s logic, in finding that that interest was significant enough to preserve the case from mootness, appears to apply to the interest of a party that has sought to intervene as representative of a subclass.  Superficially, it may not seem within the stated purpose of Geraghty to allow the representative interest of persons seeking to splinter a class to save that splintering effort from mootness.  But the use of a subclass makes it possible to preserve the class action form where the named representative cannot be found to adequately represent all the interests in the class, see 7B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure:  Civil &#167; 1790 at 276-84 (2d ed.1986);  see also Fink v. National Savings and Trust Co., 772 F.2d 951, 960-61 (D.C.Cir.1985) (finding that district judge ought to have considered possibility of subclasses before denying class certification and citing Geraghty), so application of Geraghty to subclass claims seems within its spirit.  Thus at last we turn to the issue of whether the district court correctly denied the dissidents\\' motion to intervene as a subclass.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      We review the decision for abuse of discretion.  Because the balance between keeping class litigation manageable and allowing affected parties to be adequately heard turns on a myriad of case-specific facts, the abuse-of-discretion standard governs most of the related issues--the decisions to certify a class, see Fink, 772 F.2d at 960, to allow permissive intervention under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b), Hodgson v. United Mine Workers, 473 F.2d 118, 125 &amp; n. 36 (D.C.Cir.1972), and to allow intervention as of right to the extent that it turns on the adequacy of representation by existing parties, id.   As Fed.  R. Civ. Pro. 23(c)(4)(B) authorizes the district court to create subclasses \"when appropriate,\" it implies the same need for reasonable discretion, even recognizing that any subclass must independently meet the standards for class certification.  See 7B Wright et al. &#167; 1790 at 276-85.  Particularly as the parties agree that the district court correctly framed the issue as whether the would-be intervenors were adequately represented, cf. id. &#167; 1799 at 440-41 (\"if the court determines that the nonparty class members are adequately represented, intervention as of right under Rule 24(a) should be unavailable\"), the abuse of discretion standard appropriately controls.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Among the many factors governing the district court\\'s decision that the prisoners are adequately represented are the quality of class counsel, any disparity in interest between class representatives and members of a would-be subclass, communication between class counsel and the class, and the overall context of the litigation.  7A Wright et al. &#167; 1766 at 297-98, &#167; 1768 at 326.  Or, as this court once put it:  \"Two criteria for determining the adequacy of representation are generally recognized:  1) the named representative must not have antagonistic or conflicting interests with the unnamed members of the class, and 2) the representative must appear able to vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.\"  National Association of Regional Medical Programs, [326 U.S.App.D.C. 22]  Inc. v. Mathews, 551 F.2d 340, 345 (D.C.Cir.1976).\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      In this case, we see no reason not to accept the district court\\'s finding that the members of the class are receiving adequate representation.  The dissidents make no real challenge to the general finding of the district judge that class counsel has performed at the highest level.  Nor do they argue that their interests are in some fundamental, structural way different from those of the members of the Twelve John Does committee.  Cf. Davis v. Board of School Comm\\'rs, 600 F.2d 470, 472 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1979) (upholding denial of intervention in school desegregation suit by persons seeking to represent black professional employees as a subclass in larger class action).  In fact, then, the dissidents\\' claim that they are inadequately represented depends solely on their claims that class counsel has failed to maintain adequate communication with, and to be sufficiently responsive to, members of the class.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      Here, of course, the district court\\'s experience overseeing the case for nearly two decades has given it a unique familiarity with the issues and the performance of class counsel.  See McNeil v. Guthrie, 945 F.2d 1163, 1167 (10th Cir.1991) (noting that district court directly familiar with adequacy of class counsel\\'s representation need not hold hearing on challenges to adequacy).  To the extent that the would-be intervenors\\' point to the dispute over the scope of the February 26, 1996 Consent Order as evidence of unresponsiveness, the claim is weak.  The district court observed:\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      At the hearing held on this motion on December 5, 1995, it became apparent to the Court that petitioners believed they could achieve concessions not contained in the consent decree including:  preventing the out of state transfer of inmates;  inmate participation in the Central Facility\\'s food preparation and service;  and, greater educational and vocational programs.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      December 6, 1995 Order at 3 n.2.  Although the movants point to general language in the Consent Decree calling for an \"effort to develop and to expand the institutionally operated programs at Central,\" see \"Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Reconsider December 6, 1995 Order,\" at 19 n.6 (quoting Consent Decree at 32), they appear to recognize that a ban on out-of-state transfers is no more than a possible subject for negotiations to modify the Consent Decree, which could be said of any issue.  They see the food preparation proposal as pertinent to the decree only in the sense of lying within its general language on program development.  Furthermore, the original lawsuit itself focussed on security issues, chiefly the prevention of inmate-on-inmate violence.  See Complaint at 3, 26-28, pp 1, 84-92, Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, Civ. Action No. 80-2136 (D.D.C. Aug. 20, 1980).  Although the complaint described inadequate living conditions, including inadequate and unhygenic food facilities, it did so in the context of the anger that such conditions are likely to engender, with a resulting increase in the risk of violence.  See Complaint at 23, p 75.  Given class counsel\\'s continuing efforts to secure the District\\'s compliance with specific, numerical criteria provided in the Consent Decree that are directly linked to the original lawsuit, its failure to embrace the dissidents\\' agenda--even the portions technically within the scope of the original complaint and the 1982 decree--hardly undermines the district court\\'s findings as to adequacy of representation.  This is especially true for the first item in the dissidents\\' proposed consent order, that the court require the District to set aside money specifically for Kemi Morten\\'s Unfoldment program.  Joint Appendix at 196-97.  It is also true for the second, a food preparation or \"culinary arts\" program under which prisoners would be paid the minimum wage and the prison members of the Blacktop Coalition would choose the prison guards with whom inmates would work.  Id. at 197.   The movants have by no means shown that counsel\\'s advocacy of the February 26, 1996 Consent Order in preference to the Coalition\\'s agenda was not in the best interests of the class.  Cf. Kincade v. General Tire and Rubber Co., 635 F.2d 501, 508 (5th Cir.1981).\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Nor have the prisoners made out the other aspects of the claim that there is a failure to communicate, namely, that the named representatives [326 U.S.App.D.C. 23]  and class counsel have lost touch with the class members and are proceeding without appropriate consultations, and that the class members\\' views are more accurately reflected by the Blacktop Coalition.  What sparked the Blacktop Coalition\\'s intervention effort was news of an October 11, 1995 agreement in principle to resolve the dispute over the District\\'s failure to comply with the 1982 decree, as amended.  Apart from their attack on its substantive terms (already reviewed), the Coalition complains about inadequate advance consultation over the agreement.  But class counsel explained that since the agreement was initially reached at a court hearing, it did not have an opportunity to present it to the class earlier.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      There is little information before us about the role of the named representatives.  We know that their names were placed under seal by court order--hence the eponymous Twelve John Does Committee--and that the Committee (like the Blacktop Coalition) is a self-constituted body whose membership has evidently changed over the years.  But its constitution, however informal, has not sharply constrained class counsel\\'s access to the prison population.  Counsel meets as well with other inmates who prove to be reliable sources of information, and has offered to meet with members of the Blacktop Coalition.  In addition, class counsel accepts all collect phone calls from Central.  There is also a court appointed special officer overseeing implementation of the Consent Decree, who can report any problems in communication either to the court or to class counsel.  Thus the movants have not successfully made out a claim of systemic failure of communication.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      At the most, the prisoner movants demonstrated that they feel left out of what is clearly a very important matter in their lives;  and, of course, the petitions signed by 1100 inmates suggest that the feeling is widespread.  But a class action of this sort in any case risks becoming \"in ways more akin to congressional hearings than judicial proceedings,\" Jones v. Caddo Parish School Bd., 735 F.2d 923, 938 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc) (Higginbotham, J., concurring), with every possible issue on the table.  As class counsel is pursuing the interests of the class energetically and skillfully, and much of the Blacktop Coalition\\'s alternative program is outside or marginal to the 1982 consent decree (so that its pursuit would further aggravate the formlessness of the suit), we have no grounds to reject the district court\\'s decision to deny intervention.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      II. The District\\'s Appeal, No. 96-5089.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      The District objects to the district court\\'s prohibition, in its December 6, 1995 Order, of retaliation against any of the six movants or the 1100 or so inmates who signed the supporting petition.  The District\\'s primary claim is (as it was in their motion for reconsideration) that the order was entered without any factual basis, such as evidence of prior retaliatory action, in violation of the Supreme Court\\'s decision in Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 2179, 2183, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996), as well as of our own decision in Ellis v. District of Columbia, 84 F.3d 1413 (D.C.Cir.1996), antedating Lewis, which makes clear that, at least where judicial action aimed at protecting constitutional claims would involve broad control over a local government\\'s management of its affairs, injunctive relief can be granted only if there is \"a pervasive pattern ... flowing from a deliberate plan by the named defendants.\"  Id. at 1424 (internal quotations omitted).\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      Class counsel, defending the protective order, relies in large part on the ground that until its motion for reconsideration the District did not oppose the movants\\' request for such an order, either in writing or at the December 5, 1995 hearing.  The District retorts that the movants\\' failure to present any support (or even argument) for the motion led it to believe that the request had been abandoned.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      In fact, Local Rule 108(b) of the district court requires that a party respond to a motion within 11 days.  If not, \"the court may treat the motion as conceded.\"   D.C. District Court Local Rule 108(b) (emphasis added).  Where the district court relies on the absence of a response as a basis for treating the motion as conceded, we honor its enforcement of the rule.  See Geller v. Randi, [326 U.S.App.D.C. 24]  40 F.3d 1300, 1304-05 (D.C.Cir.1994).  Here, however, the district court did not exercise its discretion to treat the motion as conceded, but acted on the merits.  Rule 108(b) thus does not appear to be a bar.  Cf.  Moy v. Howard University, 843 F.2d 1504, 1504 (D.C.Cir.1988).\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      Class counsel makes the related point, however, that the District\\'s failure to object to the lack of fact-finding until the motion for reconsideration waives the argument for appeal.  But Rule 60(b)(1) authorizes relief from a judgment on grounds of \"mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\"   In fact, we have construed Rule 60(b)(6)\\'s catchall provision, allowing correction for \"any other reason justifying relief,\" as calling for relief in extreme cases even where the moving party has been guilty of inexcusable neglect:\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      When a party timely presents a previously undisclosed fact so central to the litigation that it shows the initial judgment to have been manifestly unjust, reconsideration under rule 60(b)(6) is proper even though the original failure to present that information was inexcusable.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility v. United States Secret Service, 72 F.3d 897, 903 (D.C.Cir.1996) (quoting and following Good Luck Nursing Home, Inc. v. Harris, 636 F.2d 572, 577 (D.C.Cir.1980)).  Here the circumstances call for a finding that the District\\'s neglect was excusable.\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      The primary issue at the December 5, 1995 hearing was the one we have already addressed--whether the movants\\' claims about adequacy of representation justified either the grant of their motion to intervene as a subclass or any other relief altering the system of representation.  No one said a word to support the motion for a protective order.  As the hearing drew to a close, the court said that the six dissidents would \"be added to the group who customarily meet with [class counsel], and that is what the court is granting today, and that is all the court is granting today\";  it also said explicitly that the motion to intervene as a subclass was \"denied.\"   Although the motion for a protective order was in a formal sense on the table during the hearing, its proponents never advanced it, and the court unequivocally rejected the idea that its proponents should have any formal status in the lawsuit.  While class counsel had said that it did not object to the motion, see Opposition on Behalf of Plaintiff Class to Motion of Pro Se Movants for a Preliminary Injunction, at1-2, Joint Appendix 100-01, it never offered affirmative support.  Thus the motion appeared to be a complete orphan.  Indeed, later, in denying the District\\'s motion for reconsideration, the district court relied on its \"inherent authority\" to issue the order.  March 4, 1996 Order at 2.  In the circumstances the District\\'s silence on the subject was excusable.  Finally, once the issue was raised the district court justified its decision issuing the order without factual support by saying it was doing so \"prophylactically,\" id., which suggests that no earlier objection on that ground would have made any difference.\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      On the merits, class counsel\\'s answer to Lewis v. Casey and Ellis v. District of Columbia is twofold.  First, it points to Women Prisoners of the District of Columbia Dep\\'t of Corrections v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d 910 (D.C.Cir.1996), where we upheld an anti-retaliation order based on evidence that women \"who had filed complaints ... were occasionally the victims of retaliation.\"  Id. at 931.   It is unclear why class counsel believes that this supports issuance of an order in the absence of any such evidence.  Further, although class counsel argues that in Women Prisoners the District sought reversal on the theory that there was no evidence of systemwide retaliation, the relevant passage of the opinion says nothing of such a claim, or of Lewis or Ellis (though Lewis is noted earlier in the opinion, id. at 920, 923).\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      Second, class counsel argues that a ban on retaliation is free of the demands of Lewis because, unlike the order there, it has nothing to do with the management of the prison;  it bars only retaliatory conduct that would be illegal in any event.  Counsel also points to our decision in Wagner v. Taylor, 836 F.2d 566, 571 (D.C.Cir.1987), in which we upheld the district court\\'s jurisdiction to enjoin retaliation by the Interstate Commerce Commission against a Title VII plaintiff who asserted that he might be subject to reprisals pending administrative adjudication of his claim.  But a ban on retaliation plainly does [326 U.S.App.D.C. 25] impact the management of the prison.  Every act adverse to one of the protected parties (here, almost the entire prison population) creates at least a risk of contempt proceedings whose outcome would turn on elusive questions of motivation.  As for Wagner v. Taylor, it yields no support for the order.  Having found district court jurisdiction to provide such relief, 836 F.2d at 570-75, we noted that any decision to actually grant the relief depended on satisfying the usual criteria for injunctions, and affirmed the district court\\'s denial of one, in large part because the plaintiff \"offered no supporting evidence\" that retaliation was imminent, other than copies of his own complaints, id. at 576.   Thus the complete absence of factual support for the ban in the record is a fatal deficiency.  In these circumstances it was an abuse of discretion for the court to deny the motion for reconsideration.  See Lepkowski v. United States Dept. of Treasury, 804 F.2d 1310, 1311 (D.C.Cir.1986) (review of Rule 60(b)(1) rulings is for abuse of discretion).\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      *   *   *\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      The district court order against retaliatory action is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings on that issue;  the orders under review are in every other respect affirmed.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      So ordered.\\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 743058}]"},{"id":769669,"date_filed":"2000-07-17","judges":"Martin, Siler, Suhrheinrich","case_name_full":"Boyce A.

Smith $100,000, plus attorney\\'s fees and costs, for wrongful termination of employment based on a jury\\'s finding of racial discrimination. Defendants claim that the district court erred in denying their post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) because there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\\'s finding that race was a substantially motivating factor in Adcom\\'s decision to terminate Smith. Defendants also challenge the jury\\'s finding that Leggett was sufficiently interrelated with Adcom to be held liable for Smith\\'s wrongful termination. Finally, Defendants object to the district court\\'s award of attorney\\'s fees.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      For the following reasons, we REVERSE.\\n    \\n    I.\\n    \\n      3\\n      Boyce A. Smith (\"Smith\"), an African-American, worked as a wire drawing machine operator at Adcom Wire Company (\"Adcom\") in Nicholasville, Kentucky from 1974 until 1994. Adcom is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Missouri-based Leggett &amp; Platt, Inc. (\"Leggett\"). During those years, Smith was paid on an incentive basis depending on his weekly productivity. Adcom considered Smith to be one of the most productive wire drawers in the plant.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      In February 1994, Smith\\'s incentive production numbers began to drop steadily for no apparent reason, resulting in decreases in his weekly paychecks. Smith complained to the plant superintendent, Chip Ford (\"Ford\"). Ford testified that he reviewed Smith\\'s daily production totals and the raw data for his production, checked with the Quality Control Department, reviewed the lab reports on rejects for rejected wire, met with the plant accountant to make sure the calculations were correct, and reviewed the production numbers for other operators working on the same machines to determine if they were consistent. Ford informed Smith that he could not find anything amiss with the calculations.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Smith\\'s production numbers continued to fall over the next month. Smith again complained to Ford, who testified that he could not find anything wrong. On March 16, 1994, Smith told his supervisor, Bobby Guy (\"Guy\"), that he was extremely upset about his incentive calculation. Shortly thereafter, Smith returned to Guy in a rage, and stated that unless his incentive pay was straightened out by the following morning, he, Smith, \"was going to kill a bunch of M.F.s.\" Smith then left the Adcom plant, although he had not completed his shift.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Guy immediately reported the threat to Ford. Ford then reported the incident to the Plant Manager, Steve Riley (\"Riley\"). Riley discussed the matter with Ford and Bill Avise, the Vice President of Operations for the Leggett &amp; Platt wire group, who happened to be visiting the Adcom facility. Ford then met with Guy in person. Ford stated that Guy looked scared, and that, at that point, Ford himself became scared. Ford met with Avise and Riley, and the three agreed that they would talk to Smith the next morning. They also called Nicholasville Police to let them know that an employee had made a threat, and asked that an officer be present the next morning.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      The following morning, Smith returned to work as usual. Ford, Riley, and Avise met with Smith upon his arrival. According to Riley, when asked about the threat, all Smith would say was, \"I might have said that.\" Riley felt that Smith was preoccupied with his incentive calculations. Riley suspended Smith and told him to return the following Monday. Smith left the plant without incident and without an escort. Riley called the police again and asked for a backup. On Monday, March 21, 1994, Adcom terminated Smith.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      On September 11, 1995, Smith sued Leggett, Adcom, and L&amp;P Acquisition Company-8 Inc. in federal court under the Kentucky Civil Right Act, Ky. Rev. St. &#167;&#167; 344.040 et. seq., on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Smith alleged in pertinent part that he suffered unequal treatment while employed at Adcom and that he was terminated because of his race. He also asserted that Defendants engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      Smith testified at trial that co-workers and supervisors regularly made racially discriminatory comments in his presence at work. Smith stated that on his first day of work in 1974, some employees threatened him, stating: \"You\\'re [sic] nigger ass ain\\'t going to work here.\" Smith also testified that on one occasion in the late 1980\\'s or early 1990\\'s, Smith\\'s supervisor Sammy Guy circulated a racially discriminatory and lewd cartoon around the plant. The cartoon depicted an African-American man with a rope around his neck and connected to his penis standing in front of a Caucasian woman. The cartoon was entitled \"How a Black Man Commits Suicide.\" Sometime after 1993, Smith heard his supervisor, Bobby Guy, telling a \"nigger\" joke. Guy admitted using the term. Smith testified also that sometime in the 1990\\'s he heard foreman Ronnie Curry referring to a black employee as a \"gorilla.\" Smith stated that he complained to Curry. Smith also stated that he had \"been to a supervisor once before and my foreman\" to complain about use of the \"N\" word.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      Smith testified that he inquired about promotion and was told that he needed a high school diploma. He later learned that several of the white supervisors did not have high school diplomas. Smith signed up to be promoted in 1990. However, in 1993, Bobby Guy, who is white, received the position even though he had never run a wire drawing machine or set one up. Smith testified that in his twenty years with Adcom, the company never had a black supervisor. Furthermore, Smith offered evidence that Adcom never employed more than four or five blacks at one time, and that between 1992 and 1994, the numbers of black employees was reduced by half through involuntary terminations. Smith also presented statistics showingthat between the years 1989 through 1995, there were no black supervisors at the Leitchfield plant, the Adcom plant, or the Winchester plant. Smith further testified that he thought that he was discharged because for years he had complained about the lack of black supervisors.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Smith also asked the jury to infer discriminatory purpose because other white employees received less severe discipline for offenses similar to Smith\\'s. Employee Willie Reed brought a gun to the plant, but was not terminated. On August 8, 1992, Employee Cecil Hopper, threatened a supervisor with bodily harm, but received only a written warning despite a disciplinary record. On February 1, 1994, employee Jeff Banta heated up a pair of pliers and touched them against a coworker\\'s neck, yet he received only a verbal warning.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Defendants maintained that Smith\\'s threat, not his race, was the reason for his termination. Riley testified that he was concerned about the threat because he knew Smith had guns. As plant manager, Riley stated that he felt an obligation to ensure the safety of all plant employees.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      The district court granted judgment as a matter of law to Defendants on Smith\\'s failure to promote claim and pattern or practice discrimination claim. The jury found that Adcom fired Smith on the basis of race and awarded him $100,000 in damages. Defendants then moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) for a post-verdict judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The district court denied the motion. The court then awarded Smith $135,547.48 in attorney\\'s fees and $2,347.19 in costs and entered a final judgment.\\n    \\n    II.\\n    \\n      14\\n      Defendants argue that the evidence failed to establish that Smith was terminated because of his race. Specifically, Defendants contend Smith did not prove that the proffered reason for Smith\\'s termination - his threat to kill coworkers - was pretext for racial discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      We review a district court\\'s denial of Defendants\\' Rule 50(b) motion de novo. See K&amp;T Enterpr., Inc., v. Zurich Ins. Co., 97 F.3d 171, 175 (6th Cir. 1996). Kentucky law governs the standard of review in this case. See Morales v. American Honda Motor Co., 151 F.3d 500, 506 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that in diversity cases, a state-law standard of review applies when a Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law is based on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence). Under Kentucky law, a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law should be granted only if \"there is a complete absence of proof on a material issue in the action, or if no disputed issue of fact exists upon which reasonable minds could differ.\" Washington v. Goodman, 830 S.W.2d 398, 400 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992); see also Morales, 151 F.3d at 506 (quoting Washington). All reasonable favorable inferences should be drawn in favor of the nonmovant. See Baylis v. Lourdes Hosp., Inc., 805 S.W.2d 122, 125 (Ky. 1991); see also Morales, 151 F.3d at 506 (quoting Baylis).\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Because Ky. Rev. St. Chapter 344 mirrors Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), we use the federal standards for evaluating race discrimination claims. See Kentucky Commission on Human Rights v. Kentucky, 586 S.W.d 270, 271 (Ky. Ct. App. 1979); see also Wathen v. General Elec. Co., 115 F.3d 400, 405 (6th Cir. 1997). Title VII makes unlawful an employer\\'s decision \"to discharge any individual, or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such individual\\'s race, color, religion, sex or national origin[.]\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1) (1994).\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumptionof discrimination by providing evidence showing that the plaintiff was terminated for a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. See Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chem. Co., 29 F.3d 1078, 1092 (6th Cir. 1994). The plaintiff may demonstrate that the defendant\\'s explanation was merely pretext by showing (1) that the proffered reason had no basis in fact, (2) that the proffered reason did not actually motivate the termination, or (3) that the proffered reason was not sufficient to motivate the discharge. See id. at 1084. See generally, Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., __U.S.__, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (holding that a plaintiff\\'s prima facia case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer\\'s asserted justification was false, may permit fact finder to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated).\\n    \\n    A.\\n    \\n      18\\n      Smith\\'s death threat constituted a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for firing him. See, e.g., Lenoir v. Roll Coater, Inc., 13 F.3d 1130, 1132-33 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding that employee\\'s threat to kill two coworkers provided sufficient basis for discharge); Payton v. Runyon, 990 F. Supp. 622, 629 (S.D. Ind. 1997) (holding that employer proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating employee, that he made death threats against his supervisor); Smith v. New York Times, 955 F. Supp. 558, 560 (D. S. C. 1996) (holding that plaintiff\\'s threat to kill supervisor was legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for his discharge), aff\\'d, 107 F.3d 867 (4th Cir. 1997). Smith does not deny making the threatening statement. Furthermore, it was undisputed that Guy believed Smith was irrational and out of control, and that he communicated this feeling to his supervisor, Ford. Because Smith has not proven that the threat was \"factually false,\" he has not established pretext under the first Manzer prong. See Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1084.\\n    \\n    B.\\n    \\n      19\\n      To establish pretext under the second Manzer method, the plaintiff admits the factual basis underlying the discharge and acknowledges that such conduct could motivate the dismissal, but attacks the employer\\'s explanation \"by showing circumstances which tend to prove an illegal motivation was more likely than that offered by the defendant.\" Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1084. \"In other words, the plaintiff argues that the sheer weight of the circumstantial evidence of discrimination makes it \\'more likely than not\\' that the employer\\'s explanation is a pretext, or coverup.\" Id.\\n    \\n    1.\\n    \\n      20\\n      Smith attempted to prove that his threat did not actually motivate his discharge by offering proof of racial statements made by his coworkers. However, none of the racial comments were made by the persons who terminated Smith: Riley, Avise or Ford. \"\\'[S]tatements by nondecisionmakers . . . [can not] suffice to satisfy the plaintiff\\'s burden . . .\\' of demonstrating animus.\" Bush v. Dictaphone Corp., 161 F.3d 363, 369 (6th Cir. 1998) (quoting Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 277 (1989) (O\\'Connor, J., concurring); McDonald v. Union Camp Corp., 898 F.2d 1155, 1161-62 (6th Cir.1990) (holding that statements of intermediate level management officials were not indicative of discrimination when the ultimate decision to discharge is made by an upper-level official); Wilson v. Stroh Cos., Inc., 952 F.2d 942, 945- 46 (6th Cir. 1992) (holding that racial animus by plant manager could not be imputed to upper-level manager who made decision to terminate absent proof of a connection); cf. Talley v. Bravo Pitino Restaurant, Ltd., 61 F.3d 1241, 1249 (6th Cir. 1995) (holding that repeated racial slurs by two owners constituted direct evidence that the plaintiff\\'s termination might have been racially motivated).\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      Further, the stray comments were made long before Smith\\'s termination. See Phelps v. Yale Security, Inc., 986 F.2d 1020, 1025-26 (6th Cir. 1990); see also Russell v. Acme-Evans Co., 51 F.3d 64, 68 (7th Cir. 1995) (holding that threat to shove a shotgun up the plaintiff\\'s \"black ass\" made fifteen years prior to termination decision was \"too tenuously related to the alleged discriminatory action by supervisors many years later\" to create an inference of discrimination). Thus, the stray remarks were not relevant. See Ercegovich v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 154 F.3d 344, 354 (6th Cir. 1998) (\"In assessing the relevancy of a discriminatory remark, we look first at the identity of the speaker. An isolated discriminatory remark made by one with no managerial authority over the challenged personnel decisions is not considered indicative of . . . discrimination.\"); cf. Robinson v. Runyon, 149 F.3d 507, 512 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that evidence showing that coemployees circulated a fake employment application incorporating racial stereotypes was relevant where the plaintiff showed that upper management knew of the application, but did not condemn it).\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      Nor can we say that the error was harmless. The derogatory and graphic racial comments in this case are the \"smoking gun\" type evidence that added an \"emotional element\" as a basis for a verdict. See Schrand v. Federal Pacific Elec. Co., 851 F.2d 152, 156 (6th Cir. 1988) (age-related comments by nondecisionmakers was not relevant, \"embellished the circumstantial evidence directed to that issue by adding \\'smoking gun\\' type evidence,\" and \"offered an emotional element that was otherwise lacking as a basis for a verdict\" for the plaintiff). The district court committed reversible error in admitting the evidence. See id. 851 F.2d at 157 (holding that district court committed clear error in admitting \"too old\" statements, warranting reversal).\\n    \\n    2.\\n    \\n      23\\n      Smith also claims that the discriminatory remarks, viewed collectively, establish that Defendants tolerated a racially hostile atmosphere.1 In order to establish a racially hostile work environment under Title VII, the plaintiff must show that the conduct in question was severe or pervasive enough to create an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and that the victim subjectively regarded it as abusive. See Jackson v. Quanex Corp., 191 F.3d 647, 658-59 (6th Cir. 1999); see also Burnett v. Tyco Corp., 203 F.3d 980, 982-83 (6th Cir. Feb. 11, 2000). The plaintiff must also prove that his employer \"tolerated or condoned the situation,\" or knew or should have known of the alleged conduct and did nothing to correct the situation. See Jackson, 191 F.3d at 659.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      Smith\\'s evidence - a racial slur in 1974 by an unknown coworker, a racially offensive and obscene cartoon passed around in the late 1980\\'s or early 1990\\'s by one who was not involved in Smith\\'s termination decision, Bobby Guy\\'s racist joke sometime after 1993, and supervisor Ronnie Curry\\'s reference to a black employee as a \"gorilla\" - is simply not \"severe or pervasive enough\" to create an objectively hostile work environment. Racial animus cannot be inferred from a handful of discriminatory comments by low-level employees, most of which were not directed at Smith, over a twenty-year span of time. See Burnett, 203 F.3d at 984-85 (holding that the occurrence of three sexually offensive remarks by the plaintiff\\'s personnel manager spread out at the beginning and at the end of a six-month period were notcommonplace, ongoing, or continuing and therefore not pervasive discriminatory conduct); Black v. Zaring Homes, Inc., 104 F.3d 822, 826 (6th Cir. 1997) (reversing a jury verdict although the plaintiff alleged various discriminatory comments made consistently over a four-month period, because viewed under the totality of the circumstances the comments were merely offensive, and most were not directed at the plaintiff). Cf. Jackson, 191 F.3d at 658 (finding a racially hostile work environment where plaintiff established persistent racial slurs and graffiti as \"conventional conditions on the factory floor\"); Williams v. General Motor Corp, 187 F.3d 553, 562-66 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that fifteen separate allegations of persistent foul language and sexually explicit comments directed at the plaintiff, three of which involved an \"element of physical invasion,\" offensive comments towards women in general, denial of the plaintiff\\'s overtime, viewed collectively, created issue of fact that the plaintiff was subject to a sexually hostile work environment); Abeita v. Transamerica Mailings, 159 F.3d 246, 252 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that the plaintiff\\'s allegations of sexually offensive statements that were commonplace and ongoing over a period of seven years, coupled with daily statements by the president of the company, with whom the plaintiff worked closely, about his sexual interest in female employees and models, created fact question of sexually hostile work environment);  Ercegovich, 154 F.3d at 356 (holding that isolated comment by senior official \"evidencing managerial policy,\" when coupled with numerous discriminatory comments by individuals occupying high positions might \"reflect a cumulative managerial attitude among the defendant-employer\\'s managers that has influenced the decisionmaking process for a considerable time\").\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      Nor is there any proof, direct or indirect, that Defendants \"tolerated or condoned\" the racial harassment. See Jackson, 191 F.3d at 659. With one exception, it was undisputed that Riley, Ford, and Avise were not aware of the alleged incidents. Smith testified simply that he complained to a supervisor about a racial comment only once. Riley testified, without contradiction, that after Smith spoke to him, Riley warned the employee that he would be disciplined, possibly terminated for any further racial comments. Smith\\'s vague assertion that there was a general attitude of discrimination at Adcom is insufficient to establish pretext. See Wixson v. Dowagiac Nursing Home, 87 F.3d 164, 171 (6th Cir. 1996) (holding that the plaintiffs failed to create issue of fact by alleging numerous instances of disparate treatment and hostile work environment in conclusory terms with no reference to names, times, occasions). Thus, absent proof that Defendants condoned severe or pervasive racial harassment, Smith failed to show discrimination based on a racially hostile work environment. Cf. Ercegovich, 154 F.3d at 356 (holding that numerous age-related statements by management reflected a corporate mindset or discriminatory atmosphere).\\n    \\n    3.\\n    \\n      26\\n      Over Defendants\\' objections, Smith also introduced statistics relating to the percentage of minority supervisors at Adcom and at Leggett\\'s other Kentucky facilities in Leitchfield, Simpsonville, and Winchester to show pretext under the second Manzer prong. Admission of this evidence was likewise erroneous, and not harmless. First, Smith\\'s statistics were not admissible because he did not establish the number of qualified minorities available in each labor market. See Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 650 (1989); Gibson v. Frank, 946 F.2d 1229, 1233 (6th Cir. 1991) (holding that the plaintiff failed to show discrimination because he did not demonstrate the proportion of blacks qualified for the position); Simpson v. Midland-Ross Corp., 823 F.2d 937, 943 (6th Cir. 1987) (employee statistics unaccompanied by evidence regarding qualifiedpotential from the relevant \"employee statistics unaccompanied by evidence regarding qualified potential applicants from the relevant labor market\" lack probative value). Furthermore, the statistics relating to the percentage of minority supervisors at Adcom and other Leggett &amp; Platt facilities were not relevant to the issue of whether Adcom terminated Smith because of his race. See Kier v. Commercial Union Ins. Cos., 808 F.2d 1254, 1258 (7th Cir. 1987) (holding that statistical evidence relating to the employer\\'s hiring practices is irrelevant in discriminatory discharge case); Box v. A&amp;P Tea Co., 772 F.2d 1372, 1379-80 (7th Cir. 1985) (statistics showing that the employer favored men in promotions had little relevance to claim that the employer discriminated because of sex in discipline). Smith\\'s statistics lacked probative value and could not support a jury verdict on the ultimate question of discrimination.\\n    \\n    4.\\n    \\n      27\\n      Smith also contends that the jury could have inferred racial animus from Defendants\\' purported lack of fear to Smith\\'s threat. We note that both Guy and Ford testified that they were afraid of Smith after he made the threat. In any event, the issue before us is not whether Defendants exercised good judgment in firing Smith, but merely whether they did so because of an illicit motive. See Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1085. Absent some evidence of racial discrimination, Smith failed to meet his burden.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      Smith\\'s suggestion that Adcom\\'s failure to promote him to the position of production supervisor is also insufficient to carry his burden. First, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law as to Smith\\'s failure to promote claim. Further, the jury could not reasonably conclude that Smith was fired based upon the fact that Smith was not promoted to the position of facilitator five years earlier. Finally, the allegedly false statement concerning the need for a high school diploma was not relevant because it was made nine years before Smith\\'s termination.\\n    \\n    C.\\n    \\n      29\\n      Smith also tried to establish pretext under the third Manzer prong by demonstrating that he was treated differently than similarly situated employees. This type of evidence \"consists of evidence that other employees, particularly employees not in the protected class, were not fired even though they engaged in substantially identical conduct to that which the employer contends motivated its discharge of the plaintiff.\" Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1084. To be similarly situated, \"the individuals with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare his\/her treatment must have dealt with the same supervisor, have been subject to the same standards and have engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer\\'s treatment of them for it.\" Ercegovich, 154 F.3d at 352 (quoting Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp., 964 F.2d 577, 583 (6th Cir. 1992)). Exact correlation is not required, however. See id. Rather, \"the plaintiff and the employee with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare himself or herself must be similar in \\'all of the relevant aspects.\\'\" Ercegovich, 154 F.3d at 352 (quoting Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., 40 F.3d 796, 802 (6th Cir. 1994)); see also Harrison v. Metro Government, 80 F.3d 1107, 1115 (6th Cir. 1996) (noting that \"precise equivalence in culpability between employees\" is not required when comparing similarly situated, non-minority employees).\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      As evidence of disparate treatment, Smith attempted to compare himself to coworkers Reed, Hopper, and Banta. The comparisons are inapt however, because Smith was disciplined by a different decisionmaker and engaged in different conduct than Reed, Hopper and Banta. See Ercegovich, 154 F.3d at 352; Mitchell, 964 F.3d at 583.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      Reed, Banta and Hopper were not \"similarly situated\" as a matter of law. Riley, who made the decision to fire Smith, did not determine their discipline. Ralph Lutz, who was plant manager for a time, disciplined Reed and Hopper. Although Riley signed Hopper\\'s disciplinary form, it was undisputed that Riley referred the matter to Lutz, and that Lutz determined the punishment. Lutz was not even employed at Adcom when Riley terminated Smith. Ford, not Riley, made the decision to give Banta a verbal warning.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      Smith\\'s conduct is also dissimilar to Reed\\'s, Hopper\\'s, and Banta\\'s. Riley testified that he terminated Smith because of his threat to \"blow away some MFers\" if his incentive pay was not increased. Riley testified that as plant manager, he was concerned about plant safety. This is clearly a \"mitigating circumstance\" that prevents any comparison with Reed\\'s, Hopper\\'s, and Banta\\'s significantly less threatening conduct, as determined by Defendants. Reed brought a handgun to work to protect himself against threats from a former Adcom employee. Reed did not show the gun to any other Adcom employees; it was discovered by a cleaning person. Lutz gave the handgun to Reed\\'s wife (who also worked at the plant) and told her to tell Reed not to bring it back again. Lutz testified that because no one was threatened at the plant, he decided to keep the matter \"low key\" and not report it to the corporate office. Hopper invited his supervisor, Bill Grimes, to meet him off property, presumably to fight. Lutz decided to give Hopper merely a verbal warning because he felt, \"under the circumstances, he didn\\'t do any damage.\" Although Banta stuck a pair of heated pliers on a coworkers neck, Ford gave merely a verbal warning because the employees were \"horseplaying,\" and Ford felt that Banta \"didn\\'t intentionally mean to hurt someone.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      In short, neither Reed, Hopper or Banta threatened random, plant-wide violence. Furthermore, it is inappropriate for the judiciary to substitute its judgment for that of management. See Krenik v. County of Le Sueur, 47 F.3d 953, 960 (8th Cir. 1995) (holding that court cannot sit as a \"super-personnel department\"); Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 939 F.3d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir. 1991) (same); see also Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1085 (holding that \"\\'just-cause\\' arguments must not be allowed to creep into an employment discrimination lawsuit\"). Smith failed to show that he was treated differently than similarly-situated, non-minority employees. The district court erred in admitting this evidence.\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      In sum, there was insufficient evidence to find that Defendants proffered reason for firing Smith was pretextual. Given the \"complete absence of proof\" on the material issue of racial animus in this case, the district court should have granted Defendants\\' motion for judgment as a matter of law. Furthermore, because the remaining, properly admitted evidence is insufficient to shoulder Smith\\'s burden of proof, we now direct an entry of judgment as a matter of law for Defendants. See Weisgram v. Marley Co., - U.S. - , 120 S.Ct. 1011. 1021-22, 145 L.Ed.2d 958 (February 22, 2000).\\n    \\n    III.\\n    \\n      35\\n      Given this outcome, Defendants\\' remaining claims regarding attorney\\'s fees and corporate interrelationship are moot.\\n    \\n    IV.\\n    \\n      36\\n      For the foregoing reasons, the district court\\'s judgment in favor of Smith is REVERSED, and judgment as a matter of law is entered for Defendants.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        Notes:\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         The district court granted judgment as a matter of law on Smith\\'s pattern or practice discrimination claim. Smith does not challenge that ruling on appeal. Rather, on appeal he argues that the alleged racially hostile atmosphere is proper circumstantial evidence that the proffered reason did not actually motivate his discharge. We therefore evaluate this evidence under the second Manzer prong.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      BOYCE F. MARTIN, JR., Chief Judge, dissenting.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      We have here the question of whether Smith provided sufficient evidence to support the jury\\'s finding that a racially hostile work environment was present at the plant and that race was a substantially motivating factor in Adcom\\'s decision toterminate Smith. The majority holds that such evidence of racism, if examined under the Supreme Court\\'s \"totality of the circumstances\" test established in Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993), was not sufficient to overcome Adcom\\'s post-verdict motion for judgement as a matter of law. In addition, the majority concludes that Smith\\'s statement that \"he was going to kill a bunch of M--F---ers\" constituted a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for firing him, and that Smith failed to establish that this reason was pretextual. I must respectfully dissent.\\n    \\n    I.\\n    \\n      39\\n      In Harris, the Supreme Court held that courts reviewing a hostile work environment claim should consider \"all of the circumstances,\" including the \"frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\\'s performance.\" According to the Court, \"the conduct in question must be severe or pervasive enough to create an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and the victim must subjectively regard that environment as abusive.\" Id. at 21-22. Moreover, the plaintiff must also prove that his employer \"tolerated or condoned the situation\" or knew or should have known of the alleged conduct and did nothing to correct the situation. See Jackson v. Quanex Corp., 191 F.3d 647, 659 (6th Cir. 1999). The Supreme Court in Harris acknowledged that determining whether a work environment is objectively hostile or abusive is not a \"mathematically precise test.\" Id.\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      In this case, the majority finds that the circulation of a racially discriminatory and lewd cartoon by a supervisor around the plant, the use of the \"N\" word and other racially demeaning terms by fellow employees and supervisors in the presence of Smith on more than one occasion, and disparate treatment concerning disciplinary measures imposed on other white employees at the plant for comparable offenses were not \"severe or pervasive enough\" to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an objectively hostile work environment existed at the plant. In reaching this conclusion, the majority fails to recognize this Court\\'s decision in Williams v. General Motors Corp, 187 F.3d 553 (6th Cir. 1999). In Williams, we reversed the district court\\'s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff alleged multiple acts creating a hostile work environment: foul language, sexual comments directed at plaintiff, at least one incident of physical contact, perceived inequities of treatment, and pranks or annoying conduct by co-workers.  See id. at 559, 562. We held the district court erred in its dismissal of these incidents as \"\\'infrequent, not severe, not threatening or humiliating, but merely offensive.\\'\" Id. at 563. We found the district court failed to consider the totality of the circumstances and thereby \"robbed the incidents of their cumulative effect.\" Id. at 561.\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      Similar to our holding in Williams, the majority\\'s opinion in this case robs the incidents of racism presented by Smith of their cumulative effect. All that Smith is required to show is that the conduct in question was severe or pervasive enough to create an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and that he subjectively regarded that environment as abusive. This is a subjective, not an objective, test. Smith had worked at the plant for nearly twenty years. Over the years, he was exposed to a number of racially motivated acts and remarks. Some of the misconduct was directed at him, and some was not. The majority concludes that because each instance of racism was spread out over a twenty year period, no reasonable employee could subjectively view the atmosphere at the plant as racially hostile or abusive. I disagree on the basis of this Court\\'s reasoning in Ercegovich v. Goodyear Tire &amp; RubberCo., 154 F.3d 344, 354-55 (6th Cir. 1998), whereby we said that evidence of a corporate state of mind or discriminatory atmosphere is not rendered irrelevant by its failure to coincide precisely with the particular \"time-frame involved in the specific events that generated a claim of discriminatory treatment.\" Discriminatory statements may reflect a cumulative managerial attitude among the defendant-employers\\' supervisors that has influenced the decision-making process for a considerable period of time. See id.\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      In addition, the majority seems to be establishing that unless racially motivated misconduct is aimed at the plaintiff directly, simply seeing or overhearing it targeted at another is not sufficient to label the misconduct as \"severe.\" We have held that evidence of racist remarks or isolated incidences of racial conduct directed towards other African-American employees at the plant may be critical for the jury\\'s assessment of whether a given employer was more likely than not to have acted from an unlawful motive. See Robinson v. Runyon, 149 F.3d 507, 513 (6th Cir. 1998). An employer may create a hostile environment for an employee even where it directs its discriminatory acts or practices at the protected group of which the plaintiff is a member, and not just at the plaintiff himself. See Jackson v. Quanex Corp., 191 F.3d 647 (6th Cir. 1999). Thus, the fact that Smith was not the targeted victim of a racial remark made by a supervisor does not mean that such a remark was not offensive or humiliating to Smith. The jury was entitled to factor such remarks into their decision.\\n    \\n    \\n      43\\n      I believe that the Supreme Court did not intend for us to interpret the \"totality of the circumstances\" test so narrowly by disaggregating the effect of each incident over time until its significance is lost or diluted. Instead, we should look more at the cumulative effect of these incidents over time in order to assess whether the atmosphere at the plant was racially hostile from plaintiff\\'s subjective point of view. The district court found that evidence of racial slurs and the offensive cartoon coupled with a lack of an effective disciplinary response to each incident over the years constituted a sufficient basis on which a reasonable jury could find that Smith was subjected to a racially hostile work environment. This finding was not unreasonable given the standard of review in this case, which states that a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law should not be granted unless there is a \"complete absence of proof on a material issue in the action.\" See Morales v. American Honda Motor Co., 151 F.3d 500, 506 (6th Cir. 1998). By reversing the lower court\\'s decision and granting Adcom its post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law, this Court fails to draw \"all reasonable favorable inferences in favor of the nonmovant. See id. Accordingly, I disagree with the majority\\'s decision to grant judgment to the defendant in this case on the basis that Smith did not provide sufficient evidence under the \"totality of the circumstances.\" I think the test is for a jury to find that his termination was racially motivated. I would at least give him a new trial.\\n    \\n    II.\\n    \\n      44\\n      The majority also holds that Smith\\'s remark in the presence of Bobby Guy that he \"was going to kill a bunch of M--F---ers\", which he does not deny making, constituted a threat against the company and a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for firing him. The majority concludes that because Smith failed to prove that his threat did not actually motivate his discharge or was pretext, he was not entitled to a decision in his favor on Adcom\\'s post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law.\\n    \\n    \\n      45\\n      Pretext is established by evidence showing that the legitimate reason claimed by the defendant for a particular action is not the true reason, but instead is a pretext for discrimination. See St. Mary\\'s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 50 U.S. 502, 515 (1993). The plaintiff may demonstrate pretext by showing that (1) the defendant\\'s proffered reason had no basis in fact, (2) the proffered reason did not actually motivate the termination, or (3) the proffered reason was not sufficient to motivate the discharge. See Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chem., 29 F.3d 1078, 1084 (6th Cir. 1994).\\n    \\n    \\n      46\\n      In this case, Smith does not dispute that he made the threatening remark under the first prong of the Manzer test or the fact that such a remark, under certain circumstances, would be a sufficient nondiscriminatory reason for firing someone under the third Manzer prong. However, under the third prong, there is a real dispute as to whether Smith\\'s threat was directed toward any employee of the company or whether anyone at the plant took Smith\\'s threat seriously. Moreover, there is no explanation as to why there was no direct law enforcement the day after the threat was made or why the employer waited until Monday to fire Smith. These are disputed issues, which in my opinion, are questions of fact for a jury, not the court, to decide.\\n    \\n    \\n      47\\n      Under the second prong of the Manzer test, Smith seeks to show that \"the sheer weight of the circumstantial evidence of discrimination makes it more likely than not that the employer\\'s explanation is pretext.\" Id. at 1084. Smith produces evidence of racism and unequal treatment over a twenty year period to show that a racially hostile work environment existed at the plant. The district court allowed such evidence to go to a jury so that the jury could decide whether Smith was fired because of the threat or discriminatory reasons. The majority incorrectly dismisses this evidence on the grounds that none of the racial comments were made by the persons who terminated Smith and most of the comments were made long before Smith\\'s termination. Again, it is important to reiterate this Court\\'s language in Ercegovich that evidence of a corporate state of mind or discriminatory atmosphere is not rendered irrelevant by its failure to coincide precisely with the particular actors or time-frame involved in the specific events that generated a claim of discriminatory treatment. Ercegovich, at 354-55. Thus, although discriminatory statements by a non-decision maker, standing alone, generally do not support an inference of discrimination, such statements are not categorically excluded. See id.\\n    \\n    \\n      48\\n      Finally, the majority writes that the evidence of racism Smith produced in this case should not have reached a jury because such evidence added an \"emotional element\" as a basis for the verdict. Being that this is a race discrimination case brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and given that the crux of Smith\\'s case depends upon the production of evidence showing that he was fired for racial reasons, it is inconceivable to me that the majority would argue that evidence of racism at the plant should have been excluded for its alleged \"emotional\" impact on the jury. The district court allowed such evidence to go to the jury because it was both critical and relevant to Smith\\'s claims. Thus, in my view, the district court did not commit reversible error in admitting the evidence.\\n    \\n    III.\\n    \\n      49\\n      In sum, I believe that the district court did not err when it allowed evidence of racial remarks and conduct by supervisors and employees toward Smith and other African-American employees at Adcom to go to the jury. Under the \"totality of the circumstances\" approach set forth in Harris, the frequency and severity of the discriminatory behavior among supervisors and employees were indicative of the racially hostile work environment at Adcom over an extended period of time. On one occasion, Smith was shown a lewd and racist cartoon by his supervisor that depicted African-Americans in a humiliating light. On other occasions, Smith was called a \"nigger\" by a fellow white employeean employee who merely received a verbal reprimand for the remark by Smith\\'s supervisor - and was present while a racially offensive joke was being told by a supervisor. According to Smith and other fellow employees, the use of the \"N\" word was commonplace at the plant and Smith was often present when the term was used. Such remarks constitute more than \"mere offensive utterances\" and are indicative of the racially hostile atmosphere at Adcom. Moreover, Smith, in my opinion, satisfied his evidentiary burden for a reasonable jury to find that the employer\\'s explanation for firing him was pretext under the second and third prongs of the Manzer test.\\n    \\n    \\n      50\\n      Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 769669}, {'author_str': 'Suhrheinrich', 'per_curiam': False, 'type': '020lead', 'page_count': None, 'download_url': None, 'author_id': None, 'opinion_text': \"\\nSUHRHEINRICH, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which SILER, J., joined.

Smith $100,-000, plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs, for wrongful termination of employment based on a jury\u2019s finding of racial discrimination. Defendants claim that the district court erred in denying their post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) because there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that race was a substantially motivating factor in Adcom\u2019s decision to terminate Smith. Defendants also challenge the jury\u2019s finding that Leggett was sufficiently interrelated with Adcom to be held hable for Smith\u2019s wrongful termination. Finally, Defendants object to the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.\\nFor the following reasons, we REVERSE:\\nI. '\\nBoyce A. Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d), an African-American, worked as a wire drawing machine operator at Adcom Wire Company (\u201cAdcom\u201d) in Nicholasville, Kentucky from 1974 until 1994. Adcom is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Missouri-based Leggett &amp; Platt, Inc. (\u201cLeggett\u201d). During those years, Smith was paid on an incentive basis depending on his weekly productivity. Adcom considered Smith to be one of the most productive wire drawers in the plant.\\nIn February. 1994, Smith\u2019s incentive production numbers began to drop steadily for no apparent reason, resulting in decreases in his weekly paychecks. Smith complained to the plant superintendent, Chip Ford (\u201cFord\u201d). Ford testified that he reviewed.Smith\u2019s daily production totals and the raw data for his production, checked with the Quality Control Department, reviewed the lab reports on rejects for rejected wire, met with the plant accountant to make sure the calculations were correct, and reviewed the production numbers for other operators working on the same machines to determine if they were consistent. Ford informed Smith that he could not find anything amiss with the calculations.\\n*757Smith\u2019s production numbers continued to fall over the next month. Smith again complained to Ford, who testified that he could not find anything wrong. On March 16, 1994, Smith told his supervisor, Bobby Guy (\u201cGuy\u201d), that he was extremely upset about his incentive calculation. Shortly thereafter, Smith returned to Guy in a rage, and stated that unless his incentive pay was straightened out by the following morning, he, Smith, \u201cwas going to kill a bunch of M.F.s.\u201d Smith then left the Ad-com plant, although he had not completed his shift.\\nGuy immediately reported the threat to Ford. Ford then reported the incident to the Plant Manager, Steve Riley (\u201cRiley\u201d). Riley discussed the matter with Ford and Bill Avise, the Vice President of Operations for the Leggett &amp; Platt wire group, who happened to be visiting the Adcom facility. Ford then met with Guy in person. Ford stated that Guy looked scared, and that, at that point, Ford himself became scared. Ford met with Avise and Riley, and the three agreed that they would talk to Smith the next morning. They also called Nicholasville Police to let them know that an employee had made a threat, and asked that an officer be present the next morning.\\nThe following morning, Smith returned to work as usual. Ford, Riley, and Avise met with Smith upon his arrival. According to Riley, when asked about the threat, all Smith would say was, \u201cI might have said that.\u201d Riley felt that Smith was preoccupied with his incentive \u2019calculations. Riley suspended Smith and told him to return the following Monday. Smith left the plant without incident and without an escort. Riley called the police again and asked for a backup. On Monday, March 21, 1994, Adcom terminated Smith.\\nOn September 11, 1995, Smith sued Leggett, Adcom, and L &amp; P Acquisition Company-8 Inc. in federal court under the Kentucky Civil Rights Act, Ky. Rev. St. \u00a7\u00a7 344.040 et. seq., on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Smith alleged in pertinent part that he suffered unequal treatment while employed at Adcom and that he was terminated because of his race. He also asserted that Defendants engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination.\\nSmith testified at trial that co-workers and supervisors regularly made racially discriminatory comments in his presence at work. Smith stated that on his first day, of work in 1974, some employees threatened him, stating: \u201cYou\u2019re [sic] nigger ass ain\u2019t going to work here.\u201d Smith also testified that .on one occasion in the late 1980\u2019s or early 1990\u2019s, Smith\u2019s supervisor Sammy Guy circulated a racially discriminatory and lewd cartoon around the plant. The cartoon depicted an African-American man with a rope around his neck and connected to his pfenis standing in front of a Caucasian woman. The cartoon was entitled \u201cHow a Black Man Commits Suicide.\u201d Sometime after 1993, Smith heard his supervisor, Bobby Guy, telling a \u201cnigger\u201d joke. Guy admitted using the term. Smith testified also that sometime in the 1990\u2019s he heard foreman Ronnie Curry referring to a black employee as a \u201cgorilla.\u201d Smith stated that he complained to Curry. Smith also stated that he had \u201cbeen to a supervisor once before and my foreman\u201d to complain'about use of the \u201cN\u201d word.\\nSmith testified that he inquired about promotion and was told that he needed a high school diploma. He later learned that several of the white supervisors did not have \u2019high school diplomas. Smith signed up to be promoted in 1990. However, in 1993, Bobby Guy, who is white, received the position even though he had never run a wire drawing machine or set one up. Smith testified that in his twenty years with Adcom, the company never had a black supervisor. Furthermore, Smith offered evidence that Adcom never employed more than four or five blacks at one time, and that between 1992 and 1994, the numbers of black employees was reduced by half through involuntary terminations. Smith also presented statistics showing *760Further, the stray comments were made long before Smith\u2019s termination. See Phelps v. Yale Security, Inc., 986 F.2d 1020, 1025-26 (6th Cir.1993); see also Russell v. Acme-Evans Co., 51 F.3d 64, 68 (7th Cir.1995) (holding that threat to shove a shotgun up the plaintiffs \u201cblack ass\u201d made fifteen years prior to termination decision was \u201ctoo tenuously related to the alleged discriminatory action by supervisors many years later\u201d to create an inference of discrimination). Thus, the stray remarks were not relevant. See Ercegovich v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 154 F.3d 344, 354 (6th Cir.1998) (\u201cIn assessing the relevancy of a discriminatory remark, we look first at the identity of the speaker. An isolated discriminatory remark made by one with no managerial authority over the challenged personnel decisions is not considered indicative of ... discrimination.\u201d); cf. Robinson v. Runyon, 149 F.3d 507, 512 (6th Cir.1998) (holding that evidence showing that co-employees circulated a fake employment application incorporating racial stereotypes was relevant where the plaintiff showed that upper management knew of the application, but did not condemn it). *758that between the years 1989 through 1995, there were no black supervisors at the Leitchfield plant, the Adcom plant, or the Winchester plant. Smith further testified that he thought that he was discharged because for years he had complained about the lack of black supervisors.\\nSmith also asked the jury to infer discriminatory purpose because other white employees received less severe discipline for offenses similar to Smith\u2019s. Employee Willie Reed brought a gun to the plant, but was not terminated. On August 8, 1992, Employee Cecil Hopper, threatened a supervisor with bodily harm, but received only a written warning despite a disciplinary record. On February 1, 1994, employee Jeff Banta heated up a pair of pliers and touched them against a coworker\u2019s neck, yet he received only a verbal warning.\\nDefendants maintained that Smith\u2019s threat, not his race, was the reason for his termination. Riley\u2019 testified that he was concerned about the threat because he knew Smith had guns. As plant manager, Riley stated that he ,felt an obligation to ensure the safety of all plant employees.\\nThe district court granted judgment as a matter of law to Defendants on Smith\u2019s failure to promote claim and pattern or practice discrimination claim. .The jury found that Adcom fired Smith on the basis of race and awarded him $100,000 in damages. Defendants then moved pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) for a post-verdict judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The district court denied the motion. The court then awarded Smith $135,547.48 in attorney\u2019s fees and $2,347.19 in costs and entered a final judgment.\\nII.\\nDefendants argue that the evidence failed to establish that Smith was terminated because of his race. Specifically, Defendants contend Smith did not prove that the proffered reason for Smith\u2019s termination\u2014his threat to kill coworkers\u2014 was pretext for racial discrimination.\\nWe review a district court\u2019s denial of Defendants\u2019 Rule 50(b) motion de novo. See K&amp;T Enterpr., Inc., v. Zurich Ins. Co., 97 F.3d 171, 175 (6th Cir.1996). Kentucky law governs the standard of review in this case. See Morales v. American Honda Motor Co., 151 F.3d 500, 506 (6th Cir.1998) (holding that in diversity cases, a state-law standard of review applies when a Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law is based on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence). Under Kentucky law, a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law should be granted only if \u201cthere is a complete absence of proof on a material issue in the action, or if no disputed issue of fact exists upon which reasonable minds could differ.\u201d Washington v. Goodman, 830 S.W.2d 398, 400 (Ky.Ct.App.1992); see also Morales, 151 F.3d at 506 (quoting Washington). All reasonable favorable inferences should be drawn in favor of the nonmovant. See Baylis v. Lourdes Hosp., Inc., 805 S.W.2d 122, 125 (Ky.1991); see also Morales, 151 F.3d at 506 (quoting Baylis).\\nBecause Ky. Rev. St. Chapter 344 mirrors Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), we use the federal standards for evaluating race discrimination claims. See Kentucky Commission on Human Rights v. Kentucky, 586 S.W.2d 270, 271 (Ky.Ct.App.1979); see also Wathen v. General Elec. Co., 115 F.3d 400, 405 (6th Cir.1997). Title VII makes unlawful an employer\u2019s decision \u201cto discharge any individual, or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex or national origin[.]\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) (1994).\\nOnce a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the pre*759sumption of discrimination by providing evidence showing that the plaintiff was terminated for a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. See Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chem. Co., 29 F.3d 1078, 1082 (6th Cir.1994). The plaintiff may demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s explanation Mias merely pretext by showing (1) that the proffered reason had no basis in fact, (2) that the proffered reason did not actually motivate the termination, or (3)' that the proffered reason was not sufficient to motivate the discharge. See id. at 1084. See generally, Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., \u2014 U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (holding that a plaintiffs prima facia case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer\u2019s asserted justification was false, may permit fact finder to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated).\\nA.\\nSmith\u2019s death threat constituted a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for firing him. See, e.g., Lenoir v. Roll Coater, Inc., 13 F.3d 1130, 1132-33 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that employee\u2019s threat to kill two coworkers provided sufficient basis for discharge); Payton v. Runyon, 990 F.Supp. 622, 629 (S.D.Ind.1997) (holding that employer proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating employee, that he made death threats against his supervisor); Smith v. New York Times, 955 F.Supp. 558, 560 (D.S.C.1996) (holding that plaintiffs threat to kill supervisor was legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for his discharge), aff'd, 107 F.3d 867 (4th Cir.1997). Smith does not deny making the threatening statement. Furthermore, it was undisputed that Guy believed Smith was irrational and out of control, and that he communicated this feeling to his supervisor, Ford. Because Smith has not proven that the threat was '\u2018factually false,\u201d he has not established pretext under the first Manzer prong. See Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1084.\\nB.\\nTo establish pretext under the second Manzer method, the plaintiff admits the factual basis underlying the discharge and acknowledges that such conduct could motivate the dismissal, but attacks the employer\u2019s explanation \u201cby showing circumstances which tend to prove an illegal motivation was more likely than that offered by the defendant.\u201d Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1084. \u201cIn other words, the plaintiff argues that the sheer weight of the circumstantial evidence of discrimination makes it \u2018more likely than not\u2019 that the employer\u2019s explanation is a pretext, or coverup.\u201d Id.\\n1.\\nSmith attempted to prove that his threat did not actually motivate his discharge by offering proof of racial statements made by his coworkers. However, none of the racial comments were made by the persons who terminated Smith: Riley, Avise or Ford. \u201c \u2018[S]tatements by nondeci-sionmakers ... [can not] suffice to satisfy the plaintiffs burden .\u2019 of demonstrating animus.\u201d Bush v. Dictaphone Corp., 161 F.3d 363, 369 (6th Cir.1998) (quoting Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 277, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)); McDonald v. Union Camp Corp., 898 F.2d 1155, 1161-62 (6th Cir.1990) (holding that statements of intermediate level management officials were not indicative of discrimination when the ultimate decision to discharge is made by an upper-level official); Wilson v. Stroh Cos., Inc., 952 F.2d 942, 945-46 (6th Cir.1992) (holding that racial animus by plant manager could not be imputed to upper-level manager who made decision to terminate absent proof of a connection); cf. Talley v. Bravo Pitino Restaurant, Ltd., 61 F.3d 1241, 1249 (6th Cir.1995) (holding that repeated racial slurs by two owners constituted direct evidence that the plaintiffs termination might have been racially motivated).\\n*760Nor can we say that the error was harmless. The derogatory and graphic racial comments in this case are the \u201csmoking gun\u201d type evidence that added an \u201cemotional element\u201d as a basis for a verdict. See Schrand v. Federal Pacific Elec. Co., 851 F.2d 152, 156 (6th Cir.1988) (age-related comments by nondecisionmakers was not relevant, \u201cembellished the circumstantial evidence directed to that issue by adding \u2018smoking gun\u2019 type evidence,\u201d and \u201coffered an emotional element that was otherwise lacking as a basis for a verdict\u201d for the plaintiff). The district court committed reversible error in admitting the evidence. See id. 851 F.2d at 157 (holding that district court committed clear error in admitting \u201ctoo old\u201d statements, warranting reversal).\\n2.\\nSmith also claims that the discriminatory remarks, viewed collectively, establish that Defendants tolerated a racially hostile atmosphere.1 In order to establish a racially hostile work environment under Title VII, the plaintiff must show that the conduct in question was severe or pervasive enough to create an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and that the victim subjectively regarded it as abusive. See Jackson v. Quanex Corp., 191 F.3d 647, 658-59 (6th Cir.1999); see also Burnett v. Tyco Corp., 203 F.3d 980, 982-83 (6th Cir.2000). The plaintiff must also prove that his employer \u201ctolerated or condoned the situation,\u201d or knew or should have known of the alleged conduct and did nothing to correct the situation. See Jackson, 191 F.3d at 659.\\nSmith\u2019s evidence\u2014a racial slur in 1974 by an unknown coworker, a racially offensive and obscene cartoon passed around in the late 1980\u2019s or early 1990\u2019s by one who was not involved in Smith\u2019s termination decision, Bobby Guy\u2019s racist joke sometime after 1993, and supervisor Ronnie Curry\u2019s reference to a black employee as a \u201cgorilla\u201d\u2014is simply not \u201csevere or pervasive enough\u201d to create an objectively hostile work environment. Racial animus cannot be inferred from a handful of discriminatory comments by low-level employees, most of which were not directed at Smith, over a twenty-year span of time. See Burnett, 203 F.3d at 984-85 (holding that the occurrence of three sexually offensive remarks by the plaintiffs personnel manager spread out at the beginning and at the end of a six-month period were not *761commonplace, ongoing, or continuing and therefore not pervasive discriminatory conduct); Black v. Zaring Homes, Inc., 104 F.3d 822, 826 (6th Cir.1997) (reversing a jury verdict although the plaintiff alleged various discriminatory comments made consistently over a four-month period, because viewed under the totality of the circumstances the comments were merely offensive, and most were not directed at the plaintiff). Cf. Jackson, 191 F.3d at 658 (finding a racially hostile work environment where plaintiff established persistent racial slurs and graffiti as \u201cconventional conditions on the factory floor\u201d); Williams v. General Motors Corp., 187 F.3d 553, 562-66 (6th Cir.1999) (holding that fifteen separate allegations of persistent foul language and sexually explicit comments directed at the plaintiff, three of which involved an \u201celement of physical invasion,\u201d offensive comments towards women in general, denial of the plaintiffs overtime, viewed collectively, created issue of fact that the plaintiff was subject to a sexually hostile work environment); Abeita v. TransAmerica Mailings, 159 F.3d 246, 252 (6th Cir.1998) (holding that the plaintiffs allegations of sexually offensive 'statements that were commonplace and ongoing over a period of seven years, coupled with daily statements by the president of the company, with whom the plaintiff worked closely, about his sexual interest in female employees and models, created fact question of sexually hostile work environment); Ercegovich, 154 F.3d at 356 (holding that isolated comment by senior official \u201cevidencing managerial policy,\u201d when coupled with numerous discriminatory comments by individuals occupying high positions might \u201creflect a cumulative managerial attitude among the defendant-employer\u2019s managers that has influenced the decisionmaking process for a considerable time\u201d).\\nNor is there any proof, direct or indirect, that Defendants \u201ctolerated or condoned\u201d the racial harassment. See Jackson, 191 F.3d at 659. With one exception, it was undisputed that Riley, Ford, and Avise were not aware of the alleged incidents. Smith testified simply that he complained to a supervisor about a racial comment only once. Riley testified, without contradiction, that after Smith spoke to him, Riley warned the employee that he would be disciplined, possibly terminated for any further racial comments. Smith\u2019s vague assertion that there was a general attitude of discrimination at Ad-com is insufficient to establish pretext. See Wixson v. Dowagiac Nursing Home, 87 F.3d 164, 171 (6th Cir.1996) (holding that the plaintiffs failed to create issue of fact by alleging numerous instances of disparate treatment and hostile work environment in conclusory terms with no reference to names, times, occasions). Thus, absent proof that Defendants condoned severe or pervasive racial harassment, Smith failed to show discrimination based on a racially hostile work environment. Cf. Ercegovich, 154 F.3d at 356 (holding that numerous age-related statements by management reflected a corporate mindset or discriminatory atmosphere).\\n3.\\nOver Defendants\u2019 objections, Smith also introduced statistics relating to the percentage of minority supervisors at Adcom and at Leggett\u2019s other Kentucky facilities in Leitchfield, Simpsonville, and Winchester to show pretext under the second Manzer prong. Admission of this evidence was likewise erroneous, and not harmless. First, Smith\u2019s statistics were not admissible because he did not establish the number of qualified minorities available in each labor market. See Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 650, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989); Gibson v. Frank, 946 F.2d 1229, 1233 (6th Cir.1991) (holding that the plaintiff failed to show discrimination because he did not demonstrate the proportion of blacks qualified for the position); Simpson v. Midland-Ross Corp., 823 F.2d 937, 943 (6th Cir.1987) (employee statistics unaccompanied by evidence regarding qualified *762potential from the relevant \u201cemployee statistics unaccompanied by evidence regarding qualified potential applicants from the relevant labor market\u201d lack probative value). Furthermore, the statistics relating to the percentage of minority supervisors at Adcom and other Leggett &amp; Platt facilities were not relevant to the issue of whether Adcom terminated Smith because of his race. See Kier v. Commercial Union Ins. Cos., 808 F.2d 1254, 1258 (7th Cir.1987) (holding that statistical evidence relating t\u00f3 the employer\u2019s hiring practices is irrelevant in discriminatory discharge case); Box v. A&amp;P Tea Co., 772 F.2d 1372, 1379-80 (7th Cir.1985) (statistics showing that the employer favored men in promotions had little relevance to claim that the employer discriminated because of sex in discipline). Smith\u2019s statistics lacked probative value and could not support a jury verdict on the ultimate question of discrimination.\\n4..\\nSmith also contends that the jury could have inferred racial animus from Defendants\u2019 purported lack of fear to Smith\u2019s threat. We note that both Guy and Ford testified that they were afraid of Smith after he made the threat. In any event, the issue before us is not whether Defendants exercised good judgment in firing Smith, but merely whether they did so because of an illicit motive. See Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1085. Absent some evidence of racial discrimination, Smith failed to meet his burden.\\nSmith\u2019s suggestion that Adcom\u2019s failure to promote him to the position of production supervisor is also insufficient to carry his burden. First, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law as to Smith\u2019s failure to promote claim. Further, the jury could not reasonably conclude that Smith was fired based upon the fact that Smith was not promoted to the position of facilitator five years earlier. Finally, the allegedly false statement concerning the need for a high school diploma was not relevant because it was made nine years before Smith\u2019s termination.\\nC.\\nSmith also tried to establish pretext under the third Manzer prong by demonstrating that he was treated differently than similarly situated employees. This type of evidence \u201cconsists of evidence that'other employees, particularly employees not in the protected class, were not fired even though they engaged in substantially identical conduct to that which the employer contends motivated its discharge of the plaintiff.\u201d Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1084. To be similarly situated, \u201cthe individuals with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare his\/her treatment must have dealt with the same supervisor, have been subject to the same standards and have engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer\u2019s treatment of them for it.\u201d Ercegovich, 154 F.3d at 352 (quoting Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp., 964 F.2d 577, 583 (6th Cir.1992)). Exact correlation is not required, however. See id. Rather, \u201cthe plaintiff and the employee with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare himself or herself must be similar in \u2018all of the relevant aspects.\u2019 \u201d Ercegovich, 154 F.3d at 352 (quoting Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., 40 F.3d 796, 802 (6th Cir.1994)); see also Harrison v. Metro. Government, 80 F.3d 1107, 1115 (6th Cir.1996) (noting that \u201cprecise equivalence in culpability between employees\u201d is not required when comparing similarly situated, non-minority employees).\\nAs evidence of disparate treatment, Smith attempted to compare himself to coworkers Reed, Hopper, and Banta. The-comparisons are inapt however, because Smith was disciplined by a different deci-sionmaker and engaged in different conduct than Reed, Hopper and Banta. See Ercegovich, 154 F.3d at 352; Mitchell, 964 F.2d at 583. *763Reed, Banta and Hopper were not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d as a matter of law. Riley, who made the decision to fire Smith, did not determine their discipline. Ralph Lutz, who was plant manager for a time,disciplined Reed and . Hopper. Although Riley signed Hopper\u2019s disciplinary form, it was undisputed that Riley referred the matter to Lutz, and that Lutz determined the punishment. Lutz was not even employed at Adcom when Riley terminated Smith. Ford, not Riley, made the decision to give Banta a verbal warning.\\nSmith\u2019s conduct is also dissimilar to Reed\u2019s, Hopper\u2019s, and Banta\u2019s. Riley testified that he terminated Smith because of his threat to \u201cblow away some MFers\u201d if his incentive pay.was not increased. Riley testified that as plant manager, he was concerned about plant safety. This is clearly a \u201cmitigating circumstance\u201d that prevents any comparison with Reed\u2019s, Hopper\u2019s, and Banta\u2019s significantly less threatening conduct, as determined by Defendants. Reed brought a handgun to work to protect himself against threats from a former Adcom employee. Reed did not show the gun to any other Adcom employees; it was discovered by a cleaning person. Lutz gave the handgun to Reed\u2019s wife (who also worked at the plant) and told her to tell Reed not to bring it back again. Lutz testified that because no one was threatened at the plant, he decided to keep the matter \u201clow key\u201d and not report it to the corporate office. Hopper invited his supervisor, Bill Grimes, to meet him off property, presumably to fight. Lutz decided to give Hopper merely a verbal warning because he felt, \u201cunder the circumstances, he didn\u2019t do any damage.\u201d Although Banta stuck a pair of heated pliers on a eoworkers neck, Ford gave merely a verbal warning because the employees were \u201chorseplaying,\u201d and Ford felt that Banta \u201cdidn\u2019t intentionally mean to hurt someone.\u201d\\nIn short, neither Reed, Hopper or Banta threatened random, plant-wide violence. Furthermore, it is inappropriate for the judiciary to substitute its judgment for that of management. See Krenik v. County of Le Sueur, 47 F.3d 953, 960 (8th Cir.1995) (holding that court cannot sit .as a \u201csuper-personnel department\u201d); Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir.1991) (same); see also Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1085 (holding that \u201c\u2018just-cause\u2019 arguments must not be allowed to creep into an employment discrimination lawsuit\u201d). Smith failed to show that he was treated differently than similarly-situated, non-minority employees. The . district court erred in admitting this evidence.\\nIn sum, there was insufficient evidence to find that Defendants proffered reason for firing Smith was pretextual. Given the \u201ccomplete absence of proof\u2019 on the material issue of racial animus in this case, the district court should have granted Defendants\u2019 motion for judgment as a matter of law. Furthermore, because the remaining, properly admitted evidence is insufficient to shoulder Smith\u2019s burden of proof, we now direct an entry of judgment as a matter of law for Defendants. See Weisgram v. Marley Co., \u2014 U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 1011, 1021-22, 145 L.Ed.2d 958 (2000).\\nIII.\\nGiven this outcome, Defendants\u2019 remaining claims regarding attorney\u2019s fees and corporate interrelationship are moot.\\nIV.\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Smith is REVERSED, and judgment as a matter of law is entered for Defendants.\\n\\n. The district court granted judgment as a matter of law on Smith's pattern or practice discrimination claim. Smith does not challenge that ruling on appeal. Rather, on appeal he argues that the alleged racially hostile atmosphere is proper circumstantial evidence that the proffered reason did not actually motivate his discharge. We therefore evaluate this evidence under the second Manzer prong.\\n\\n\", 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 9493264}, {'author_str': 'Martin', 'per_curiam': False, 'type': '040dissent', 'page_count': None, 'download_url': None, 'author_id': None, 'opinion_text': '\\nBOYCE F. MARTIN, JR., Chief Judge,\\ndissenting.\\nWe have here the question of whether Smith provided sufficient evidence to supn port the jury\u2019s finding that a racially hostile work environment was present at the plant and that race was a substantially motivating factor in .Adcom\u2019s decision to *764terminate Smith. The majority holds that such evidence of racism, if examined under the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test established in Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993), was not sufficient to overcome Adcom\u2019s post-verdict motion for judgement as a matter of law. In addition, the majority concludes that Smith\u2019s statement that \u201che was going to kill a bunch of M \u2014 F\u2014ers\u201d constituted a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for firing him, and that Smith failed to establish that this reason was pretextual. I must respectfully dissent.\\nI.\\nIn Harris, the Supreme Court held that courts reviewing a hostile work environment claim should consider \u201call of the circumstances,\u201d including the \u201cfrequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s performance.\u201d According to the Court, \u201cthe conduct in question must be severe or pervasive enough to create an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and the victim must subjectively regard that environment as abusive.\u201d Id. at 21-22, 114 S.Ct. 367. Moreover, the plaintiff must also prove that his employer \u201ctolerated or condoned the situation\u201d or knew or should have known of the alleged conduct and did nothing to correct the situation. See Jackson v. Quanex Corp., 191 F.3d 647, 659 (6th Cir.1999). The Supreme Court in Harris acknowledged that determining whether a work environment is objectively hostile or abusive is not a \u201cmathematically precise test.\u201d Id.\\nIn this case, the majority finds that the circulation of a racially discriminatory and lewd cartoon by a supervisor around the plant, the use of the \u201cN\u201d word and other racially demeaning terms by fellow employees and supervisors in the presence of Smith on more than one occasion, and disparate treatment concerning disciplinary measures imposed on other white employees at the plant for comparable offenses were not \u201csevere or pervasive enough\u201d to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an objectively hostile work environment existed at the plant. In reaching this conclusion, the majority fails to recognize this Court\u2019s decision in Williams v. General Motors Corp., 187 F.3d 553 (6th Cir.1999). In Williams, we reversed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff alleged multiple acts creating a hostile work environment: foul language, sexual comments directed at plaintiff, at least one incident of physical contact, perceived inequities of treatment, and pranks or annoying conduct by co-workers. See id. at 559, 562. We held the district court erred in its dismissal of these incidents as \u201c \u2018infrequent, not severe, not threatening or humiliating, but merely offensive.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 563. We found the district court failed to consider the totality of the circumstances and thereby \u201crobbed the incidents of their cumulative effect.\u201d Id. at 561.\\nSimilar to our holding in Williams, the majority\u2019s opinion in this case robs the incidents of racism presented by Smith of their cumulative effect. All that Smith is required to show is that the conduct in question was severe or pervasive enough to create an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and that he subjectively regarded that environment as abusive. This is a subjective, not an objective, test. Smith had worked at the plant for nearly twenty years. Over the years, he was exposed to a number of racially motivated acts and remarks. Some of the misconduct was directed at him, and some was not.\" The majority concludes that because each instance of racism was spread out over a twenty year period, no reasonable employee could subjectively view the atmosphere at the plant as racially hostile or abusive. I disagree on the basis of this Court\u2019s reasoning in Ercegovich v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber *765Co., 154 F.3d 344, 354-55 (6th Cir.1998), whereby we said that evidence of a corporate state of mind or discriminatory atmosphere is not rendered irrelevant by its failure to coincide precisely with the particular \u201ctime-frame involved in the specific events that generated a claim of discriminatory treatment.\u201d Discriminatory statements may reflect a cumulative managerial attitude among the defendant-employers\u2019 supervisors that has influenced the decision-making process for a considerable period of time. See id.\\nIn addition, the majority seems to be establishing that unless racially motivated misconduct is aimed at the plaintiff directly, simply seeing or overhearing it targeted at another is not sufficient to label the misconduct as \u201csevere.\u201d We have held that evidence of racist remarks or isolated incidences of racial conduct directed towards other African-American employees at the plant may be critical for -the jury\u2019s assessment of whether a given employer was more likely than not to have acted from an unlawful motive. See Robinson v. Runyon, 149 F.3d 507, 513 (6th Cir.1998). An employer may create a hostile environment for an employee even where it directs its discriminatory acts or practices at the protected group of which the plaintiff is a member, and not just at the plaintiff himself. See Jackson v. Quanex Corp., 191 F.3d 647 (6th Cir.1999). Thus, the fact that Smith was not the targeted victim of a racial remark made by a supervisor does not mean that such a remark was not offensive or humiliating to Smith. The jury was entitled to factor such remarks into their decision.\\nI believe that the Supreme Court did not intend for us to interpret the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test so narrowly by disaggregating the effect of each incident over time until its significance is lost or diluted. Instead, we should look more at the cumulative effect of these incidents over time in order to assess whether the atmosphere at the plant was racially hostile from plaintiffs subjective point of view. The district court found, that evidence of racial slurs and the offensive cartoon coupled with a lack of an effective disciplinary response to each incident over the years constituted a sufficient basis on which a reasonable jury could find that Smith was subjected to a racially hostile work environment. This finding was not unreasonable given the standard of review in this case, which states that a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law should not be granted unless there is a \u201ccomplete absence of proof on a material issue in the action.\u201d See Morales v. American Honda Motor Co., 151 F.3d 500, 506 (6th Cir.1998). By reversing the lower court\u2019s decision and granting Adcom its post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law, this Court fails to draw \u201call reasonable favorable inferences in favor of the nonmovant.\u201d See id. Accordingly, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to grant judgment to the defendant in this case on the basis that Smith did not provide sufficient evidence under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d I think the test is for a. jury to find that his termination was racially motivated. I would at least give him a new trial.\\nII.\\nThe majority also holds that Smith\u2019s remark in the presence of Bobby Guy that he \u201cwas going to kill a bunch of M \u2014 F\u2014 ers\u201d, which he does not deny making, constituted a threat against the company and a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for firing him. The majority concludes that because Smith failed to prove that his threat did not actually motivate his discharge or was pretext, he was not entitled to a decision in his favor on Adcom\u2019s post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law.\\nPretext is established by evidence showing that the legitimate reason claimed by the defendant for a particular action is not the true reason, but instead is a pretext for discrimination. See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. *7662742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). The plaintiff may demonstrate pretext by showing that (1) the defendant\u2019s proffered reason had no basis in fact, (2) the proffered reason did not actually motivate the termination, or (3) the proffered reason was not sufficient to motivate the discharge. See Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chem., 29 F.3d 1078, 1084 (6th Cir.1994).\\nIn this case, Smith does not dispute that he made the threatening remark under the first prong of the Manzer test or the fact that such a remark, under certain circumstances, would be a sufficient nondiscriminatory reason for firing someone under the third Manzer prong. However, under the third prong, there is a real dispute as to whether Smith\u2019s threat was directed toward any employee of the company or whether anyone at the plant took Smith\u2019s threat seriously. Moreover, there is no explanation as to why there was no direct law enforcement the day after the threat was made or why the employer waited until Monday to fire Smith. These are disputed issues, which in my opinion, are questions of fact for a jury, not the court, to decide.\\nUnder the second prong of the Manzer test, Smith seeks to show that \u201cthe sheer weight of the circumstantial evidence of discrimination makes it more likely than not that the employer\u2019s explanation is pretext.\u201d Id at 1084. Smith produces evidence of racism and unequal treatment over a twenty year period to show that a racially hostile work environment existed at the plant. The district court allowed such evidence to go to a jury so that the jury could decide whether Smith was fired because of the threat or discriminatory reasons. The majority incorrectly dismisses this evidence on the grounds that none of the racial comments were made by the persons who terminated Smith and most of the comments were made long before Smith\u2019s termination. Again, it is important to reiterate this Court\u2019s language in Ercegovich that evidence of a corporate state of mind or discriminatory atmosphere is not rendered irrelevant by its failure to coincide precisely with the particular actors or time-frame involved in the specific events that generated a claim of discriminatory treatment. Ercegovich, at 354-55. Thus, although discriminatory statements by a non-decision maker, standing alone, generally do not support an inference of discrimination, such statements are not categorically excluded. See id.\\nFinally, the majority writes that the evidence of racism Smith produced in this case should not have reached a jury because such evidence added an \u201cemotional element\u201d as a basis for the verdict. Being that this is a race discrimination case brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and given that the crux of Smith\u2019s case depends upon the production of evidence showing that he was fired for racial reasons, it is inconceivable to me that the majority would argue that evidence of racism at the plant should have been excluded for its alleged \u201cemotional\u201d impact on the jury. The district court allowed such evidence to go to the jury because it was both critical and relevant to Smith\u2019s claims. Thus, in my view, the district court did not commit reversible error in admitting the evidence.\\nIII.\\nIn sum, I believe that the district court did not err when it allowed evidence of racial remarks and conduct by supervisors and employees toward Smith and other African-American employees at Adcom to go to the jury. Under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach set forth in Harris, the frequency and severity of the discriminatory behavior among supervisors and employees were indicative of the racially hostile work environment at Adcom over an extended period of time. On one occasion, Smith was shown a lewd and racist cartoon by his supervisor that depicted African-Americans in a humiliating light. On other occasions, Smith was called a \u201cnigger\u201d by a fellow white employ*767ee \u2014 an employee who merely received a verbal reprimand for the remark by Smith\u2019s supervisor \u2014 and was present while a racially offensive joke was being told by a supervisor. According to Smith and other fellow employees, the use of the \u201cN\u201d word was commonplace at the plant and Smith was often present when the term was used. Such remarks constitute more than \u201cmere offensive utterances\u201d and are indicative of the racially hostile atmosphere at Adcom. Moreover, Smith, in my opinion, satisfied his evidentiary burden for a reasonable jury to find that the employer\u2019s explanation for firing him was pretext under the second and third prongs of the Manzer test.\\nAccordingly, I respectfully dissent.\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 9493265}]"},{"id":784416,"date_filed":"2003-12-15","judges":"Arnold, Beam, Bye, Morris, Sheppard","case_name_full":"Norma J.

We affirm.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      * This litigation stems from a \"notice of termination\" Curby submitted to Solutia under the mistaken belief she had a right to severance benefits pursuant to a golden parachute agreement she signed in February 1998 (the 1998 agreement). Curby submitted the notice a short time after Solutia reached an agreement with FMC Corporation to combine the companies\\' phosphorous and derivatives (P &amp; D) divisions. Because the joint venture would result in the elimination of Curby\\'s position as Vice President\/General Manager (VP\/GM) of Solutia\\'s P &amp; D division, Curby accepted the position of Vice President (VP) of Joint Ventures and Operating Agreements. Although the new position came with a $15,000 raise, Curby felt she had less responsibility and viewed the transfer from VP\/GM to VP as a demotion.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      In the notice, Curby claimed \"good reason\" for terminating her employment under the 1998 agreement. Section 5(c) of the 1998 agreement provided, in pertinent part, \"good reason\" would include Solutia\\'s assigning her \"duties inconsistent in any respect with [her] position (including status, office, titles and reporting requirement), authority, duties or responsibilities... or any other action by the Company which results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities[.]\" App. at 108. Curby sent the notice to Solutia\\'s general counsel, accompanied by a letter from an attorney who would be \"assisting Ms. Curby in the severance process with Solutia.\" Id. at 138. Although the attorney\\'s letter did not expressly claim Curby had a right to severance benefits, the tenor of the letter clearly indicated both Curby and her attorney believed she would be entitled to benefits under the golden parachute agreement.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Within hours of receiving the notice, Solutia\\'s general counsel responded with a letter indicating only a \"change of control\" of the company triggered benefits under the 1998 agreement. The letter further indicated there had been no change of control, so the 1998 agreement was not implicated and Curby had no right to severance benefits. In addition, the letter acknowledged and accepted Curby\\'s \"notice of termination\" as a letter of resignation pursuant to the standard employment agreement she had signed in September 1997.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      After Solutia deemed her notice a resignation, Curby claimed she had not resigned. She claimed she only intended her notice to trigger a claim for benefits under an employee benefit plan governed by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and entitled it a \"notice of termination\" only because the 1998 agreement required that terminology. Curby contended Solutia, by deeming the notice a resignation, had retaliated against her for making a claim for ERISA benefits. Two weeks after submitting the notice, she submitted a \"supplemental notice of termination\" adding as \"good reason\" for ending her employment the \"purported termination by the Company of [her] employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by the Agreement.\" Id. at 123.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      On May 30, 2000, Curby filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The same day, she started this lawsuit in Missouri state court, which Solutia removed to federal court. Curby\\'s suit ultimately included several claims of race and sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e to 2000e-17, her claim Solutia discharged her in retaliation for making a claim for ERISA benefits, and a claim Solutia interfered with her right to ERISA benefits.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      The district court granted Solutia summary judgment on all of Curby\\'s claims. The district court rejected the ERISA claims after concluding the 1998 employment agreement was not at issue because there had been no \"change of control.\" The district court also rejected the race and sex discrimination claims on various grounds. Curby filed a timely appeal.\\n    \\n    II\\n    \\n      8\\n      Curby contends Solutia violated ERISA by discharging and\/or discriminating against her for making a claim for benefits under her 1998 employment agreement, and Solutia interfered with her right to ERISA benefits. We review Curby\\'s ERISA-related claims de novo. Kinkead v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 49 F.3d 454, 456 (8th Cir.1995).\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      Section 510 of ERISA provides \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which [s]he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1140. We analyze claims brought pursuant to section 510 of ERISA under the three-stage burden-shifting paradigm articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Jefferson v. Vickers, Inc., 102 F.3d 960, 964 (8th Cir.1996). That is, a plaintiff \"must prove that [s]he participated in a statutorily protected activity...; that an adverse employment action was taken against h[er] ...; and that a causal connection existed between the two.\" Rath v. Selection Research, Inc., 978 F.2d 1087, 1090 (8th Cir.1992). We conclude Curby\\'s claim fails under all three stages of the McDonnell Douglas test.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      In order for Curby to show she engaged in protected activity (i.e., making a claim for ERISA benefits), her claim has to be reasonable. Cf. Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 271, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) (rejecting plaintiff\\'s Title VII claim alleging hostile work environment based upon a single, sexually suggestive remark, because no reasonable person could believe a single remark created a hostile work environment).\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Section 6(a) of the 1998 agreement indicates severance benefits are payable only if employment is terminated \"during the Employment Period.\" App. at 110. The Employment Period in turn is defined as a three-year period following the Effective Date, id. at 103, and the Effective Date is defined as \"the first date during the Change of Control Period ... on which a Change of Control ... occurs.\" Id. at 101. Thus, the agreement requires a \"Change of Control\" to trigger an \"Effective Date\" which begins the three-year \"Employment Period\" during which severance benefits are payable if an employee is terminated.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Section 2 of the agreement lists four situations deemed to be changes of control, namely, 1) the acquisition by another entity of more than 20% of the company\\'s stock or voting power, 2) certain changes in the makeup of the \"Incumbent Board,\" 3) consummation by the company as a result of a sale or other disposition of substantially all the company\\'s assets or the acquisition of the assets or stock of another corporation (i.e., a \"Business Combination\"), or 4) the complete liquidation or dissolution of the company. Id. at 102-03.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      It is undisputed no change of control occurred here; thus there was no effective date or employment period to trigger a right to severance benefits. Therefore, Curby had no right to severance benefits under the 1998 agreement. Section 12(f) of the agreement unequivocally states \"the Executive\\'s employment ... may be terminated by either the Executive or the Company at any time prior to the Effective Date, in which case Executive shall have no further rights under this Agreement.\" Id. at 119. Thus, when Curby chose to terminate her employment by providing Solutia with a notice of termination absent a change of control, she had no reasonable basis for believing she had a right to severance benefits under the 1998 agreement.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Curby contends, however, the 1998 agreement only required the threat of a change of control to trigger the right to a severance package. She relies upon language in the agreement\\'s prefatory paragraph which referred to the \"possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control\" and a \"pending or threatened Change of Control,\" id. at 101, and contends Solutia\\'s chief operating officer told her some investment bankers were considering a leveraged buyout of Solutia. She argues the agreement\\'s prefatory paragraph renders its definition of change of control ambiguous, and it was therefore reasonable for her to believe the mere threat of a change of control triggered the right to benefits. We disagree.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      The mention of the possibility of a change of control in the prefatory paragraph only served to explain why Solutia\\'s Board of Directors wished to enter into golden parachute agreements with certain key executives. That language in no way rendered ambiguous the language controlling what events would actually trigger an employee\\'s right to a severance package. The agreement is clear and definite in that regard. Thus, Curby has not shown her claim for benefits was reasonable.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Because she resigned, Curby also cannot show she suffered an adverse employment action. An employee cannot submit a resignation and then claim the employer\\'s acceptance of the resignation is an adverse employment action. Hammon v. DHL Airways, Inc., 165 F.3d 441, 447 (6th Cir.1999); cf. Briggs v. Anderson, 796 F.2d 1009, 1021 (8th Cir.1986) (holding employees who had voluntarily resigned were not entitled to make employment discrimination claims under Title VII). We reject Curby\\'s attempts to differentiate between a \"notice of termination\" and a letter of resignation. Curby obviously could not make a claim for severance benefits while at the same time continuing her employment with Solutia. Thus, whether entitled a \"letter of resignation\" or a \"notice of termination,\" the notice Curby submitted clearly conveyed her intent to end her employment relationship with Solutia, i.e., resign.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      It follows that Curby\\'s claim also fails under the third stage of the McDonnell Douglas test. Since Curby neither engaged in a protected activity, nor suffered an adverse employment action, there can be no causal connection between the two. Thus, Curby\\'s claim that Solutia discharged her and\/or discriminated against her for making a claim for ERISA benefits necessarily fails. Furthermore, since she had no right to benefits under the 1998 agreement, her claim that Solutia interfered with her right to ERISA benefits fails as well.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Curby contends, even if we reject her ERISA claims, she is entitled to attorney fees because the 1998 agreement provided Solutia would pay her legal fees \"regardless of the outcome\" of any dispute between the two over the agreement. We disagree. Although the agreement promised fees regardless of the outcome of this dispute, it also limited recovery to those fees \"reasonably\" incurred. See App. at 114 (providing Solutia would pay \"all legal fees and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company, the Executive or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Agreement....\") (emphasis added). We conclude the reference to fees \"reasonably incur[red]\" requires both that the time spent on the claims be reasonable and that the claimant\\'s litigation position be reasonable. See Gerow v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co., 308 F.3d 721, 726 (7th Cir.2002) (interpreting similar language in a golden parachute agreement). \"Otherwise the employer has written a blank check that every employee would seek to cash on the off chance that a court would order the employer to pay more.\" Id. Since Curby\\'s litigation position is unreasonable, she is not entitled to fees under the agreement.\\n    \\n    III\\n    \\n      19\\n      Curby also makes several claims of race and sex discrimination under Title VII. We review these claims de novo. Jones v. Frank, 973 F.2d 673, 675 (8th Cir.1992).\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      First, Curby contends Solutia discriminated against her on the basis of her sex and race (Curby is black) by failing to name her as the chief executive officer of Astaris (the name of the joint venture combining Solutia\\'s and FMC\\'s P &amp; D divisions) and selecting a white male instead. The district court properly dismissed this claim because the statute of limitations had run. Curby learned she would not get the position on May 20, 1999, but did not file her charge of discrimination until over a year later on May 30, 2000. See Klein v. McGowan, 198 F.3d 705, 709 (8th Cir.1999) (\"Before bringing a Title VII action, a plaintiff must file a charge with the EEOC within 300 days of the event giving rise to the cause of action. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e).\"). Curby argues the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the Federal Trade Commission approved the joint venture, but we disagree. See Delaware State Coll. v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 259, 260-61, 101 S. Ct. 498, 66 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1980) (holding Title VII limitations period commences at the time decision is made and communicated to the plaintiff, even where the effects of the decision do not occur until some future date or are subject to change).\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      Next, Curby contends Solutia discriminated against her by transferring her from the position of VP\/GM of the P &amp; D Division, to the position of VP of Joint Ventures and Operating Agreements. This claim is also subject to the McDonnell Douglas framework (as are the remainder of Curby\\'s claims) and was properly dismissed for two reasons. First, the change in position did not constitute an adverse employment action because there was no reduction in pay or benefits. See Ledergerber v. Stangler, 122 F.3d 1142, 1144 (8th Cir.1997) (recognizing loss of status and prestige alone are insufficient to establish an adverse employment action). Second, Solutia offered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the transfer&#8212;Curby\\'s prior position was being eliminated by the joint venture and she desired to remain with Solutia&#8212;and Curby presented no evidence that Solutia\\'s articulated reason was a pretext for discrimination. See Texas Dep\\'t of Cmty. Affairs, 450 U.S. 248, 254-55, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981) (explaining plaintiff\\'s burden of showing pretext once employer articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions).\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      Curby next contends Solutia discriminated against her by not giving her a \"1999 Severance Package\" offered to other employees. This claim fails because Curby accepted the position of VP of Joint Ventures and Operating Agreements in lieu of the severance package, and therefore suffered no adverse employment action. See Jones v. Reliant Energy-ARKLA, 336 F.3d 689, 692 (8th Cir.2003) (holding that employee who was given a job instead of a severance package suffered no adverse employment action); see also Cooney v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 258 F.3d 731, 733-34 (8th Cir.2001) (holding that employees who are denied severance but retain their jobs have not suffered an adverse employment action).\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Curby also claims Solutia discriminated against her by not making her VP\/GM of Nylon Plastics &amp; Polymers (NPP) and selecting a white male for that position. This claim fails because Solutia articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision. Solutia said it did not consider Curby for the NPP position because she had just accepted her new position as VP of Joint Ventures and Operating Agreements. Solutia also presented several reasons why it considered the person chosen for the NPP position more qualified than Curby. Curby claims she was more qualified, but her subjective opinions regarding her own qualifications are not evidence of pretext. See Rose-Maston v. NME Hosps., Inc., 133 F.3d 1104, 1109 (8th Cir.1998).\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      The remainder of Curby\\'s race and sex discrimination claims merit no discussion, and we affirm the dismissal of those claims for the reasons stated by the district court. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.\\n    \\n    IV\\n    \\n      25\\n      We affirm the district court\\'s judgment in all respects.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        Notes:\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         The Honorable Charles A.

See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq. Cheshewalla asserts sexual harassment and retaliation claims, while the latter two plaintiffs assert only retaliation claims. We affirm.\\n    \\n    I.\\n    \\n      2\\n      Rand &amp; Son Construction Company (Rand) provides construction services for various client companies, including Allied Honeywell (Honeywell), a defense contractor. Rand employees working at Honeywell were required to have a badge for security purposes. A red badge indicated that the individual was \"uncleared,\" or lacked security clearance, and therefore had to be accompanied by a security guard. A yellow or blue badge indicated that the individual was cleared. The process of obtaining such clearance was complicated and could take up to eighteen months. In the event of a reduction in force, Honeywell preferred that Rand retain employees with blue or yellow badges over those with red badges. The plaintiffs, Rand employees, were assigned to Honeywell\\'s maintenance project. Most Rand employees working at Honeywell were either carpenters or laborers. Michaels and Petkoff were hired in 2000, the former as a carpenter apprentice and the latter as a carpenter. Cheshewalla was hired as a laborer in the same year. All three plaintiffs were uncleared, having only red badges.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Since approximately 1995, Michael Gibbins served as foreman for the laborers at Honeywell, while Danny Franks served as the foreman for the carpenters. In these capacities, Franks indicated to Gibbins the work to be performed by the laborers. Dave Burke, the lead foreman stationed at the site, was above Franks and Gibbins in the chain of command. Ernest Patires, Rand\\'s Vice President, served as the project manager for the Honeywell site, but was not stationed there.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      On November 3, 2000, two female Honeywell employees reported to Linda Christian, Rand\\'s EEO Officer, that one of Rand\\'s employees was exposing himself to women. Christian\\'s investigations led her to believe that Cheshewalla was being subjected to this behavior, and she contacted Cheshewalla and the three other female laborers working at Honeywell to obtain more information. Cheshewalla denied that anything had happened to her, but expressed her fear that she ran the risk of being fired by talking to Christian. Christian told Cheshewalla that she would not be fired for speaking to her. Christian did not learn who was exposing himself, and none of the women stated that they had been subjected to this display. Christian closed the file on this issue on November 16, 2000. Approximately three days later, a man, now known to be Petkoff, anonymously telephoned Christian and stated that Gibbins was harassing women. Petkoff did not specify which women or what Gibbins was doing to harass them. Gibbins was transferred to another job site the day of the telephone call. Petkoff and Michaels later complained about Gibbins\\'s conduct to Burke, Franks, Christian, and Patires.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      On approximately January 8, 2001, Gibbins was reassigned to the Honeywell site. On January 11, Christian heard rumors that Gibbins had been asking Cheshewalla for a date and that they were driving to work together. Hours later, Gibbins reported to Christian that he had heard rumors that he had sexually harassed Cheshewalla. The next day, Petkoff confronted Gibbins about Gibbins\\'s treatment of Cheshewalla, and the labor union registered a sexual harassment complaint by Cheshewalla against Gibbins. The labor union\\'s business agent, Les Williams, attempted to meet with the people involved, but Cheshewalla failed to attend. Gibbins was once again transferred from the Honeywell site, never to return. On January 16, Cheshewalla met with Christian and Patires, and told them that Gibbins had been harassing her.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      It is undisputed that the need for layoffs in the maintenance project arose in January of 2001. Rand\\'s business is cyclical. The workload is lowest at the beginning of each year when the funding for government contracts has yet to be received. Therefore, layoffs commonly arose each year at this time. Michaels and Petkoff were laid off on January 29. Cheshewalla missed work on the last two days of January and on seven days in early to mid February. On February 16, the last of these nine days of absence, Patires informed Cheshewalla by telephone that she had been laid off.\\n    \\n    II.\\n    \\n      7\\n      We review de novo the district court\\'s grant of summary judgment. Shanklin v. Fitzgerald, 397 F.3d 596, 602 (8th Cir.2005). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and conclude that summary judgment was proper only where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id.; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Cheshewalla claims that she was subjected to a hostile work environment on the basis of sexual harassment by Gibbins. To establish a hostile work environment claim, Cheshewalla \"must show that she was subjected to unwelcome sex-based harassment that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter a term, condition, or privilege of her employment.\" Joens v. John Morrell &amp; Co., 354 F.3d 938, 940 (8th Cir.2004). Assuming, arguendo, that the alleged harassment was sufficiently severe to state a claim of hostile work environment, we turn to the question whether Gibbins is properly considered a co-worker or a supervisor. If the former, Cheshewalla must also show that Rand \"`knew or should have known of the conduct and failed to take proper remedial action.\\'\" Id. (quoting Dhyne v. Meiners Thriftway, Inc., 184 F.3d 983, 987 (8th Cir.1999)). If the latter, Rand \"is vicariously liable for the harassment unless it can establish the affirmative defense defined in Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth.\" Joens, 354 F.3d at 940; Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 807-08, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (noting that the affirmative defense is available only when no tangible employment action is taken). Because we conclude that Gibbins was not a supervisor, we do not discuss the affirmative defense.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      In Joens, we held that to be considered a supervisor, \"the alleged harasser must have had the power (not necessarily exercised) to take tangible employment action against the victim, such as the authority to hire, fire, promote, or reassign to significantly different duties.\" Joens, 354 F.3d at 940. See also Weyers v. Lear Operations Corp., 359 F.3d 1049, 1057 (8th Cir.2004). Gibbins, as foreman, could not hire, fire, or promote the laborers, nor could he assign them to a different job site. Patires possessed this authority and although he may have consulted with Gibbins on such matters, the record is clear that Gibbins lacked any such authority. Cf. Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 747, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998) (where the alleged harasser was \"a midlevel manager[,] ... was a vice president in one of five business units[, and] ... had authority to make hiring and promotion decisions subject to the approval of his supervisor\"); Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275 (discussing vicarious liability of the employer for harassment by a supervisor \"with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee\"). The fact that Patires was not present at the Honeywell site is irrelevant under the definition of supervisor established in Joens. Finally, Cheshewalla\\'s belief that Gibbins possessed the authority of a supervisor does not alter our conclusion in this case. See Weyers, 359 F.3d at 1057 n. 7 (noting that the alleged harasser\\'s \"apparent authority would be an insufficient basis to support a finding of supervisor status\").\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      Because Gibbins is considered a co-worker under the test set forth in Joens, Cheshewalla\\'s claim is without merit unless she can demonstrate that Rand knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take proper remedial action. See Dhyne, 184 F.3d at 987. The record demonstrates that Rand attempted to determine at the outset what, if any, harassment was ongoing by requiring Christian to investigate and then took remedial action by reassigning Gibbins to another job site solely on the basis of an anonymous telephone call. Christian contacted the female laborers at the Honeywell site and told them they could call her at work or at home. Christian encouraged Cheshewalla to speak with her, telling Cheshewalla that she would not be fired for speaking to her. In January 2001, Christian learned, after considerable effort, that Gibbins was reportedly harassing Cheshewalla and it was then that Christian and Williams received this information from Cheshewalla. Gibbins was permanently transferred from the Honeywell site on the basis of the reports, before Cheshewalla had confirmed the reports directly. Moreover, Cheshewalla did not report any harassment occurring after January 11, when Christian was first alerted that it was in fact Cheshewalla who was being harassed. Cheshewalla has not made any of the showings required in order for her to prevail on this issue.\\n    \\n    III.\\n    \\n      11\\n      Cheshewalla further claims that Rand retaliated against her for reporting that Gibbins sexually harassed her. To make out a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, Cheshewalla must show that: (1) she engaged in statutorily protected conduct; (2) there was an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal connection exists between this conduct and the adverse action. Sallis v. University of Minn., 408 F.3d 470, 477 (8th Cir.2005). The first two elements are established by Cheshewalla\\'s complaint to Christian and others, and her layoff. A material issue of fact has not been raised, however, with regard to a causal connection between Cheshewalla\\'s complaints and her layoff.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Cheshewalla has supplied no evidence of retaliation other than the fact that she was laid off exactly one month after reporting that Gibbins had sexually harassed her. The four-week interval between Cheshewalla\\'s complaint and her layoff is insufficient to establish a showing of causal connection, given the other facts of this case. We have held that \"[g]enerally, more than a temporal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action is required to present a genuine factual issue on retaliation,\" Kiel v. Select Artificials, Inc., 169 F.3d 1131, 1136 (8th Cir.1999) (en banc), although in some cases we have held close temporal proximity to be sufficient as a matter of law to demonstrate causal connection. See, e.g., Couty v. Dole, 886 F.2d 147, 148 (8th Cir.1989). Two events that occurred between the protected conduct and the layoff bring this case within the reach of Kiel. Cheshewalla missed many days of work and was in fact laid off on a day when she was skipping work, and Rand was undergoing a period of layoffs and reduced work availability. We conclude here, as we did in Kiel, that the intervening events \"eroded any causal connection\" suggested by the temporal proximity of Cheshewalla\\'s protected conduct and her layoff. 169 F.3d at 1136. With regard to the reduction in the workforce that had been ongoing in the weeks before Cheshewalla was laid off, company policy dictated that uncleared laborers, such as Cheshewalla, should be the first types of employees to be laid off. Moreover, Rand evinced a willingness to transfer Gibbins to another job site, the first time on an anonymous tip, and the second time on more reliable information. Without any evidence of retaliation, it simply does not follow that Rand would take all appropriate actions (e.g., transferring Gibbins), wait a month, and then decide to lay off Cheshewalla in retaliation for her complaint. Under these circumstances, temporal proximity alone does not allow Cheshewalla to prevail, because no reasonable jury could conclude from this scant evidence that Rand had retaliated against her.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Whether we cabin our examination of these intervening events under the third element of the prima facie case or under the subsequent step of the defendant\\'s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, see Peterson v. Scott County, 406 F.3d 515, 524 (8th Cir.2005), the result is the same.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      The fact that Cheshewalla was not later rehired when Rand had work to offer does not raise an issue of material fact. No explanation need be given for the failure to rehire an employee who was laid off on the day of her ninth absence from work within a short period of time. Regardless of whether Cheshewalla\\'s departure was labeled a layoff or a termination, no causal connection between the protected activity and adverse employment action has been shown.\\n    \\n    IV.\\n    \\n      15\\n      Michaels and Petkoff allege that Rand retaliated against them for reporting that Gibbins was sexually harassing Cheshewalla. Neither the plaintiffs\\' brief nor the district court\\'s opinion addresses the element of causal connection required to make out a prima facie case of retaliation. Based upon our review of the record, we find their claims too attenuated to withstand summary judgment, for there is a notable absence of any evidence tying their reports of sexual harassment to their layoffs and subsequent predicament of not being rehired.2 As with Cheshewalla, there is a relatively close temporal proximity between their protected conduct and their layoffs. Yet again, this appears to be a mere coincidence, as the usual January reduction in force was ongoing and plaintiffs\\' red badge status dictated that they be disfavored in the process. Michaels\\'s and Petkoff\\'s disfavored status notwithstanding, three journeymen carpenters had already been laid off before January 29, 2001.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      The district court\\'s thorough analysis of why Rand\\'s rationales for laying off and not rehiring Michaels and Petkoff are not pretexts would make their claims unavailing had a prima facie case been made out. We conclude, however, that such an analysis is unnecessary, given that the plaintiffs have not carried their initial burden in this regard.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      The judgment is affirmed.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        Notes:\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         The Honorable Ortrie D.

She appeals all of the district court\\'s determinations except for its grant of summary judgment in favor of the University on the retaliation claim. For the reasons set forth in the following opinion, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      * BACKGROUND\\n    \\n    A. Facts\\n    \\n      3\\n      Deborah Cullen began her employment at Indiana University\\'s Indianapolis campus in May 1990. She was appointed Director of the Respiratory Therapy Program, with the rank of associate professor. She also was credited with three years toward tenure. Her salary was $45,000. Dr. Cullen\\'s male predecessor had been paid $36,742. The Respiratory Therapy Program operates as a department of the School of Allied Health Sciences (\"SOAHS\"), which has eighteen programs, including Physical Therapy.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Dr. Cullen holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Respiratory Therapy, a Master of Arts in Education and a Doctor of Education degree. She had fifteen years\\' teaching experience prior to arriving at the University, including serving as Director of Grossmont College\\'s two-year Respiratory Therapy Program from 1984-1990. In 1994, Dr. Cullen was granted tenure at Indiana University; she was promoted to full professor in April 1995. Dr. Cullen has chaired numerous committees, authored articles and secured grants for the Respiratory Therapy Program, including $150,000 of annual funding from Clarian Health Providers. In 1997, acting SOAHS Dean Mark Sothmann increased her salary from approximately $58,000 to $62,000, so that she would be paid more than a male associate professor whom she supervised. From 1991 through 1998, Dr. Cullen\\'s annual salary increases averaged 4.37%; the average of SOAHS faculty increases was 3.25% per year.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      In July 1998, Sandy Quillen, Ph.D. was hired by Dean Sothmann as Program Director for Physical Therapy and as a tenured associate professor at a salary of $90,000. His predecessor, a woman, had been paid $85,696. Dr. Quillen holds five degrees: a Bachelor of Science degree in Health and Physical Education, a Bachelor of Science degree in Physical Therapy, a Master of Education in Developmental and Adaptative Physical Education, a Master of Public Affairs in Health Services Management, and a Ph.D. in Sports Medicine. Before he was hired by the University, Dr. Quillen was Chair of the Department of Physical Therapy at the College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati, Ohio. In that post, he was paid a comparable salary in the \"high 80\\'s.\" R.68, Ex.2 at 125-26.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      At the time of Dr. Quillen\\'s hiring, Dean Sothmann conducted a national search, but received few applications for the Physical Therapy Program Director position. The Physical Therapy Program was on probationary accreditation status and in danger of losing its accreditation. This situation presented a major problem for the University because students must graduate from an accredited program in order to be permitted to sit for the physical therapy licensing exam. Upon assuming his responsibilities, therefore, Dr. Quillen was required to extricate the program from probation and to create a graduate program in order to maintain accreditation. Dr. Quillen has launched successfully a graduate program, which now offers the only doctoral program in the SOAHS.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      The Physical Therapy Program accounts for a significant amount of tuition in the SOAHS; for example, in 1998-99, it generated 29.3% of the SOAHS\\' tuition revenue. In fact, the SOAHS could not survive without a financially viable Physical Therapy Program. In 1998-99, Physical Therapy generated $567,771 to Respiratory Therapy\\'s $87,517. Physical Therapy also has twice as many students and faculty as Respiratory Therapy (e.g., in 1999, 116 students as opposed to 57 students and 6 faculty as opposed to 3 faculty). Between 1995 and 2000, Physical Therapy awarded two and a half times as many bachelor\\'s degrees as Respiratory Therapy.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      During 1998-99, Dr. Cullen was paid $63,240; Dr. Quillen was paid $90,000. In 1999-00, the comparison was $67,114 to $93,150; in 2000-01, $68,121 to $94,547; and in 2001-02, $70,505 to $97,856. This disparity is in accord with the average differential between directors in these positions at other Midwestern schools. That disparity was $18,000 in 1999, more than $20,000 in 2000, and approximately $30,000 in 2001. Both Dr. Cullen and Dr. Quillen are compensated within the range of salaries paid for their respective disciplines.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      In the early 1990s, a University professor of economics, Paul Carlin, conducted a pay equity study. The study found a statistically significant gap between the salaries of male and female faculty members, and Carlin could not rule out discrimination as a cause. In 1997-98, Patrick Rooney, Special Assistant to the Chancellor, and Paul Carlin conducted a second study, which was controlled for a number of factors. The results found a \"statistically-significant\" gap between the salaries of male and female faculty members. R.71, Ex.D at 25. Dr. Cullen was identified as an \"outlier,\" which the study defined as more than one standard deviation below her predicted salary for 1996-97. Her predicted salary was $71,313.60. One standard deviation below this figure is $61,774.29. Dr. Cullen actually earned $58,128. Paul Carlin testified that he could not rule out gender discrimination as the cause of Dr. Cullen\\'s lower salary. It is notable that approximately 60% of the outliers identified by the study were male.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      The University submits that, although the study is a helpful tool, it fails to account accurately for the market at the time of hire and for an individual\\'s productivity. The study was not designed to ascertain the appropriate salaries of professors, but was to be used as a first step in the compensation analysis. It contemplated that committees in each department would undertake a further assessment that took into account individual factors. The University also notes that, for purposes of academic research, a figure of less than two standard deviations is not considered statistically significant; however, it identified individuals of greater than one standard deviation as outliers in order to ensure a thorough analysis. Dr. Cullen\\'s salary fell between one and two standard deviations.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      The SOAHS ad hoc review committee \"strongly recommend[ed]\" that Dr. Cullen\\'s pay be increased to rectify salary inequity, but concluded that her history of small incremental salary increases was not significantly less than the averages for SOAHS and Respiratory Therapy faculty. R.71, Ex.11. Dean Sothmann informed Dr. Cullen that he would recommend a raise to her \"predicted salary of $64,901.\" R.71, Ex.10. This \"predicted salary\" is one standard deviation below the mean figure. Dean Sothmann also informed the Chancellor\\'s office that Dr. Cullen\\'s salary ought to be adjusted to the predicted level. Dr. Cullen\\'s salary was then adjusted from $63,240 to $64,901.\\n    \\n    B. District Court Proceedings\\n    \\n      12\\n      Before the district court, Dr. Cullen alleged that the University discriminated against her in violation of the Equal Pay Act and on the basis of her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Dr. Cullen claimed that the University employed a similarly situated male, Dr. Quillen, to perform the same job as her own and paid him a higher salary. Moreover, she argued that the University\\'s actions constituted indirect evidence of an intent to pay her less than male employees because of her gender. The University moved for summary judgment on both claims. The district court granted summary judgment for the University on the Equal Pay Act claim because it determined that Dr. Cullen failed to establish a prima facie case. See R.86 at 20. The court concluded that Dr. Quillen had \"substantially more additional responsibilities than Dr. Cullen which justifi[ed] his higher salary.\" Id. Alternatively, the court concluded that, assuming a prima facie case, Dr. Cullen\\'s evidence did not present a material dispute to contradict the University\\'s affirmative defense that the pay differential was based on factors other than sex. See id. at 23. The court noted the significance of disparate educational backgrounds and job responsibilities as reasons for its conclusion that the University had carried its burden of persuasion on the affirmative defense. See id. at 21-22. The court also concluded that the University\\'s Pay Equity Study was not prima facie evidence of wage-based discrimination because it was not designed to prove or calculate discrimination alone but to identify cases that merited further inquiry. See id. at 22-23.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      With respect to the Title VII claim, the court concluded that Dr. Cullen failed to establish a prima facie case because she did not identify an adverse employment action (her salary was increased) or present evidence of a similarly situated male that was treated more favorably. See id. at 24-25. The court also found it significant that there was no evidence of intent to discriminate. See id. at 25.\\n    \\n    II\\n    DISCUSSION\\n    A. Equal Pay Act\\n    \\n      14\\n      Dr. Cullen submits that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the University on her Equal Pay Act (\"EPA\") claim; we review a district court\\'s grant of summary judgment de novo. See Boyce v. Moore, 314 F.3d 884, 888 (7th Cir.2002).\\n    \\n    1. Prima Facie Case\\n    \\n      15\\n      To establish a prima facie case of wage discrimination under the EPA, Dr. Cullen must show: \"(1) higher wages were paid to a male employee, (2) for equal work requiring substantially similar skill, effort and responsibilities, and (3) the work was performed under similar working conditions.\" Stopka v. Alliance of Am. Insurers, 141 F.3d 681, 685 (7th Cir.1998). In determining whether two jobs are equal, the crucial inquiry is \"whether the jobs to be compared have a `common core\\' of tasks, i.e., whether a significant portion of the two jobs is identical.\" Fallon v. Illinois, 882 F.2d 1206, 1209 (7th Cir.1989) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Once the plaintiff establishes a common core, the court must ask whether any additional tasks make the jobs \"substantially different.\" Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted). Significantly, the EPA does not require proof of discriminatory intent. See Stopka, 141 F.3d at 685.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      It is undisputed that in this case the first element is established. In 1998-99, Dr. Cullen was paid $63,240 and Dr. Quillen, a male, was paid $90,000. See R.71, Ex.27. The disparity continued through the 2001-02 academic year when Dr. Cullen earned $70,505 and Dr. Quillen earned $97,856. See R.71, Ex.43. Nevertheless, Dr. Cullen must establish that the jobs were equal. Although the \"common core\" of the positions held by Dr. Cullen and Dr. Quillen suggests equality, Dr. Quillen\\'s job entailed significant additional responsibilities, making it substantially different. The EPA specifies three separate elements that are to be considered in comparing job duties: skill, effort and responsibility. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 206(d)(1). Each of these elements must be met individually to establish a prima facie case. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1620.14.1 Moreover, the jobs must be performed under similar working conditions. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 206(d)(1); Stopka, 141 F.3d at 685.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      First, we consider whether the positions required the same level of skill. \"Skill includes consideration of such factors as experience, training, education, and ability.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1620.15(a). Although Dr. Cullen and Dr. Quillen have different educational credentials, the comparison at this juncture is between positions, not individuals. See id. (\"Possession of a skill not needed to meet the requirements of the job cannot be considered in making a determination regarding equality of skill.\"); 4 Joseph G. Cook &amp; John L. Sobieski, Jr., Civil Rights Actions &#182; 20.15[B], at 20-123-24 (2003) (noting that the issue is comparison of jobs, individual qualifications are irrelevant at this point in the analysis).2 Although different educational levels required by different positions can be significant, there is no suggestion that Physical Therapy Program Directors are required to hold more degrees than Respiratory Therapy Program Directors. However, the positions did require different levels of ability, for the Physical Therapy Program Director was required to create a new graduate program, which the Respiratory Therapy Program Director position did not require. See Horner v. Mary Inst., 613 F.2d 706, 714 (8th Cir.1980) (finding different skill requirements between positions of elementary school teachers when one teacher was required to develop and implement a physical education curriculum and the other was to teach courses selected by someone else). Accordingly, the positions do not require equal levels of skill.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      The second inquiry is whether the two positions require equal amounts of effort. Dr. Quillen was appointed when the Physical Therapy Program was on probation, and he was given the task of saving the program and creating a graduate course of study. See R.68, Ex.2 at 124-26. Dr. Cullen nevertheless submits that, although Physical Therapy has a strong tuition base, she had to exert more effort to secure outside funding to supplement her department\\'s resources, an effort, she claims, that Dr. Quillen does not match. See R.71, Ex.B at 49-53; R.71, Ex.42 at 8. Although this consideration may decrease somewhat the significance in the disparity between the effort required by the two positions, we think the district court correctly concluded that the effort required to create Master\\'s and Doctoral courses of study in a program on probation to be greater than that required to secure grants for the Respiratory Therapy Department. See R.75, Ex.24 at &#182;&#182; 12-13 (stating that Physical Therapy requires a graduate program to maintain accreditation, and failure to do so would preclude graduates from sitting for the licensure exam); R.68, Ex.2 at 124-26 &amp; 137; R.68, Ex.20 at &#182; 12 (indicating that SOAHS would not be able to operate without a viable Physical Therapy Program); 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1620.16(a) (\"Job factors which cause mental fatigue and stress ... are to be considered in determining the effort required by the job.\"). The jobs do not require equal effort; Dr. Cullen cannot establish her prima facie case of equal positions.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      Third, we must determine whether the two positions impose the same level of responsibility. The Respiratory Therapy Program at the University required Dr. Quillen to create and launch a graduate program. Dr. Cullen is not responsible for such a program. See R.68, Ex.2 at 124-26. Dr. Cullen argues that the creation of the graduate program was not an additional duty, for she was also required to meet accreditation requirements. However, this argument places too much emphasis on the job description or title of \"establishing program accreditation,\" see R.71, Ex.B at 45, instead of considering \"the duties actually performed by each employee.\" Dey v. Colt Constr. &amp; Dev. Co., 28 F.3d 1446, 1461 (7th Cir.1994).\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      Dr. Quillen supervises more students and faculty members. As of September 1999, Dr. Quillen was responsible for 116 students to Dr. Cullen\\'s 57, and Dr. Quillen supervised six faculty members and two secretaries to Dr. Cullen\\'s three faculty members and one secretary. See R.71, Ex.25 at 5. Dr. Cullen contends that the record contains no evidence that Dr. Quillen exercises any supervision over students or that the additional faculty members create a greater burden in terms of responsibility. Supervisory responsibilities \"must be real, significant, regular, and recurring.\" Mack A. Player, Employment Discrimination Law &#167; 4.11(b)(3), at 147-48 (1988). Nevertheless, it is reasonable to conclude that Dr. Quillen\\'s management of a department twice the size of Dr. Cullen\\'s is indicative of greater responsibility. See Howard v. Lear Corp. EEDS &amp; Interiors, 234 F.3d 1002, 1005 (7th Cir.2000) (\"The additional skill, effort, and headache involved in managing three to six times the number of workers in a more complex employment environment rendered the [] positions ... substantially different....\"); Orahood v. Board of Tr. of Univ. of Arkansas, 645 F.2d 651, 655 (8th Cir.1981) (affirming a finding of unequal positions because male employee supervised a much larger department with more employees).\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      The most significant factor in this responsibility comparison is the differential in tuition revenue generated by each program. Each school at the University must operate with budgets based on the tuition resources generated within the school. See R.75, Ex.27 at 31 &amp; 56. Significantly, Physical Therapy generates nearly 30% of SOAHS\\' tuition revenue, and the school would not be able to operate without a viable Physical Therapy Program. See R.68, Ex.2 at 137; R.68, Ex.20 at &#182; 12. In 1998-99, the Physical Therapy Program produced more than six times the tuition generated by Respiratory Therapy. See R.71, Ex.25 at 5. In Stanley v. University of Southern California, 13 F.3d 1313 (9th Cir.1994), the Ninth Circuit concluded that the additional pressure to win placed on the USC men\\'s basketball coach created a different job under the EPA because the men\\'s program generated ninety times more revenue than the women\\'s program. See id. at 1322-23. The court found that \"the relative amount of revenue generated should be considered in determining whether responsibilities and working conditions are substantially equal.\" Id. In this case, the SOAHS\\' dependence upon the revenue generated by the Physical Therapy Program creates additional pressure and responsibility on the Director of the Physical Therapy Program, Dr. Quillen. Consequently, the positions do not have equal levels of responsibility; therefore, Dr. Cullen cannot establish a prima facie case.3\\n    \\n    2. Pay Equity Study\\n    \\n      22\\n      Dr. Cullen contends that the district court erred by failing to consider the Pay Equity Study as evidence to prove her prima facie case under the EPA. She argues that, because she has identified a specific male comparator, Dr. Quillen, this court should adopt the Second Circuit\\'s rationale in Lavin-McEleney v. Marist College, 239 F.3d 476, 481 (2d Cir.2001), and permit her to rely on statistical evidence to support her prima facie case. In Lavin-McEleney, the Second Circuit held that \"statistical evidence of a gender-based salary disparity among comparable professors properly contributed to plaintiff\\'s case in conjunction with her identification of a specific male comparator.\"4 Id. The court specifically declined to decide whether statistical evidence alone would be sufficient to establish a prima facie case under the Equal Pay Act. See id. at 482. As we have discussed above, in Dr. Cullen\\'s case, Dr. Quillen is not a comparable male. Therefore, if she is to prevail, she must rely on statistics alone to support her prima facie case. We have noted that, in the Title VII context, statistical evidence of discrimination may be very useful, but \"it will likely not be sufficient in itself.\" Adams v. Ameritech Servs., Inc., 231 F.3d 414, 423 (7th Cir.2000).5 We need not decide today whether Dr. Cullen could base her prima facie EPA case solely on statistical evidence because the Pay Equity Study could not establish discrimination alone on these facts.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      The study was designed as the initial step in a two-part process of evaluating faculty for raises, not as a single quantitative measure of appropriate salaries. In fact, in order to ensure thoroughness, the University characterized Dr. Cullen as an \"outlier\" even though generally accepted principles of statistical modeling suggest that a figure less than two standard deviations is considered an acceptable deviation. See R.71, Ex.D at 28-29.6 Although the study sought to account for market forces by considering average national salaries for a given position, see R.71, Ex.D at 26-28, the study could not consider the significance of detailed individual facts such as those surrounding the University\\'s need to pay a premium to attract Dr. Quillen to accept a position as the director of a distressed program. Because of such particularized factors, the University determined that the Pay Equity Study would serve as a rough starting point to be followed by committee review. The Pay Equity Study was instructive in identifying faculty members deserving further review, but it cannot support a prima facie case of discrimination under the EPA.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      As a second step in the reevaluation of faculty pay, the University directed each school to establish a review panel to consider the individual characteristics of all outliers. In the SOAHS, the ad hoc review panel consisted of four women and one man, and it \"strongly recommend[ed] that an adjustment to [Dr. Cullen\\'s] base salary be made to rectify the salary inequity.\" R.71, Ex.11. The committee also found that Dr. Cullen\\'s salary increments were not significantly less than the averages for the SOAHS or Respiratory Therapy Program faculty and concluded that her salary increments reflected the school\\'s history of small salary increases. See id.\\n    \\n    3. Affirmative Defense\\n    \\n      25\\n      Assuming that Dr. Cullen had established a prima facie case, which she did not, the burden of persuasion shifts to the University to prove one of four statutory affirmative defenses. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 206(d)(1); Dey, 28 F.3d at 1462 (noting defendant bears burden of proof on affirmative defense). The University relies on the defense that there exists \"a differential based on any other factor other than sex.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 206(d)(1)(iv).\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Education is a relevant consideration in determining whether disparate salaries exist for reasons other than sex. See Covington v. Southern Illinois Univ., 816 F.2d 317, 323 n. 9 (7th Cir.1987). Dr. Cullen holds three degrees, and neither of her graduate degrees are in the field of Respiratory Therapy. See R.71, Ex.A at 13-20. Dr. Quillen holds five degrees, including a Ph.D. in Sports Medicine. See R.75, Ex.D. It is possible for an individual to earn a Ph.D. in Respiratory Therapy, but Dr. Cullen does not have such a degree. See R.71, Ex.A at 20. Dr. Quillen clearly holds more degrees with a focus in his respective discipline. This consideration supports the University\\'s position that this was a valid reason other than sex to pay Dr. Quillen more than Dr. Cullen.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      The University also focuses on market forces at the time of Dr. Quillen\\'s hiring. See Stanley, 13 F.3d at 1322 (\"An employer may consider the marketplace value of the skills of a particular individual when determining his or her salary.\"); Ross v. University of Texas at San Antonio, 139 F.3d 521, 526 (5th Cir.1998) (commenting that disparities were accounted for by market factors). At the time Dr. Quillen was hired, the Physical Therapy Program was on probation and any potential applicant for the position would be required to take over a foundering department, extricate it from probation by the accrediting body, and create a graduate program. See R.68, Ex.2 at 124-26. Faced with these responsibilities, the national applicant pool was small, and the University found it necessary to offer Dr. Quillen a significant salary to attract him to take the position.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      It is also notable that in 1999 Physical Therapy directors were paid $18,000 more than their peers in Respiratory Therapy, a disparity that increased to approximately $30,000 in 2001. See R.75, Ex.I. Additionally, in establishing a starting salary it is also appropriate to consider the salary a newly hired employee was receiving elsewhere. See Dey, 28 F.3d at 1462. Dr. Quillen was compensated in the \"high 80\\'s\" in his previous position. R.68, Ex.2 at 125-26.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      Moreover, as we have noted earlier, it is significant that Dr. Quillen is responsible for a department that generates six times as much revenue as Dr. Cullen\\'s and that is vital to the operation of SOAHS. See R.68, Ex.2 at 137; R.68, Ex.20 at &#182; 12; R.71, Ex.25 at 5. See also Player, Employment Discrimination Law &#167; 4.14(e)(2)(h), at 173-74 (\"An employer may provide different wage rates for the sale or production of products based upon the relative economic benefit or profitability of the product.\"). The University\\'s decision to compensate Dr. Quillen for the pressure imposed by this added responsibility constitutes another reason other than sex that explains his salary. Dr. Cullen has not provided sufficient evidence to place a material fact in dispute regarding the University\\'s affirmative defense that Dr. Cullen and Dr. Quillen were paid different salaries \"based on any other factor other than sex.\"7 29 U.S.C. &#167; 206(d)(1)(iv).\\n    \\n    B. Title VII\\n    \\n      30\\n      Having addressed Dr. Cullen\\'s arguments concerning the Equal Pay Act, we turn to her Title VII claim, for \"even if the plaintiff\\'s Equal Pay Act and Title VII claims [are] identical, Title VII is an independent remedy, in that it may be pursued in conjunction with other remedies.\" Schnellbaecher v. Baskin Clothing Co., 887 F.2d 124, 130 (7th Cir.1989) (citing Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 48-49, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974)); see County of Washington v. Gunther, 452 U.S. 161, 178-80, 101 S.Ct. 2242, 68 L.Ed.2d 751 (1981) (commenting that Title VII\\'s coverage of equal pay claims is broader than that of the EPA); Fallon v. Illinois, 882 F.2d 1206, 1218 (7th Cir.1989) (holding that the EPA and Title VII are distinct remedies). Dr. Cullen seeks to establish her Title VII claim by relying on indirect evidence of discrimination.8 Therefore, the burden-shifting paradigm of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), governs our analysis. See Haywood v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 323 F.3d 524, 531 (7th Cir.2003); Stone v. City of Indianapolis Pub. Util. Div., 281 F.3d 640, 644 (7th Cir.2002). In this context, to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination under Title VII, Dr. Cullen must show that 1) she was a member of a protected class, 2) she was meeting her employer\\'s legitimate expectations, 3) she suffered an adverse employment action, and 4) the employer treated a similarly situated man more favorably. See Johnson v. Zema Sys. Corp., 170 F.3d 734, 742-43 (7th Cir.1999); Morrow v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 152 F.3d 559, 561 (7th Cir.1998). If Dr. Cullen establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the University to provide legitimate reasons for the disparity. See Johnson v. University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, 70 F.3d 469, 478 (7th Cir.1995). If the University provides legitimate reasons, then Dr. Cullen must establish that the proffered reasons are pretextual. See id.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      Dr. Cullen cannot establish a prima facie case because she has not presented evidence of a similarly situated male that the University treated more favorably. Dr. Quillen is not a similarly situated male and, as discussed above, the Pay Equity Study is not sufficient to establish gender discrimination. Nevertheless, even if we assume that Dr. Cullen can establish her prima facie case, Dr. Cullen has failed to introduce sufficient evidence to create a material dispute regarding pretext. The University has provided unrebutted, non-discriminatory reasons for the pay disparity, including market forces at the time of Dr. Quillen\\'s hiring, different educational credentials, and differences in responsibility due to the larger amount of revenue generated by the Physical Therapy Department. Consequently, Dr. Cullen cannot prevail on her Title VII claim.\\n    \\n    Conclusion\\n    \\n      32\\n      The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\\n    \\n    AFFIRMED\\n    \\n      \\n        Notes:\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         The regulations are cast in very general terms in order to ensure general applicability throughout the economy. Consequently, in their application, a single factual consideration is often relevant to more than one of the criteria established by the regulations\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         The actual differences between educational pedigree are relevant in the affirmative defense of proving a pay differential based on \"any factor other than sex.\"See Covington v. Southern Illinois Univ., 816 F.2d 317, 323 n. 9 (7th Cir.1987).\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         The district court did not reach the issue of similar working conditions, but the University contends that Dr. Cullen cannot meet this requirement because Dr. Quillen was hired to extricate the Physical Therapy Program from probation, which is a dissimilar working condition. InCorning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974), the Supreme Court concluded that \"working conditions\" refers to physical surroundings and hazards encountered on the job. See id. at 202, 94 S.Ct. 2223; 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1620.18 (\"The term `similar working conditions\\' encompasses two subfactors: `surroundings\\' and `hazards.\\' `Surroundings\\' measure the elements, such as toxic chemicals or fumes, regularly encountered by a worker, their intensity and their frequency. `Hazards\\' take into account the physical hazards regularly encountered, their frequency and the severity of injury they can cause.\"). In this case, the parties have introduced no evidence that Dr. Cullen and Dr. Quillen are exposed to different physical surroundings or hazards in performing their duties, therefore they cannot be said to work under dissimilar conditions.\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         The University contends that, even if the court should consider statistics alone, the Pay Equity Study is not admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 andDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), in part, because certain critical factors such as productivity are difficult to quantify. However, this argument is not in accord with the Supreme Court\\'s discussion of regression analyses in Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986). In Justice Brennan\\'s concurring opinion in Bazemore, which was joined by all other members of the Court, he stated:\\n        While the omission of variables from a regression analysis may render the analysis less probative than it otherwise might be, it can hardly be said, absent some other infirmity, that an analysis which accounts for major factors \"must be considered unacceptable as evidence of discrimination.\" Normally, failure to include variables will affect the analysis\\' probativeness, not its admissibility.\\n        Id. at 400, 106 S.Ct. 3000 (Brennan, J., concurring) (citation omitted). See Rudebusch v. Hughes, 313 F.3d 506, 516 (9th Cir.2002) (citing Bazemore for the proposition that the \"propriety of controlling for particular variables in a regression analysis goes to weight rather than admissibility\"); Smith v. Virginia Commonwealth Univ., 84 F.3d 672, 676-77 (4th Cir.1996) (finding that disputes over excluded variables in multiple regression analysis are questions of material fact precluding summary judgment).\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         See also Rudebusch, 313 F.3d at 515-17 (concluding that a pay equity study finding 2.0 standard deviation among salaries was insufficient to establish discrimination in violation of Title VII in light of evidence that salaries fell below predicted levels across ethnic and gender lines); cf. Plemer v. Parsons-Gilbane, 713 F.2d 1127, 1135-36 (5th Cir.1983) (stating \"[i]t may well be questionable whether in an action grounded on a classic unequal pay for equal work claim, such statistics could ever suffice to make a prima facie case, if the proofs were otherwise insufficient for purposes of an individual Equal Pay Act or Title VII disparate treatment suit\").\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         See Adams v. Ameritech Servs., Inc., 231 F.3d 414, 424 (7th Cir.2000) (commenting that \"[t]wo standard deviations is normally enough to show that it is extremely unlikely... that the disparity is due to chance, giving rise to a reasonable inference that the hiring was not race-neutral; the more standard deviations away, the less likely the factor in question played no role in the decisionmaking process\"). But see Kadas v. MCI Systemhouse Corp., 255 F.3d 359, 362 (7th Cir.2001) (rejecting bright-line rule that would find statistical evidence of less than two standard deviations inadmissible).\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         Because Dr. Cullen cannot establish a prima facie case and because the University can establish an affirmative defense, we need not address Dr. Cullen\\'s contention that the University\\'s alleged violation of the EPA was willful\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         Moreover, a Title VII plaintiff must prove the intent to discriminate, specifically the \"actual desire to pay women less than men because they are women.\"Loyd v.

(ADEA), as well an an evaluation of the district court\\'s jury instructions.  The jury awarded Kelly damages for lost wages and pension benefits, business start-up costs, and emotional distress resulting from discharge by his employer.  The trial judge further awarded Kelly prejudgment interest and attorney fees, but denied liquidated damages.  We have concluded that, with a minor modification to the business start-up award, the jury verdict was proper.  Furthermore, the award of prejudgment interest was correct and is affirmed as modified in this opinion.  We conclude, however, that the trial judge applied an incorrect standard in denying liquidated damages, and remand to the district court for a redetermination of \"willfulness.\"  We also find that Kelly is entitled to attorney fees for this successful appeal, and leave calculation of the recoverable amount to the district court.FACTS:\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      Kelly was employed as a territory sales representative by the defendant-employer American Standard, Inc.  (American) from 1954 until July 1, 1975.  Because American sold its hydronics manufacturing plant, it decided to reduce its nationwide sales division personnel by forty employees, including one salesman from its Seattle sales district.  Kelly was the Seattle salesman discharged.  Kelly brought suit against American, alleging that his termination was a violation of the ADEA and the Washington State Law Against Discrimination (Wash.Rev.Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 49.60; 49.60.180(2) (Supp.1980)).  Kelly was 57 in 1975, and he contends that American terminated him because of his age, to make room for younger salesmen.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      The case was tried by a jury.  Kelly introduced statistical evidence tending to prove a pattern of age discrimination in American\\'s nationwide discharge plan.  Kelly also introduced evidence of American\\'s discriminatory intent.  He testified that American\\'s district sales manager told him that American planned to retain a younger man in Kelly\\'s position in Seattle, who would have \"many years to offer the company.\"  Kelly also testified that American\\'s vice president in charge of sales told him that the average age of salesmen was \"too high\" and that \"something had to be done about it.\"  American\\'s representatives denied that such statements were made, and testified that Kelly was terminated because he was the least effective member of the Seattle sales force.  The jury was instructed on both the state and federal age discrimination legislation, and returned a verdict in favor of Kelly.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      The jury awarded total damages of $48,500; including $25,000 for lost income, $2,000 for lost pension benefits, $6,500 for business start-up costs, and $15,000 for mental suffering.  By agreement of the parties, the court rather than the jury determined the availability and amount of liquidated damages, prejudgment interest, and attorney fees.  The court awarded prejudgment interest of 8% on $27,000, and attorney fees of $14,000.  However, it denied Kelly\\'s request for liquidated damages under the ADEA, finding that American had not acted \"willfully\" under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b), and further finding that the \"good faith\" defense of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 260 applied.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      American appeals the trial court\\'s award of prejudgment interest to Kelly.  American also appeals the jury verdict in favor of Kelly, contending that damages for emotional distress are not available under state or federal law, and that the jury instructions were erroneous or incomplete in several respects.  Kelly cross-appeals, contending that liquidated damages were improperly denied, and that he is entitled to attorney fees on appeal.  The issue of the ADEA violation itself is not directly raised on this appeal, except insofar as American challenges the district court jury instructions.\\n    \\n    I. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES\\n    A. ADEA Enforcement\\n    \\n      6\\n      The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer \"to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual ... because of such individual\\'s age.\"1 This proscription is enforced through express incorporation of the remedial rights and procedures of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), rather than through independent ADEA remedies.  Section 7(b) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b), provides that its provisions \"shall be enforced in accordance with the powers, remedies, and procedures provided in sections 11(b), 16 ... and 17 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended ....\"2 Pursuant to those statutes, an employer who violates the ADEA is liable for back wages and benefits, as well as \"an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.\"3\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      The jury awarded Kelly $27,000 in lost wages and pension benefits, but Judge Neill denied Kelly\\'s request for liquidated damages in an equal amount because he found no evidence that American\\'s violation was \"willful,\" and because he concluded that the \"good faith\" defense of section 11 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 260, applied to American\\'s conduct.4 It is first necessary to determine whether the trial court properly found that American did not act willfully.\\n    \\n    B. The Willfulness Standard\\n    \\n      8\\n      The apparently automatic provision for liquidated damages in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b) is modified by 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b), providing that such damages will only be awarded \"in cases of willful violations of this chapter ....\" Neither the Act nor its legislative history defines \"willful.\"  Kelly contends that the test applied by the district court places too high a burden on ADEA plaintiffs.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      The court below stated that for a willful violation, \"there must be proof that defendant intentionally and knowingly fired plaintiff, with the knowledge that their acts had implications under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.\"  Because Kelly presented no evidence of American\\'s knowledge of ADEA implications, liquidated damages were denied.  The district court relied on Hays v. Republic Steel Corp., 531 F.2d 1307 (5th Cir. 1976), in support of the conclusion that a defendant must have knowledge of ADEA implications for a plaintiff to recover liquidated damages.5\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      In fact, the Hays court did not consider or decide this question.  The only reference to the issue in the court\\'s opinion is a quote from the trial court which cited Coleman v. Jiffy June Farms, Inc., 458 F.2d 1139 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 948, 93 S. Ct. 292, 34 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1972).  Coleman required knowledge of implications under the FLSA to show willfulness.  The Coleman court, however, was not interpreting the term \"willful\" in the liquidated damage provision of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b), but was concerned with 29 U.S.C. &#167; 255(a), which establishes the statute of limitations for FLSA actions.  The limitation period is two years unless the employer\\'s actions are willful, in which case the limitation period is three years.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Coleman is not on point here.  The statute of limitations interpreted in Coleman is designed to prevent an employer with knowledge of FLSA from delaying a lawsuit by misleading its employee as to his or her rights.  See Brennan v. Heard, 491 F.2d 1, 3 (5th Cir. 1974).  The employer would only have reason to mislead or delay an employee when it knew that its actions were possibly violative of an employment act.6\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      In contrast the award of liquidated damages is in effect a substitution for punitive damages and is intended to deter intentional violations of the ADEA.  Dean v. American Security Insurance Co., 559 F.2d 1036, 1039-40 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1066, 98 S. Ct. 1243, 55 L. Ed. 2d 767 (1978); Douglas v. American Cyanamid Co., 472 F. Supp. 298, 303 (D.C.Conn.1979).  Courts awarding liquidated damages have not required proof of an employer\\'s knowledge of the Act, but have looked only to the knowing and voluntary nature of the violation.  Buchholz v. Symons Manufacturing Co., 445 F. Supp. 706, 713 (E.D.Wis.1978) (willfulness found because violation was \"intentional, knowing and voluntary\"); Rogers v. Exxon Research &amp; Engineering Co., 404 F. Supp. 324, 334 (D.N.J.1975), rev\\'d on other grounds, 550 F.2d 834 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1022, 98 S. Ct. 749, 54 L. Ed. 2d 770 (1978) (\"careless disregard\" of whether employer had a right to act as it did).\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      A version of the \"knowing and voluntary\" standard was recently adopted in a well-reasoned opinion of the Third Circuit. Wehr v. Burroughs Corp., 619 F.2d 276 (3d Cir. 1980).  The Wehr court upheld an award of liquidated damages based on a jury instruction that the employer must act \"deliberately, intentionally, and knowingly.\"7 The court noted that \"willful\" is subject to many interpretations, and stressed the importance of a lower standard for civil, as opposed to criminal, statutes using the term. 619 F.2d at 282 (no specific intent should be required); accord Hodgson v. Hyatt, 318 F. Supp. 390 (N.D.Fla.1970).\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      American argues that a lower standard than that imposed by the trial court, such as the Wehr approach, would render liquidated damages automatic.8 This argument ignores the fact that an employer\\'s act may still violate the ADEA, and not be knowing and voluntary.  See Walker v. Pettit Construction Co., 605 F.2d 128, 131 (4th Cir.), modified sub nom., Frith v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 611 F.2d 950 (1979).  To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, a plaintiff need only prove:\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      (1) his membership in the protected class, (2) his discharge, (3) his qualifications for the position, and (4) his replacement by one outside the protected class.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Houser v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 627 F.2d 756, 757 (5th Cir. 1980).  Thus, in order to establish a basis for liability there is no requirement that a plaintiff introduce evidence of the defendant\\'s state of mind.9\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      Furthermore, proof sufficient to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination does not necessarily establish the same inference of improper motive as under a Title VII disparate treatment case.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      (T)he aging process causes employees constantly to exit the labor market while younger ones enter, simply the replacement of an older employee by a younger worker does not raise the same inference of improper motive that attends replacement of a black by a white person in a Title VII case.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      Marshall v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 554 F.2d 730, 736 (5th Cir. 1977).  The fact that Congress provided for special remedies in the case of willful violations implies that an employee can recover for accidental and unintended violations of the ADEA as well as those that are knowing or intentional.  Smith v. University of North Carolina, 632 F.2d 316, 337 (4th Cir. 1980).\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      To require \"knowledge of implications under the Act\" could have the anomalous effect of encouraging employers to know as little as possible about the ADEA so that they would not be liable for liquidated damages.  We conclude that the standard expressed by the Third Circuit in Wehr will best effectuate the purposes of ADEA, and hold that an ADEA plaintiff who establishes a knowing and voluntary violation of the Act is entitled to liquidated damages under 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 216(b) and 626(b).\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      In addition to statistical evidence, Kelly testified to discriminatory statements made by American\\'s employees.  Both types of evidence might establish willfulness under a \"knowing and voluntary\" standard, entitling him to liquidated damages.  On the other hand the trial court might find that the discrimination was inadvertent.  See Smith v. University of North Carolina, 632 F.2d 316, 337 (4th Cir. 1980).  We must therefore remand to the district court to determine the availability of liquidated damages under the standard we have approved.\\n    \\n    C. The Good Faith Defense\\n    \\n      22\\n      As an alternative ground for denying liquidated damages, the trial court found that the good faith defense in section 11 of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 260, applies to ADEA actions, and was met by American because it had business justifications for the termination. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 260 provides in part:\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      (I)f the employer shows to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, the court may, in its sound discretion, award no liquidated damages or award any amount thereof not to exceed the amount specified in section 216 of this title.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      The ADEA incorporates the enforcement scheme of FLSA by referring specifically to sections 211, 216 and 217; it does not refer to the Portal-to-Portal Act.  The Portal-to-Portal Act was enacted sometime before the ADEA.  If Congress had intended section 11 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 260, to apply in ADEA actions it seems clear that it would also have been specifically incorporated by reference in &#167; 626(b).  Nevertheless, several courts have held that section 260 should apply to the ADEA as well as to the FLSA.  Hays v. Republic Steel Corp., 531 F.2d 1307 (5th Cir. 1976); Combes v. Griffin Television, Inc., 421 F. Supp. 841 (W.D.Okl.1976).  The trial judge in the instant case relied on Hays in applying the defense.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      The rationale of the courts allowing the defense is that the ADEA should incorporate all of the FLSA remedies.  The Hays court also expressed concern over automatically providing for liquidated damages, preferring trial court discretion. 531 F.2d at 1311.  At the time of trial, Hays was the only circuit court case that had addressed this issue and the district courts were split.10\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      The two most recent cases to consider the issue, noting that Hays is the only appellate authority to the contrary, hold that the good faith defense of &#167; 260 is not available.  Wehr v. Burroughs Corp., 619 F.2d 276, 279 (3d Cir. 1980); Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1020 (1st Cir. 1979).  Under section 216(b), the applicable FLSA provision, there is no requirement of willfulness as a predicate to an award of liquidated damages.  On the other hand, the ADEA requires a finding of willfulness for liquidated damages. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b).  The Loeb court reasoned that the \"willfulness\" requirement specifically added to the ADEA indicates that the good faith defense is not necessary:\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      (U)nder 29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b), standing alone, liquidated damages must be awarded once a violation is shown.  Section 11 (29 U.S.C. &#167; 260) mitigates this result in FLSA cases (citations).  In ADEA cases, the \"willfulness\" test serves the same function and renders Section 11 superfluous.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      600 F.2d at 1020.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      The Loeb analysis is supported by the recent Supreme Court decision establishing the right to jury trials in ADEA actions.  Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 98 S. Ct. 866, 55 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1978).  The Court stated that \"(a) lthough &#167; 7(e) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(e), expressly incorporates &#167;&#167; 6 and 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Pay Act (29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 255 and 259) ..., the ADEA does not make any reference to &#167; 11, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 260 ....\"11 We find this reasoning persuasive and hold that the good faith defense to liquidated damage recovery is not applicable in ADEA actions.  There would be little purpose in allowing an employer who has willfully violated the ADEA to show that it nevertheless acted in \"good faith.\"  Indeed, it is hard to imagine a situation where a court could find a willful violation to still be in good faith.  Loeb, 600 F.2d at 1020.  Therefore upon remand the district judge should apply the willfulness standard discussed above, and ignore the good faith defense in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 260.\\n    \\n    II. PREJUDGMENT INTEREST\\n    \\n      30\\n      The ADEA empowers a court \"to grant such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter ....\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b).  On this basis, the district court awarded Kelly prejudgment interest on his $27,000 lost income and pension recovery, at the rate of eight percent from the date of discharge.  Kelly concedes that the court improperly used an eight percent rate, and that the correct rate should be six percent under the Washington statute.  Because the rate is not disputed, we will assume that the parties are correct and we apply the six percent rate.12\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      There is ample authority supporting awards of prejudgment interest in FLSA cases.  McClanahan v. Mathews, 440 F.2d 320, 324-26 (6th Cir. 1971); Holtville Alfalfa Mills v. Wyatt, 230 F.2d 398, 401 (9th Cir. 1955).  FLSA cases involve recovery for labor previously performed.  An ADEA claim, on the other hand, requires reimbursement for wages lost after termination of employment.  Under the provisions of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b), however, any amounts recoverable under ADEA are \"deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime ... (as in FLSA).\"  Therefore, the FLSA cases are directly applicable; Kelly\\'s lost wages were accrued and owing by virtue of section 626(b).  See Hodgson v. First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\\'n, 455 F.2d 818, 820 (5th Cir. 1972).  In assuring equitable relief under the ADEA, the loss of use of this money during the period payments were withheld from Kelly should be compensated by payment of interest.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      American contends that Washington law precludes interest recovery because at time of trial, Kelly\\'s recovery was not \"liquidated.\"  See Boeing Co. v. State, 89 Wash.2d 443, 572 P.2d 8, 14-15 (1978); Prier v. Refrigeration Engineering Co., 74 Wash.2d 25, 442 P.2d 621, 626 (1968).  The trial court granted interest only on Kelly\\'s pecuniary wage and pension loss of $27,000, not on the more speculative element of damage for emotional distress.  Federal case law provides a set formula for determining back wages and other pecuniary damages in an ADEA case; the award is not left entirely to the jury\\'s subjective opinion.  Loeb v. Textron, 600 F.2d 1003, 1021 (1st Cir. 1979).  Therefore, even if Washington law applied we would conclude that the claim was liquidated.  But in any event it is not necessary to address American\\'s state law contentions because prejudgment interest is allowable under federal law.  The award of interest was proper, and serves to furnish Kelly an equitable recovery for his lost wages and pension benefits.13\\n    \\n    III. DAMAGES FOR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS\\n    \\n      33\\n      At trial, the jury awarded Kelly $15,000 for emotional distress caused by American\\'s termination.  The federal district courts are in conflict over the availability of compensatory damages such as emotional distress in an ADEA action, although the circuit courts which have addressed this issue have uniformly denied recovery.14 Emotional distress, however, is an appropriate element of damage recovery under the Washington State Law Against Discrimination, upon which the jury was instructed.  Wash.Rev.Code Ann. &#167; 49.60 (Supp.1980).  We therefore affirm the award on the basis of Kelly\\'s pendent state law claim, and do not consider the scope of available compensatory claim damages under the ADEA.\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      The Washington statute provides that a person \"injured by any act in violation of this chapter shall have a civil action ... to recover the actual damages sustained by him ....\"15 A recent Washington case, interpreting this language in a sex discrimination case, held that actual damages include \"impairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.\"  Ellingson v. Spokane Mortgage Co., 19 Wash.App. 48, 573 P.2d 389, 394 (1978) (quoting Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 350, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 3012, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974) (defamation case)).  There is no reason why the Washington discrimination law should be interpreted any differently in an age discrimination case; the remedial provision of Wash.Rev.Code Ann. &#167; 49.60.030(2) (Supp.1980) is the same for age discrimination as well as sex discrimination under Washington\\'s statutory scheme.  The nature and amount of recovery are questions of fact,16 therefore the district court did not err in leaving the award of damages for emotional distress to the jury.\\n    \\n    IV. JURY INSTRUCTIONS AND VERDICT\\n    \\n      35\\n      American challenges several aspects of the district court jury instructions.\\n    \\n    A. Age As A Determining Factor\\n    \\n      36\\n      In jury instruction 9, the judge stated that the plaintiff has the burden of proving that \"one of the reasons he was terminated was because of his age ...,\" and that he should prevail if this factor \"made a difference in determining whether or not the plaintiff was retained or discharged.\"  The judge relied on Laugesen v. Anaconda Co., 510 F.2d 307, 317 (6th Cir. 1975), which first established the \"determining factor\" test.\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      American argues that Laugesen is an incorrect interpretation of the ADEA and that age must be the sole factor.  It contends that otherwise 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(f)(1), which provides that it shall not be unlawful to take otherwise prohibited actions \"where age is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business, or where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age,\" would be superfluous.  American, however, ignores the fact that age may be one of many \"reasonable factors\" but not a determining one.  The relationship between the defense in section 623(f)(1) and the determining factor test was recently examined by the Fourth Circuit.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      Such a prima facie showing (by the employee-plaintiff) is rebutted if the employer shows a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the employee\\'s discharge.  (citations)\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      After the employer has come forward with such evidence, the ultimate burden of persuasion remains upon the plaintiff to show that age was a determining factor in his discharge.\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      Smith v. Flax, 618 F.2d 1062, 1066 (4th Cir. 1980) (footnote omitted); see 29 C.F.R. &#167; 860.103(c) (1980).  Only when age is a determining factor in the discharge will the ADEA be violated, and in such a case any other factors under section 623(f)(1) will be irrelevant.\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      In this case American contended that Kelly was selected for termination because he was the least effective member of the sales force, and not because of his age.  If the jury had so found, the discharge of Kelly would have been based on a reasonable factor other than age.  Whether age was a determining factor was a question of fact to be resolved by the jury.  Smith, 618 F.2d at 1066; 29 C.F.R. &#167; 860.103(b)-(d).\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      We agree with the recent First Circuit case reaffirming a \"determining factor\" or \"but for\" test as proper under the ADEA.  Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1019 (1st Cir. 1979).  To require an ADEA plaintiff to prove that age was the sole factor would impose an intolerable burden; \"business\" justifications for discharge can always be asserted.  Jury instruction 9 set forth the same test as that endorsed by Laugesen and Loeb, and a stricter test is not warranted under the ADEA or interpretive case law.17\\n    \\n    B. \"Reasonable Factors\" Instruction\\n    \\n      43\\n      American contends that the trial judge should have included defendant\\'s proposed instruction 5, which stated that a discharge is not unlawful if \"for good cause or where the discharge or classification is based on reasonable factors other than age.\"  This instruction is an appropriate paraphrasing of the \"reasonable factors\" exception in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(f)(1), but was unnecessary in this case because jury instruction 9 included the same language.  There is no reason that this exception merits highlighting in a separate instruction.18\\n    \\n    \\n      44\\n      C. Instruction On The Weight Of Kelly\\'s Testimony\\n    \\n    \\n      45\\n      As a further assignment of error, American contends that the trial judge should have included defendant\\'s proposed jury instruction 16, which stated that a party\\'s testimony on alleged out of court admissions should be \"considered with caution and weighed with great care.\"  Given the inherently self-serving nature of Kelly\\'s testimony, such an instruction may have been appropriate.  However, failure to include the instruction was not error.\\n    \\n    \\n      46\\n      The jury was carefully instructed on its fact-finding function, and was competent to weigh the veracity of Kelly\\'s statements with the testimony of other witnesses.  Jury instruction 8, 14, and 16 covered the preponderance of the evidence standard, plaintiff\\'s burden of proof, the veracity of witness testimony, and factors to consider in weighing testimony, including motive and state of mind.  Instruction 16 specifically asked the jury to \"(c)onsider also any relation each witness may bear to either side of the case; (and) the manner in which each witness might be affected by the verdict ....\" Taken as a whole, the jury instructions were not misleading or unfair to American.  Laugesen, 510 F.2d at 315.\\n    \\n    \\n      47\\n      D. Reduction In The Verdict To Conform To The Evidence\\n    \\n    \\n      48\\n      The jury award of pecuniary damages was slightly higher than the figures testified to by Kelly\\'s expert witness, Dr. Barnes.  Barnes calculated Kelly\\'s income loss at $24,541.87, his pension loss at $1,241.51, and his business start-up costs at $6,248.50, for a total of $32,031.88.  The jury awarded Kelly $25,000, $2,000, and $6,500 respectively, for a total of $33,500.  The jury apparently accepted Dr. Barnes\\' testimony, and rounded each figure up to an even amount, resulting in a total discrepancy of $1,462.12 between the testimony and the verdict.\\n    \\n    \\n      49\\n      This discrepancy does not mean that the verdict was inconsistent with the testimony, however.  Barnes never claimed that his figures on the income and pension losses were exact.  His total estimate of $25,783.38 for these two items was based on a \"conservative\" average yearly increase of 4.8%, which he testified could have been as high as 8.35%.19 Therefore, the jury award of $27,000 for these two amounts was well within the range of the expert testimony.  This uncertainty was not present for Barnes\\' estimate of business start-up costs, and Kelly has conceded that the award of $6,500 should be reduced to $6,248.50.  The jury verdict is therefore affirmed, with a $251.50 reduction to conform to the testimonial evidence.20 We find the instructions to be an accurate and complete statement of the relevant law and affirm the jury verdict of ADEA discrimination, with the minor modification above.\\n    \\n    V. ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\\n    \\n      50\\n      Kelly has requested this court to award attorney fees for successful prosecution of this appeal.21 Although there is a statutory authorization for trial level attorney fees in the ADEA, a grant of fees on appeal is in the discretion of the appellate court.  Cleverly v. Western Electric Co., 594 F.2d 638, 643 (8th Cir. 1979).  It is clear that such an award is available in an FLSA case, and for the same reasons is appropriate in an ADEA case.  Montalvo v. Tower Life Building, 426 F.2d 1135, 1150 (5th Cir. 1970) (FLSA); see also Rodriguez v. Taylor, 569 F.2d 1231, 1250 n.34 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 913, 98 S. Ct. 2254, 56 L. Ed. 2d 414 (1978) (remand to trial court to determine proper amount in an ADEA case).  An appellate court should grant attorney\\'s fees on appeal in an ADEA case when the complexity of the issues and the time necessary to master those issues warrants reimbursement to the prevailing party.  Montalvo, 426 F.2d at 1150.\\n    \\n    \\n      51\\n      We find substantial merit in Kelly\\'s request.  After successfully challenging American\\'s discharge at the trial level, he has defended the verdict on appeal and convinced this court to remand for a redetermination of liquidated damages.  Many of the issues raised on this appeal involve complex questions of first impression in this circuit.  We therefore grant Kelly\\'s request for appellate attorney fees, but remand to the district court to determine the appropriate amount.  In making this determination, the district court should consider the number of hours spent in preparation, the experience of the attorneys, the number and complexity of the issues, and the degree of wasted or duplicative effort.  See generally Rodriguez, 569 F.2d at 1247-50; Wehr v. Burroughs Corp., 477 F. Supp. 1012 (E.D.Pa.1979), aff\\'d as modified, 619 F.2d 276 (3d Cir. 1980).  We also believe that consideration should be given to the customary fees charged for equivalent litigation services in the community.  Rodriguez, 569 F.2d at 1248 (fee calculation for legal service attorneys); Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 718 (5th Cir. 1974).\\n    \\n    CONCLUSION\\n    \\n      52\\n      The district court\\'s jury instructions were an accurate reflection of the law, and provided adequate guidance for a fair verdict.  Furthermore, although recovery of damages for emotional distress is unclear under the ADEA, Washington state law allows for such recovery.  Therefore, we affirm the jury verdict in its entirety, with a reduction in the business start-up award from $6,500 to $6,248.50 in order to conform to the testimonial evidence.\\n    \\n    \\n      53\\n      The district court award of prejudgment interest was a proper form of equitable relief and is affirmed as modified to a six percent rate.  We find, however, that the court below applied too high a standard in denying liquidated damages and remand for a redetermination under a \"knowing and voluntary\" standard of willfulness.  Finally, we find that Kelly is entitled to an award of attorney fees for successful prosecution of this appeal, and remand to the district court to determine the appropriate amount.\\n    \\n    \\n      54\\n      AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED and REMANDED IN PART.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        *\\n         Honorable Francis L. Van Dusen, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(a) provides:\\n        (a) It shall be unlawful for an employer\\n        (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\\'s age;\\n        (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\\'s age; or\\n        (3) to reduce the wage rate of any employee in order to comply with this chapter.\\n        As stated in section 2(b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 621(b), the ADEA was passed to \"promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age ....\" The Act prohibits employers from discriminating in hiring, promotion or discharge, against those between 40 and 70 years old. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 631(a).  There are situations where disparate treatment of older workers is not unlawful, notably where age is a \"bona fide occupational qualification,\" or where differentiation is based on \"reasonable factors other than age.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(f)(1).  In the instant case, American does not dispute that it violated the ADEA if the court\\'s instructions to the jury were correct.  The issues on this appeal involve recoverable damages, and trial court jury instructions.\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         As codified, the Act provides in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b):\\n        (b) The provisions of this chapter shall be enforced in accordance with the powers, remedies, and procedures provided in sections 211(b), 216 (except for subsection (a) thereof), and 217 of this title, and subsection (c) of this section.  Any act prohibited under section 623 of this title shall be deemed to be a prohibited act under section 215 of this title.  Amounts owing to a person as a result of a violation of this chapter shall be deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation for purposes of sections 216 and 217 of this title: Provided, That liquidated damages shall be payable only in cases of willful violations of this chapter.  In any action brought to enforce this chapter the court shall have jurisdiction to grant such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including without limitation judgments compelling employment, reinstatement or promotion, or enforcing the liability for amounts deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under this section.  Before instituting any action under this section, the Secretary shall attempt to eliminate the discriminatory practice or practices alleged, and to effect voluntary compliance with the requirements of this chapter through informal methods of conciliation, conference, and persuasion.\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b) provides:\\n        (b) Any employer who violates the provisions of section 206 or section 207 of this title shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.  Any employer who violates the provisions of section 215(a)(3) of this title shall be liable for such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of section 215(a)(3) of this title, including without limitation employment, reinstatement, promotion, and the payment of wages lost and an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.  An action to recover the liability prescribed in either of the preceding sentences may be maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.  No employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.  The court in such action shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney\\'s fee to be paid by the defendant, and costs of the action.  The right provided by this subsection to bring an action by or on behalf of any employee, and the right of any employee to become a party plaintiff to any such action, shall terminate upon the filing of a complaint by the Secretary of Labor in an action under section 217 of this title in which (1) restraint is sought of any further delay in the payment of unpaid minimum wages, or the amount of unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, owing to such employee under section 206 or section 207 of this title by an employer liable therefor under the provisions of this subsection or (2) legal or equitable relief is sought as a result of alleged violations of section 215(a)(3) of this title.\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         The parties stipulated to a judicial determination of liquidated damages, although the right to a jury trial on ADEA damage issues has largely been settled by Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 98 S. Ct. 866, 55 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1978)\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         We are aware of only two other decisions which might imply such a standard.  In Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1020 n.27 (1st Cir. 1979), the court cited a jury instruction handbook which suggests that some form of \"specific intent\" to disregard the law is required.  However, the precise issue was not before the court.  The only other liquidated damage case we can find that requires something beyond \"knowing and voluntary\" is Coates v. National Cash Register Co., 433 F. Supp. 655, 664 (W.D.Va.1977).  As discussed in the text most courts that have discussed the issue have only required a knowing and voluntary violation\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         Most courts interpreting the term \"willful\" in the statute of limitations context have required knowledge of the implications under FLSA or ADEA.  Olsen v. Southern Pac.  Transp. Co., 480 F. Supp. 773, 778-79 (N.D.Cal.1979); Bishop v. Jelleff Assoc., 398 F. Supp. 579, 593 (D.D.C.1974).  This interpretation is consistent with the FLSA because &#167; 255 is designed to prevent an employer with knowledge of the FLSA from delaying an employee\\'s lawsuit\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         Wehr v. Burroughs Corp., 619 F.2d 276, 280 (3d Cir. 1980).  The Wehr court stated, in dicta, that even the quoted instructions established too high a standard, and that reckless violations should also give rise to liquidated damages liability.  Id. at 283.  We decline to extend the punitive provision of double recovery beyond knowing violations\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         See Smith &amp; Leggette, Recent Issues in Litigation Under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 41 Ohio St.L.J. 349, 369 (1980) (hereinafter cited as \"Smith &amp; Leggette\")\\n      \\n      \\n        9\\n         Kelly introduced sufficient statistical evidence to establish a prima facie case.  This evidence consisted of three exhibits, prepared by American in response to interrogatories, which listed each member of the sales force, their ages and dates of service, and those employees terminated as a result of the hydronics plant closure.  A plaintiff can rely on statistical evidence alone to establish the discriminatory impact of an employer\\'s selection criteria.  Geller v. Markham, 635 F.2d 1027 (2d Cir. 1981)\\n        Statistical proof of discrimination is often the only evidence available to a discharged employee.  Cf. Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 329, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 1851, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1977).  It is not necessary to show that the ADEA violation was \"conscious.\" \"(T)he ADEA is designed to eradicate both conscious and unconscious stereotypes about the abilities of older workers.  The proscriptions of the Act are not limited to employers who know that age is the reason why they are treating older workers unfavorably.\"  Smith &amp; Leggette, supra, note 8, at 371 (footnotes omitted).\\n      \\n      \\n        10\\n         Several district courts have held that the defense is not applicable in ADEA actions, because &#167; 260 was not incorporated into &#167; 626(b).  Rechsteiner v. Madison Fund, Inc., 75 F.R.D. 499, 504-05 (D.Del.1977); Cleverly v. Western Electric Co., 69 F.R.D. 348, 352 (W.D.Mo.1975).  But see McGregor v. CCH Computax, Inc., 463 F. Supp. 1215, 1216 (C.D.Cal.1979) (applying the defense without discussing its reasoning); Combes v. Griffin Television, Inc., 421 F. Supp. 841, 844 (W.D.Okl.1976)\\n      \\n      \\n        11\\n         Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 581 n.8, 98 S. Ct. 866, 870 n.8, 55 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1978).  See also Smith &amp; Leggette, supra, note 8, at 369 n.182\\n      \\n      \\n        12\\n         The district court apparently applied the 8% rate because of Wash.Rev.Code Ann. &#167; 4.56.110 (Supp.1980), providing for post-judgment interest (from the date of entry).  The general 6% rate in Wash.Rev.Code Ann. &#167; 19.52.010 should apply in lieu of a more specific statute.  Because the parties have agreed on 6%, we need not determine whether it was appropriate to look to the state statute when the award of interest itself is based on the \"equitable relief\" language in the federal statute. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b)\\n      \\n      \\n        13\\n         The broad equitable relief language in section 626(b) has been used by some district courts as justification for awards of punitive damages or emotional distress recovery.  Other courts, however, have held that the apparently broad language of &#167; 626(b) is limited to relief related to the pecuniary damages specifically provided for under ADEA and FLSA.  Slatin v. Stanford Research Institute, 590 F.2d 1292, 1296 (4th Cir. 1979); see cases in note 14 infra\\n        An award of prejudgment interest is justified under either interpretation because the equitable relief phrase of section 626(b) is directly followed by authorization for back pay under section 216.  Prejudgment interest merely protects the value of authorized backpay pending trial.\\n      \\n      \\n        14\\n         We are not aware of any circuit court allowing recovery under ADEA for emotional distress.  District courts granting such recovery generally rely on the equitable relief phrase in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b).  See note 13 supra.  A partial list of district court cases allowing recovery for emotional distress or punitive damages includes: Wise v. Olan Mills, Inc., 485 F. Supp. 542, 544 (D.Colo.1980); Hassan v. Delta Orthopedic Medical Group, Inc., 476 F. Supp. 1063, 1065 (E.D.Cal.1979); Morton v. Sheboygan Memorial Hosp., 458 F. Supp. 804, 807 (E.D.Wis.1978); Kennedy v. Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 449 F. Supp. 1008, 1009-11 (D.Colo.1978); Buchholz v. Symons Mfg. Co., 445 F. Supp. 706, 713-14 (E.D.Wis.1978); Bertrand v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 419 F. Supp. 1123, 1132-33 (N.D.Ill.1976).  See also Smith &amp; Leggette, supra, note 8, at 366-68\\n        The four circuits that have addressed the issue have all denied recovery for emotional distress, reasoning that the statutory scheme of reinstatement, lost wages and benefits, liquidated damages and attorney fees is sufficient to make the plaintiff whole.  See Wehr v. Burroughs Corp., 619 F.2d 276, 284 (3d Cir. 1980); Walker v. Pettit Const. Co., 605 F.2d 128, 129-30 (4th Cir. 1979); Slatin v.

Supp. 621, 622 (N.D.Cal.1976).\\n      \\n      \\n        15\\n         Wash.Rev.Code Ann. &#167; 49.60.030(2) (Supp.1980).  One of the specified violations in the chapter is the \"discharge or bar (of) any person from employment because of such person\\'s age ....\" Wash.Rev.Code Ann. &#167; 40.60.180(2) (Supp.1980) (unfair practices of employer defined).  Therefore, violation of this provision brings into play the civil remedy for \"actual damages\" in Wash.Rev.Code Ann. &#167; 49.60.030(2) (Supp.1980).  See Sarruf v. Miller, 90 Wash.2d 794, 586 P.2d 466, 468 (1978)\\n      \\n      \\n        16\\n         American contends that the pain and suffering award should nevertheless be reversed because the trial judge did not instruct the jury on the standard for granting such recovery under Washington law.  The instruction merely stated that a verdict for Kelly \"should include ... (4) Emotional distress.\"  American\\'s proposed instruction required a showing of \"outrageous and extreme conduct\" by the defendant\\n        The two cases American cites for this high standard, however, establish the elements of a prima facie case for the common law tort of outrage, and do not involve damage recovery under a statutory tort.  Contreras v. Crown Zellerbach Corp., 88 Wash.2d 735, 565 P.2d 1173 (1977); Grimsby v. Samson, 85 Wash.2d 52, 530 P.2d 291 (1975).  We are not aware of any Washington case holding that an additional showing to recover for emotional distress is required for a statutory violation.\\n        Although the award was based solely on the testimony of Kelly and his wife, the jury was competent to weigh the credibility of these witnesses; apparently they were persuasive.  There is no merit to American\\'s contention that a $15,000 award was excessive, in light of $33,500 pecuniary damages.\\n      \\n      \\n        17\\n         The strong weight of authority supports some formulation of the determining factor test.  See Smithers v. Bailar, 629 F.2d 892, 896-97 (4th Cir. 1980); Smith v. Flax, 618 F.2d 1062, 1066 (4th Cir. 1980); Goldman v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 607 F.2d 1014, 1019 (1st Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 929, 100 S. Ct. 1317, 53 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1980) (ADEA and Title VII); Cleverly v. Western Elec. Co., 594 F.2d 638, 641 (8th Cir. 1979); Olsen v. Southern Pac.  Transp. Co., 480 F. Supp. 773, 779 n.4 (N.D.Cal.1979).  See also Smith &amp; Leggette, supra, note 8, at 371-72.  But see Brennan v. Reynolds &amp; Co., 367 F. Supp. 440, 444 (N.D.Ill.1973)\\n      \\n      \\n        18\\n         Although inclusion of American\\'s proposed language in a separate instruction would have been proper, exclusion was equally proper.  The jury instructions as a whole included the elements of a prima facie case under ADEA, as well as applicable defenses and exceptions. \"If the judge\\'s instructions properly present the issues and the law as applicable, it is no ground for complaint that certain portions, taken by themselves and isolated, may appear to be ambiguous, incomplete, or otherwise subject to criticism.\"  Laugesen v. Anaconda Co., 510 F.2d 307, 315 (6th Cir. 1975)\\n      \\n      \\n        19\\n         Dr. Clarence Barnes, an economics professor, was the only expert offered by either party on the issue of damages.  He based his calculations on Kelly\\'s tax returns, interrogatories from both parties, copies of American\\'s pension program, and Kelly\\'s past sales and earning experience.  On direct examination, he testified to Kelly\\'s projected salary increase as follows:\\n        Well, I took earnings increases from 1967 through 1974, for the 4.8(%). Now, that was, I also applied that same procedure to total earnings increases from 1962 through 1974, and then 1970 through 1974, and found that those were, I believe, 8.35(%) increase per year, and 6.11 percent increase per year, so I chose the smaller of the three, to be conservative.\\n      \\n      \\n        20\\n         American also contends that the jury instruction regarding Kelly\\'s life insurance and vested pension rights was irrelevant and prejudicial, possibly influencing the jury to inflate the verdict.  This contention is not well taken; American stipulated to these facts as admitted in the pretrial order, and cannot now contest them.  Furthermore, pension rights and fringe benefits are proper elements of damage under the ADEA, and their present value is recoverable based on expert testimony.  Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1021 (1st Cir. 1979)\\n      \\n      \\n        21\\n         Kelly was awarded $14,000 in attorney fees for his successful litigation below, under authority of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b), incorporating 29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b).

A member of the active court sua sponte called for a poll of the court to determine whether the court would rehear the case en banc.  Judges Seymour, Ebel, and Lucero voted to grant rehearing en banc.  All other active members of the court voted to deny rehearing en banc.  The petition for rehearing is therefore denied.\\n      JOHN C. PORFILIO, Circuit Judge.\\n    \\n    \\n      1\\n      Because I find no precedence for the publication of an order denying rehearing and rehearing en banc, I have no idea what to label this missive.  Nonetheless, an issue has been made over the denial of rehearing en banc, and I am stirred to state for the record the reason why I have voted to deny.  I hope in so doing I do not create a custom for this court, because there already being enough judicial verbiage in print to confound practioners, I find opprobrious this whole notion of publishing non-precedential matters.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      Lest there be a misapprehension, my vote has absolutely nothing to do with the merits of the case.  Guided by what I believe are the controlling principles of Fed.

R. 36.1, and rendering the decision virtually uncitable, 10th Cir.  R. 36.3, I believe the panel decision presents no question of exceptional importance.  What the panel determined makes no impact upon the jurisprudence of this circuit;  therefore, it has no value except to the parties themselves.  Accordingly, in my opinion the proceeding does not reach the high standard for en banc rehearing required by Rule 35(a).  I have never voted to grant rehearing en banc in such a case, and I find nothing about this one to change my practice.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      LUCERO, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      In an unpublished order, a panel of this court recently decided that a pro se plaintiff\\'s allegations of racial and sexual harassment are insufficient to resist summary judgment under Title VII.  Vigil v. City of Las Cruces, No. 96-2059, 1997 WL 265095 (10th Cir.  May 20, 1997).  Mary Ann Vigil claims that when working as a department clerk typist at the Las Cruces International Airport, her supervisor \"frequently\" referred to Hispanics as \"wetbacks,\" and, in response to complaints that Hispanic customers were overcharged, stated, \"I didn\\'t know that Mexicans had rights.\"   She further claims that this same supervisor offered her pornographic software, left pornographic photographs in her desk, and \"constantly\" requested that she accompany him flying despite her repeated statements that she was not interested in doing so.  Assuming the truth of these contentions, Ms. Vigil has presented an adequate case of a racially and sexually hostile work environment, as defined by the Supreme Court in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 66, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986), and Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993).\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      In ruling against Ms. Vigil\\'s racial harassment claim, the panel relies on Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., 833 F.2d 1406 (10th Cir.1987), which states:\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      It is well established that a working environment dominated by racial slurs constitutes a violation of Title VII.  To establish a racially hostile work environment, however, plaintiffs must prove more than a few isolated incidents of racial enmity.  Casual comments, or accidental or sporadic conversation, will not trigger equitable relief pursuant to the statute.  Instead, there must be a steady barrage of opprobrious racial comment.  Title VII is violated only where the work environment is so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy the emotional and psychological stability of the minority employee.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Id. at 1412-13 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  In light of Meritor and Harris, the panel errs in relying on Hicks.   I have therefore requested the court to reconsider en banc the current status of Hicks in Title VII hostile work environment cases and the application of a corrected standard to Ms. Vigil\\'s racial and sexual harassment claims.1  From the court\\'s decision not to rehear the case en banc, I respectfully dissent.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      In Meritor, the Supreme Court held that Title VII is violated where harassment is \"sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [the victim\\'s] employment and create an abusive working environment.\"  477 U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405 (quotation omitted) (alteration in original).  Subsequently, the Court stressed that this standard does not require a plaintiff to show that the conduct complained of caused \"tangible psychological injury.\"  Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370.   The Harris Court was careful to note that:\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      [t]he appalling conduct alleged in Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments \"so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers,\" merely present some especially egregious examples of harassment.  They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Id. at 22, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 66, 106 S.Ct. at 2404) (further quotation omitted) (emphasis added).  Thus our claim in Hicks that \"Title VII is violated only where the work environment is so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy the emotional and psychological stability of the minority employee,\" 833 F.2d at 1412-13 (quotation omitted), cannot stand.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Moreover, although Tenth Circuit cases subsequent to Harris have repeated the requirement of Hicks that \"there must be a steady barrage of opprobrious racial comment,\" id., for a Title VII claim to lie, see, e.g, Bolden v. PRC Inc., 43 F.3d 545, 551 (10th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 826, 116 S. Ct. 92, 133 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1995), Harris must at a minimum color our interpretation of what constitutes a \"barrage.\"   A \"barrage\" cannot, consistent with Harris, be found to exist only in cases where the psychological well-being of a Title VII plaintiff is tangibly affected.  See Harris, 510 U.S. at 22, 114 S. Ct. at 370 (\"So long as the environment would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, there is no need for it also to be psychologically injurious.\").  If we are to require a \"barrage\" at all, then we must purge the term of its historically-entrenched overtones of psychological injury.2\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      But we should go further and dispense with the requirement of a \"steady barrage\" altogether.  The Supreme Court has made clear that racial or sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII whenever the conduct at issue is \"severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.\"  Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (emphasis added).  If sufficiently severe, harassment is actionable under Title VII--regardless of its pervasiveness or frequency.  See Harris, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. at 371 (determination of objective hostility is made \"by looking at all the circumstances,\" including \"the frequency of the discriminatory conduct [and] its severity,\" but \"no single factor is required.\")  (emphasis added).\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      In line with Harris, other circuits have recognized that Title VII hostile work environment plaintiffs need not prove a pattern, \"steady barrage,\" or other minimum quantum of discriminatory conduct in order to establish actionable harassment.  See Torres v. Pisano, 116 F.3d 625, 631 (2d Cir. 1997) (\"Of course, even a single episode of harassment, if severe enough, can establish a hostile work environment.\");  Davis v. Monsanto Chem.  Co., 858 F.2d 345, 349 (6th Cir.1988) (\"[P]laintiff need not prove that the instances of alleged harassment were related in either time or type.  Rather all that the victim of racial harassment need show is that the alleged conduct constituted an unreasonably abusive or offensive work-related environment or adversely affected the reasonable employee\\'s ability to do his or her job.\");  Rodgers v. Western-Southern Life Ins. Co., 12 F.3d 668, 674 (7th Cir.1993) (\"Within the totality of circumstances, there is neither a threshold \\'magic number\\' of harassing incidents that gives rise, without more, to liability as a matter of law nor a number of incidents below which a plaintiff fails as a matter of law to state a claim.\")  (emphasis added);  Daniels v. Essex Group, Inc., 937 F.2d 1264, 1274 n. 4 (7th Cir.1991) (recognizing that single, isolated incident of harassment can give rise to employer liability for racial harassment under Title VII).3\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      In its continued reliance on Hicks, this court appears to believe that only the most egregious cases will give rise to an actionable claim of a hostile work environment under Title VII.  Such a belief is entirely without foundation.  As the Second Circuit has noted even since I requested an en banc rehearing in this case, Harris stands for a very simple and straightforward proposition:  \"Whenever the harassment is of such quality or quantity that a reasonable employee would find the conditions of her employment altered for the worse, it is actionable under Title VII, so long as the employee subjectively experienced a hostile work environment.\"  Torres, 116 F.3d 625, 633 (citing Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370) (emphasis added).  To prove harassment, employees are held only to a standard of reasonableness.  Id. That standard is designed to protect the individual employee\\'s statutory right to work in an environment free from racial and sexual abuse.  It is not intended to legitimate the discriminatory practices of a majoritarian culture.  See id. at 633 (\"What is, is not always what is right, and reasonable people can take justifiable offense at comments that the vulgar among us, even if they are a majority, would consider acceptable.\");  King v. Hillen, 21 F.3d 1572, 1582 (Fed.Cir.1994) (\"The purpose of Title VII is not to import into the workplace the prejudices of the community, but through law to liberate the workplace from the demeaning influence of discrimination.\");  Ellison v. Brady, 924 F.2d 872, 878 (9th Cir.1991) (harassment should be analyzed from the perspective of the victim else \"[h]arassers could continue to harass merely because a particular discriminatory practice was common\") (citing EEOC Compliance Manual (CCH) &#167; 615, p 3112, C at 3242 (1988) (courts \"should consider the victim\\'s perspective and not stereotyped notions of acceptable behavior.\"));   see also Winsor v. Hinckley Dodge, Inc., 79 F.3d 996, 1001 (10th Cir.1996) (\"Just as we would not sanction an industry term that is facially derogatory to a particular racial or ethnic group, we cannot accept the argument that industry use of an inherently sex-related term neutralizes its detrimental effect on women.\").\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      In affirming summary judgment for the City of Las Cruces, the panel holds that it is per se unreasonable for a Hispanic worker to consider what she describes as her supervisor\\'s \"frequent\" references to \"wetbacks\" as being hostile or abusive.  I am disappointed that the panel reaches that conclusion;  more importantly, I can see no legal or factual basis to support it.  Cf. Rodgers, 12 F.3d at 675 (\"Perhaps no single act can more quickly alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment than the use of an unambiguously racial epithet such as \\'nigger\\' by a supervisor in the presence of his subordinates.\")  (citations omitted);  see also Winsor, 79 F.3d at 1000 (recognizing that sexual epithets are intensely degrading to women);  Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co., 25 F.3d 1459, 1463 (9th Cir.1994) (derogatory use of sexually explicit and offensive terms, such as \"dumb-fucking broad,\" sufficient to establish actionable hostile work environment claim), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1082, 115 S.

McGregor Elec. Indus., Inc., 989 F.2d 959, 964 (8th Cir.1993) (obscene name-calling constitutes harassment based on sex);  Erebia v. Chrysler Plastic Prods.   Corp., 772 F.2d 1250, 1256 (6th Cir.1985) (\"repeated\" use of racial slurs against Mexican-American sufficient to support hostile work environment claim under Title VII standards).\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      The term \"wetback\" is severely degrading.  See Katz v. Dole, 709 F.2d 251, 254 (4th Cir.1983) (degrading epithets \"deriv[e] their power to wound not only from their meaning but also from the disgust and violence they express phonetically\") (quotation omitted).  Accordingly, its use hardly needs to be pervasive for a Hispanic employee to find her work environment hostile and abusive--and reasonably so.  See Rodgers, 12 F.3d at 675-76 (use of term \"nigger\" twice by supervisor, in conjunction with three other racially-motivated statements, sufficient to satisfy \"objective prong of the test for Title VII racial harassment claims.\");   cf. Ellison, 924 F.2d at 878 (\"[T]he required showing of severity or seriousness of the harassing conduct varies inversely with the pervasiveness or frequency of the conduct.\");   EEOC Compliance Manual, &#167; 615. p 3112, C at 3243(CCH) (same);  Bolden, 43 F.3d at 551-52 (\"infrequent\" racial slurs and jokes by coworkers insufficient to defeat summary judgment).  While Ms. Vigil\\'s pro se allegations that the term was used \"frequently\" are understandably not a model of specificity or legal draftsmanship, I cannot see how the panel is able to construe those allegations to mean that the term may have been used so infrequently as to preclude Ms. Vigil\\'s subjective perceptions of a hostile work environment from being objectively reasonable.4  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2551, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) (summary judgment only appropriate where non-movant \"fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [her] case\") (emphasis added).  Her relative lack of evidence as to specific individual incidents of harassment may make a jury less likely to find her work environment objectively hostile, but that does not justify summary judgment for the defendant on grounds that her allegations of \"frequent\" usage are too conclusory.  See Torres, 116 F.3d 625, 630 (\"If a jury were to credit [the] general allegations of constant abuse, ... it could reasonably find pervasive harassment, even in the absence of specific details about each incident.\");  Fernot v. Crafts Inn, Inc., 895 F. Supp. 668, 677 (D.Vt.1995) (\"The fact that the testimony indicated that [the supervisor] was \\'always\\' making sexual remarks and regularly leered [at the plaintiff], rather than giving specific dates, does not negate its role in establishing a work environment of sufficiently pervasive sexual harassment.\");   see also DiLaurenzio v. Atlantic Paratrans, Inc., 926 F. Supp. 310, 314 (E.D.N.Y.1996) (pervasiveness of harassing conduct \"is the sort of issue that is often not susceptible of summary resolution.\").  The bottom line is that appellant\\'s racial harassment claim is far more specific than it is conclusory.  We have the what, the where, the why, and a solid enough idea of the how often.5\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Ms. Vigil\\'s sex-based claim is also actionable.  She alleges she was subjected to constant unwelcome invitations, and exposed to pornographic, sexually explicit pictures, and sexual jokes by her immediate supervisor and other airport workers.  More specifically, she alleges that her supervisor regularly requested that she go flying with him, and that when she first arrived at her job, she found pornography in a manilla folder in her desk drawer.  When asked about the pornography, her supervisor stated that it had belonged to the desk\\'s previous occupant.  Another employee, however, indicated that the supervisor had given it to that previous occupant.  Ms. Vigil also alleges that her supervisor offered her pornographic and \"X-rated\" software.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      \"Sexual harassment is behavior that would not occur but for the sex of the employee....\"  Winsor, 79 F.3d at 1000 (quotation omitted).  From her testimony, it is obvious Ms. Vigil perceived her supervisor\\'s invitations to be of a sexual character.  Given that her would-be host allegedly offered pornographic material to appellant and may have lied about providing such material to a previous female employee, I cannot say her perception was unreasonable.  We should therefore assume for summary judgment purposes that her supervisor\\'s invitations were on account of her sex.  See id. at 1000-01.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      Moreover, I see no basis to conclude that her supervisor\\'s invitations could not amount to an objectively \"intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\"  Hirase-Doi, 61 F.3d at 782 (quotation omitted).  Considering the record as a whole and the totality of circumstances, including the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which they occurred, see Gross v. Burggraf Constr.   Co., 53 F.3d 1531, 1537 (10th Cir.1995), appellant has alleged harassment severe or pervasive enough to constitute an objectively hostile work environment.  Appellant\\'s male supervisor constantly invited her flying despite her frequent disclaimers of interest in flying.  He allegedly offered her pornographic materials and may have lied to her about his provision of similar materials to a previous female employee.  Reasonable minds may differ in analyzing the sum of these facts.  Ultimately, therefore, the question of whether the supervisor\\'s sexual behavior was abusive or merely offensive should also have been left to a jury.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      The test established by the Supreme Court for actionable harassment looks to \"all the circumstances\" of the harassment, including a number of factors that contribute to abusiveness, none of which is required or determinative.  Harris, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. at 371.   As Justice Scalia has recognized, \"objective abusiveness\" is therefore an inherently \"vague\" standard that provides few parameters for juries to decide when legal harm has been suffered.  Harris, 510 U.S. at 24, 114 S.Ct. at 371 (Scalia, J., concurring).  But, as Justice Scalia notes, there is \"no test more faithful to the inherently vague statutory language,\" of Title VII.  Id. at 25, 114 S.Ct. at 372.   Today, this court continues to put forward a standard for actionable harassment that is far more specific:  severely degrading racist epithets must \"barrage\" a plaintiff before she may have recourse to the protections of federal law.  In so doing, we ignore the Supreme Court\\'s faithfulness to the language of Title VII.  Our reliance on Hicks contravenes the spirit and the letter of the Supreme Court\\'s considered jurisprudence on hostile work environment claims.  I respectfully dissent from my colleagues\\' refusal to correct this misplaced reliance.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         The panel does not formally rely on Hicks in affirming summary judgment against Ms. Vigil on her sexual harassment claim.  However, the panel does rely on Lowe v. Angelo\\'s Italian Foods, Inc., 87 F.3d 1170, 1175 (10th Cir.1996), for the proposition that \"[c]asual or isolated manifestations of discriminatory conduct, such as a few sexual comments or slurs, may not support a cause of action.\"   This erroneous conclusion rests squarely on Hicks.   See Lowe, 87 F.3d at 1175 (citing Hicks, 833 F.2d at 1414).   Under the correct standard for actionable hostile work environment claims, as stated in Meritor and Harris, Ms. Vigil\\'s sexual harassment suit withstands summary judgment\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         Harris does require that the victim of actionable harassment \"subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive,\" 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S. Ct. at 370 and to that extent affirms that some minimal psychological component must be alleged for a Title VII hostile work environment claim to lie.  Here the appellant regarded the terms used by her supervisor as \"derogatory\" and amounting to \"discrimination.\"   I R, tabs 5 &amp; 7. Given appellant\\'s pro se status, these allegations should be construed liberally to hold that appellant has put forward facts sufficient to satisfy the subjective requirement of a hostile work environment claim\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Those circuits that continue to insist on a quantitative requirement do so in purported reliance on the Supreme Court\\'s admonitions in Harris and Meritor that \"mere utterance of an ... epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee ... does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII.\"  Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370;  Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S. Ct. at 2405.   See, e.g., Kimzey v. Wal-Mart Stores, 107 F.3d 568, 573 (8th Cir.1996) (citing Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S. Ct. at 2405 for the proposition that \"[m]ore than a few isolated incidents are required.\").  Such cases fail to recognize that some epithets do far more than engender offensive feelings.  As the Supreme Court recognized in Harris, when \"discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult ... is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\\'s employment and create an abusive working environment, Title VII is violated.\"  Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 65, 67, 106 S. Ct. at 2404, 2405) (emphasis added).  Thus, if \"insult\" is \"sufficiently severe,\" Title VII is violated whether or not the insult \"pervades\" the workplace.  The cautionary language of Meritor does no more than point out that the single utterance of a term that engenders offensive feelings cannot substantiate a hostile work environment claim.  That does not mean that severely degrading, racially derogatory insult of the worst kind escapes actionability under Title VII simply because it is used only occasionally\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         Ms. Vigil\\'s allegations do not make clear which Hispanics her supervisor referred to as \"wetbacks,\" and in particular whether these terms were specifically directed at her.  That omission is immaterial.  See Hirase-Doi v. U.S. West Communications, Inc., 61 F.3d 777, 782 (10th Cir.1995) (\"[E]vidence of a general work atmosphere, including evidence of harassment of other [minority members], may be considered in evaluating a claim.\");  Black v. Zaring Homes, Inc., 104 F.3d 822, 826 (6th Cir.1997) (\"[S]ex-based comments need not be directed at a plaintiff in order to constitute conduct violating Title VII.\").  Where a supervisor refers frequently to minority members using gross racial slurs, a fellow minority member working under that supervisor and directly exposed to his abuse would be entirely reasonable were he or she to take such comments \"personally.\"   I note in this context that we have already held that \"even a woman who was never herself the object of sexual harassment might have a Title VII claim if she were forced to work in an atmosphere where such harassment was pervasive.\"  Daemi v. Church\\'s Fried Chicken, Inc., 931 F.2d 1379, 1385 (10th Cir.1991);  see also Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238-39 (5th Cir.1971) (racially discriminatory treatment of patients may give rise to Title VII claim by worker).  The Supreme Court has held that where \"the workplace is permeated with discriminatory ... insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to ... create an abusive working environment, Title VII is violated.\"  Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (emphasis added) (internal quotations and citations omitted)\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         At the very least, if courts are to grant summary judgment against pro se litigants on the basis of such nuanced formalisms, they should take care to inform non-movants of their evidentiary burden under Fed.  R. Civ. Proc. 56(e).  See Timms v. Frank, 953 F.2d 281, 285 (7th Cir.1992) (all pro se litigants entitled to notice of R. 56 evidentiary requirements);  cf.  Jaxon v. Circle K. Corp., 773 F.2d 1138, 1140 (10th Cir.1985) (allowing pro se litigant \"a meaningful opportunity to remedy the obvious defects in ... summary judgment materials,\" and instructing district courts to \"take care to insure that pro se litigants are provided with proper notice regarding the complex procedural issues involved in summary judgment proceedings\").  All the indications are that Ms. Vigil failed to translate widely-used and commonly-understood terms like \"frequently\" and \"constantly\" into precise, specific numerical equivalents because she had no knowledge of any evidentiary need to do so\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 744144}, {'author_str': 'Porfilio', 'per_curiam': False, 'type': '020lead', 'page_count': None, 'download_url': None, 'author_id': None, 'opinion_text': '\\nORDER\\nThe petition for rehearing is denied by the panel of judges who decided the case on the ground that the petition was not timely filed.

Vigil v. City of Las Cruces, No. 96-2059, 1997 WL 265095 (10th Cir. May 20, 1997). Mary Ann Vigil claims that when working as a department clerk typist at the Las Cruces International Airport, her supervisor \u201cfrequently\u201d referred to Hispanies as \u201cwetbacks,\u201d and, in response to complaints that Hispanic customers were overcharged, stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that Mexicans had rights.\u201d She further claims that this same *872supervisor offered her pornographic software, left pornographic photographs in her desk, and \u201cconstantly\u201d requested that she accompany him flying despite her repeated statements that she was not interested in doing so. Assuming the truth of these contentions, Ms. Vigil has presented an adequate case of a racially and sexually hostile work environment, as defined by the Supreme Court in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 66, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986), and Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993).\\nIn ruling against Ms. Vigil\u2019s racial harassment claim, the panel relies on Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., 833 F.2d 1406 (10th Cir.1987), which states:\\nIt is well established that a working environment dominated by racial slurs constitutes a violation of Title VII. To establish a racially hostile work environment, however, plaintiffs must prove more than a few isolated incidents of racial enmity. Casual comments, or accidental or sporadic conversation, will not trigger equitable relief pursuant to the statute. Instead, there must be a steady barrage of opprobrious racial comment. Title VII is violated only where the work environment is so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy the emotional and psychological stability of the minority employee.\\nId. at 1412-13 (internal quotations and citations omitted). In light of Meritor and Harris, the panel errs in relying on Hicks. I have therefore requested the court to reconsider en banc the current status of Hicks in Title VII hostile work environment cases and the application of a corrected standard to Ms. Vigil\u2019s racial and sexual harassment claims.1 From the court\u2019s decision not to rehear the case en banc, I respectfully dissent.\\nIn Meritor, the Supreme Court held that Title VII is violated where harassment is \u201csufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [the victim\u2019s] employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405 (quotation omitted) (alteration in original). Subsequently, the Court stressed that this standard does not require a plaintiff to show that the conduct complained of caused \u201ctangible psychological injury.\u201d Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370. The Harris Court was careful to note that:\\n[t]he appalling conduct alleged in Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments \u201cso heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers,\u201d merely present some especially egregious examples of harassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable.\\nId. at 22, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 66, 106 S.Ct. at 2404) (further quotation omitted) (emphasis added). Thus our claim in Hicks that \u201cTitle VII is violated only where the work environment is so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy the emotional and psychological stability of the minority employee,\u201d 833 F.2d at 1412-13 (quotation omitted), cannot stand.\\nMoreover, although Tenth Circuit cases subsequent to Harris have repeated the requirement of Hicks that \u201cthere must be a steady barrage of opprobrious racial comment,\u201d id., for a Title VII claim to lie, see, e.g, Bolden v. PRC Inc., 43 F.3d 545, 551 (10th Cir.1994), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 92, 133 L.Ed.2d 48 (1995), Harris must at a minimum color our interpretation of what constitutes a \u201cbarrage.\u201d A \u201cbarrage\u201d cannot, consistent with Harris, be found to exist only in cases where the psychological well-being of a Title VII plaintiff is tangibly affected. See Harris, 510 U.S. at 22, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (\u201cSo long as the environment would reasonably be perceived, and is *873pe\u2019ceived, as hostile or abusive, there is no need for it also to be psychologically injurious.\u201d). If we are to require a \u201cbarrage\u201d at all, then we must purge the term of its historically-entrenched overtones of psychological injury.2\\nBut we should go further and dispense with the requirement of a \u201csteady barrage\u201d altogether. The Supreme Court has made clear that racial or sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII whenever the conduct at issue is \u201csevere or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment \u2014 an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.\u201d Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (emphasis added). If sufficiently severe, harassment is actionable under Title VII\u2014 regardless of its pervasiveness or frequency. See Harris, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. at 371 (determination of objective hostility is made \u201cby looking at all the circumstances,\u201d including \u201cthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct [and] its severity,\u201d but \u201cno single factor is required.\u201d) (emphasis added).\\nIn line with Harris, other circuits have recognized that Title VII hostile work environment plaintiffs need not prove a pattern, \u201csteady barrage,\u201d or other minimum quantum of discriminatory conduct in order to establish actionable harassment. See Torres v. Pisano, 116 F.3d 625, 631 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cOf course, even a single episode of harassment, if severe enough, can establish a hostile work environment.\u201d); Davis v. Monsanto Chem. Co., 858 F.2d 345, 349 (6th Cir.1988) (\u201c[P]laintiff need not prove that the instances of alleged harassment were related in either time or type. Rather all that the victim of racial harassment need show is that the alleged conduct constituted an unreasonably abusive or offensive work-related environment or adversely affected the reasonable employee\u2019s ability to do his or her job.\u201d); Rodgers v. Western-Southern Life Ins. Co., 12 F.3d 668, 674 (7th Cir.1993) (\u201cWithin the totality of circumstances, there is neither a threshold \u2018magic number\u2019 of harassing incidents that gives rise, without more, to liability as a matter of law nor a number of incidents below which a plaintiff fails as a matter of law to state a claim.\u201d) (emphasis added); Daniels v. Essex Group, Inc., 937 F.2d 1264, 1274 n. 4 (7th Cir.1991) (recognizing that single, isolated incident of harassment can give rise to employer liability for racial harassment under Title VII).3\\nIn its continued reliance on Hicks, this court appears to believe that only the most egregious eases will give rise to an actionable claim of a hostile work environment under Title VII. Such a belief is entirely without foundation. As the Second Circuit has noted even since I requested an en banc rehearing in this case, Harris stands for a very simple *874and straightforward proposition: \u201cWhenever the harassment is of such quality or quantity that a reasonable employee would find the conditions of her employment altered for the worse, it is actionable under Title VII, so long as the employee subjectively experienced a hostile work environment.\u201d Torres, 116 F.3d 625, 633 (citing Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370) (emphasis added). To prove harassment, employees are held only to a standard of reasonableness. Id. That standard is designed to protect the individual employee\u2019s statutory right to work in an environment free from racial and sexual abuse. It is not intended to legitimate the discriminatory practices of a majoritarian culture. See id. at 633 (\u201cWhat is, is not always what is right, and reasonable people can take justifiable offense at comments that the vulgar among us, even if they are a majority, would consider acceptable.\u201d); King v. Hillen, 21 F.3d 1572, 1582 (Fed.Cir.1994) (\u201cThe purpose of Title VII is not to import into the workplace the prejudices of the community, but through law to liberate the workplace from the demeaning influence of discrimination.\u201d); Ellison v. Brady, 924 F.2d 872, 878 (9th Cir.1991) (harassment should be analyzed from the perspective of the victim else \u201c[hjarassers could continue to harass merely because a particular discriminatory practice was common\u201d) (citing EEOC Compliance Manual (CCH) \u00a7 615, \u00b63112, C at 3242 (1988) (courts \u201cshould consider the victim\u2019s perspective and not stereotyped notions of acceptable behavior.\u201d)); see also Winsor v. Hinckley Dodge, Inc., 79 F.3d 996, 1001 (10th Cir.1996) (\u201cJust as we would not sanction an industry term that is facially derogatory to a particular racial or ethnic group, we cannot accept the argument that industry use of an inherently sex-related term neutralizes its detrimental effect on women.\u201d).\\nIn affirming summary judgment for the City of Las Cruces, the panel holds that it is per se unreasonable for a Hispanic worker to consider what she describes as her supervisor\u2019s \u201cfrequent\u201d references to \u201cwetbacks\u201d as being hostile or abusive. I am disappointed that the panel reaches that conclusion; more importantly, I can see no legal or factual basis to support it. Cf. Rodgers, 12 F.3d at 675 (\u201cPerhaps no single act can more quickly alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment than the use of an unambiguously racial epithet such as \u2018nigger\u2019 by a supervisor in the presence of his subordinates.\u201d) (citations omitted); see also Winsor, 79 F.3d at 1000 (recognizing that sexual epithets are intensely degrading to women); Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co., 25 F.3d 1459, 1463 (9th Cir.1994) (derogatory use of sexually explicit and offensive terms, such as \u201cdumb-fucking broad,\u201d sufficient to establish actionable hostile work environment claim), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1082, 115 S.Ct. 733, 130 L.Ed.2d 636 (1995); id. at 1464 (use of term \u201cUFOs \u2014 ugly fucking orientals\u201d to refer to Asians sufficient to state actionable racial harassment claim); Boutros v. Canton Regional Transit Auth., 997 F.2d 198, 202-204 (6th Cir.1993) (allegations that supervisors repeatedly referred to Syrian-born bus driver as \u201ccamel jockey,\u201d \u201ccamel rider,\u201d \u201crug peddler,\u201d \u201cheeb,\u201d and instructed him to depart from standard bus routes, then disciplined him for doing so, sufficient to state Title VII hostile work environment claim); Burns v. McGregor Elec. Indus., Inc., 989 F.2d 959, 964 (8th Cir.1993) (obscene name-calling constitutes harassment based on sex); Erebia v. Chrysler Plastic Prods. Corp., 772 F.2d 1250, 1256 (6th Cir.1985) (\u201crepeated\u201d use of racial slurs against Mexiean-American sufficient to support hostile work environment claim under Title VII standards).\\nThe term \u201cwetback\u201d is severely degrading. See Katz v. Dole, 709 F.2d 251, 254 (4th Cir.1983) (degrading epithets \u201cderiv[e] then-power to wound not only from their meaning but also from the disgust and violence they express phonetically\u201d) (quotation omitted). Accordingly, its use hardly needs to be pervasive for a Hispanic employee to find her work environment hostile and abusive \u2014 and reasonably so. See Rodgers, 12 F.3d at 675-76 (use of term \u201cnigger\u201d twice by supervisor, in conjunction with three other racially-motivated statements, sufficient to satisfy \u201cobjective prong of the test for Title VII racial harassment claims.\u201d); cf. Ellison, 924 F.2d at 878 (\u201c[T]he required showing of severity or seriousness of the harassing conduct varies inversely with the pervasiveness or fre*875quency of the conduct.\u201d); EEOC Compliance Manual, \u00a7 615. \u00b63112, C at 3243(CCH) (same); Bolden, 43 F.3d at 551-52 (\u201cinfrequent\u201d racial slurs and jokes by coworkers insufficient to defeat summary judgment). While Ms. Vigil\u2019s pro se allegations that the term was used \u201cfrequently\u201d are understandably not a model of specificity or legal draftsmanship, I cannot see how the panel is able to construe those allegations to mean that the term may have been used so infrequently as to preclude Ms. Vigil\u2019s subjective perceptions of a hostile work environment from being objectively reasonable.4 See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2551, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (summary judgment only appropriate where non-movant \u201cfails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [her] case\u201d) (emphasis added). Her relative lack of evidence as to specific individual incidents of harassment may make a jury less likely to find her work environment objectively hostile, but that does not justify summary judgment for the defendant on grounds that her allegations of \u201cfrequent\u201d usage are too conclusory. See Torres, 116 F.3d 625, 630 (\u201cIf a jury were to credit [the] general allegations of constant abuse, ... it\\ncould reasonably find pervasive harassment, even in the absence of specific details about each incident.\u201d); Femot v. Crafts Inn, Inc., 895 F.Supp. 668, 677 (D.Vt.1995) (\u201cThe fact that the testimony indicated that [the supervisor] was \u2018always\u2019 making sexual remarks and regularly leered [at the plaintiff], rather than giving specific dates, does not negate its role in establishing a work environment of sufficiently pervasive sexual harassment.\u201d); see also DiLaurenzio v. Atlantic Paratrans, Inc., 926 F.Supp. 310, 314 (E.D.N.Y.1996) (pervasiveness of harassing conduct \u201cis the sort of issue that is often not susceptible of summary resolution.\u201d). The bottom line is that appellant\u2019s racial harassment claim is far more specific than it is conclusory. We have the what, the where, the why, and a solid enough idea of the how often.5\\nMs. Vigil\u2019s sex-based claim is also actionable. She alleges she was subjected to constant unwelcome invitations, and exposed to pornographic, sexually explicit pictures, and sexual jokes by her immediate supervisor and other airport workers. More specifically, she alleges that her supervisor regularly requested that she go flying with him, and that when she first arrived at her job, she found pornography in a manilla folder in her *876desk drawer. When asked about the pornography, her supervisor stated that it had belonged to the desk\u2019s previous occupant. Another employee, however, indicated that the supervisor had given it to that previous occupant. Ms. Vigil also alleges that her supervisor offered her pornographic and \u201cX-rated\u201d software.\\n\u201cSexual harassment is behavior that would not occur but for the sex of the employee____\u201d Winsor, 79 F.3d at 1000 (quotation omitted). From her testimony, it is obvious Ms. Vigil perceived her supervisor\u2019s invitations to be of a sexual character. Given that her would-be host allegedly offered pornographic material to appellant and may have lied about providing such material to a previous female employee, I cannot say her perception was unreasonable. We should therefore assume for summary judgment purposes that her supervisor\u2019s invitations were on account of her sex. See id. at 1000-01.\\nMoreover, I see no basis to conclude that her supervisor\u2019s invitations could not amount to an objectively \u201cintimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\u201d Hirase-Doi, 61 F.3d at 782 (quotation omitted). Considering the record as a whole and the totality of circumstances, including the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which they occurred, see Gross v. Burggraf Constr. Co., 53 F.3d 1531, 1537 (10th Cir.1995), appellant has alleged harassment severe or pervasive enough to constitute an objectively hostile work environment. Appellant\u2019s male supervisor constantly invited her flying despite her frequent disclaimers of interest in flying. He allegedly offered her pornographic materials and may have lied to her about his provision of similar materials to a previous female employee. Reasonable minds may differ in analyzing the sum of these facts. Ultimately, therefore, the question of whether the supervisor\u2019s sexual behavior was abusive or merely offensive should also have been left to a jury.\\nThe test established by the Supreme Court for actionable harassment looks to \u201call the circumstances\u201d of the harassment, including a number of factors that contribute to abusiveness, none of which is required or determinative. Harris, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. at 371. As Justice Scalia has recognized, \u201cobjective abusiveness\u201d is therefore an inherently \u201cvague\u201d standard that provides few parameters for juries to decide when legal harm has been suffered. Harris, 510 U.S. at 24, 114 S.Ct. at 371 (Scalia, J., concurring). But, as Justice Scalia notes, there is \u201cno test more faithful to the inherently vague statutory language,\u201d of Title VII. Id. at 25, 114 S.Ct. at 372. Today, this court continues to put forward a standard for actionable harassment that is far more specific: severely degrading racist epithets must \u201cbarrage\u201d a plaintiff before she may have recourse to the protections of federal law. In so doing, we ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s faithfulness to the language of Title VII. Our reliance on Hicks contravenes the spirit and the letter of the Supreme Court\u2019s considered jurisprudence on hostile work environment claims. I respectfully dissent from my colleagues\u2019 refusal to correct this misplaced reliance.\\n\\n. The panel does not formally rely on Hicks in affirming summary judgment against Ms. Vigil on her sexual harassment claim. However, the panel does rely on Lowe v. Angelo\\'s Italian Foods, Inc., 87 F.3d 1170, 1175 (10th Cir.1996), for the proposition that \u201c[c]asual or isolated manifestations of discriminatory conduct, such as a few sexual comments or slurs, may not support a cause of action.\u201d This erroneous conclusion rests squarely on Hicks. See Lowe, 87 F.3d at 1175 (citing Hicks, 833 F.2d at 1414). Under the correct standard for actionable hostile work environment claims, as stated in Meritor and Harris, Ms. Vigil\\'s sexual harassment suit withstands summary judgment.\\n\\n\\n. Harris does require that the victim of actionable harassment \"subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive,\u201d 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370 and to that extent affirms that some minimal psychological component must be alleged for a Title VII hostile work environment claim to lie. Here the appellant regarded the terms used by her supervisor as \"derogatory\u201d and amounting to \"discrimination.\u201d I R, tabs 5 &amp; 7. Given appellant\u2019s pro se status, these allegations should be construed liberally to hold that appellant has put forward facts sufficient to satisfy the subjective requirement of a hostile work environment claim.\\n\\n\\n. Those circuits that continue to insist on a quantitative requirement do so in purported reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s admonitions in Harris and Meritor that \"mere utterance of an ... epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee ... does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII.\u201d Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370; Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405. See, e.g., Kimzey v. Wal-Mart Stores, 107 F.3d 568, 573 (8th Cir.1996) (citing Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405 for the proposition that \"[m]ore than a few isolated incidents are required.\u201d). Such cases fail to recognize that some epithets do far more than engender offensive feelings. As the Supreme Court recognized in Harris, when \"discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult ... is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\\'s employment and create an abusive working environment, Title VII is violated.\u201d Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 65, 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2404, 2405) (emphasis added). Thus, if \"insult\u201d is \u201csufficiently severe,\u201d Title VII is violated whether or not the insult \"pervades\" the workplace. The cautionary language of Meritor does no more than point out that the single utterance of a term that engenders offensive feelings cannot substantiate a hostile work environment claim. That does not mean that severely degrading, racially derogatory insult of the worst kind escapes actionability under Title VII simply because it is used only occasionally.\\n\\n\\n. Ms. Vigil\u2019s allegations do not make clear which Hispanics her supervisor referred to as \"wetbacks,\u201d and in particular whether these terms were specifically directed at her. That omission is immaterial. See Hirase-Doi v. U.S. West Communications, Inc., 61 F.3d 777, 782 (10th Cir.1995) (\u201d[E]vidence of a general work atmosphere, including evidence of harassment of other [minority members], may be considered in evaluating a claim.\u201d); Black v. Zaring Homes, Inc., 104 F.3d 822, 826 (6th Cir.1997) (\u201d[S]ex-based comments need not be directed at a plaintiff in order to constitute conduct violating Title VII.\u201d). Where a supervisor refers frequently to minority members using gross racial slurs, a fellow minority member working under that supervisor and directly exposed to his abuse would be entirely reasonable were he or she to take such comments \"personally.\u201d I note in this context that we have already held that \"even a woman who was never herself the object of sexual harassment might have a Title VII claim if she were forced to work in an atmosphere where such harassment was pervasive.\u201d Daemi v. Church\\'s Fried Chicken, Inc., 931 F.2d 1379, 1385 (10th Cir.1991); see also Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238-39 (5th Cir.1971) (racially discriminatory treatment of patients may give rise to Title VII claim by worker). The Supreme Court has held that where \"the workplace is permeated with discriminatory ... insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to ... create an abusive working environment, Title VII is violated.\u201d Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (emphasis added) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\\n\\n\\n. At the very least, if courts are to grant summary judgment against pro se litigants on the basis of such nuanced formalisms, they should take care to inform non-movants of their evidentiary burden under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(e). See Timms v. Frank, 953 F.2d 281, 285 (7th Cir.1992) (all pro se litigants entitled to notice of R. 56 evidentiary requirements); cf. Jaxon v. Circle K. Corp., 773 F.2d 1138, 1140 (10th Cir.1985) (allowing pro se litigant \u201ca meaningful opportunity to remedy the obvious defects in ... summary judgment materials,\u201d and instructing district courts to \"take care to insure that pro se litigants are provided with proper notice regarding the complex procedural issues involved in summary judgment proceedings\u201d). All the indications are that Ms. Vigil failed to translate widely-used and commonly-understood terms like \"frequently\u201d and \"constantly\u201d into precise, specific numerical equivalents because she had no knowledge of any evidentiary need to do so.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 9490502}]"},{"id":160850,"date_filed":"2001-03-13","judges":"Baldock, Lucero, Politz","case_name_full":"Lorraine \u201cJade\u201d McKENZIE, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.

The United States District Court for the District of Wyoming granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, and plaintiff appealed. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, we conclude McKenzie made out a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA and therefore reverse.\\n    \\n    I.\\n    \\n      2\\n      McKenzie worked as a deputy sheriff with the Natrona County Sheriff\\'s Office in Casper, Wyoming for ten years. In her decade of service, she reached the rank of sergeant within the organization, performing the duties of shift supervisor, and never had a negative performance evaluation. Beginning in early 1996, McKenzie suffered from a variety of psychological afflictions, including post-traumatic stress disorder related to childhood sexual abuse by her father.1 As her condition worsened, she began to miss work frequently. Then, on August 15, 1996, McKenzie fired six rounds from her revolver into the ground at her father\\'s grave; the next day, Sheriff David Dovala placed her on administrative leave. In the weeks that followed McKenzie suffered serious self-inflicted wounds and drug overdoses requiring several hospital visits. After being told that her leave pay was exhausted, McKenzie resigned voluntarily in October 1996 to seek psychological care.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      In late November of the same year, after a course of medication and therapy, McKenzie was released by her supervising physician, Dr. Arlene Viray. After Dr. Viray sent the Sheriff a letter stating McKenzie\\'s condition had improved sufficiently that she could return to work, McKenzie immediately sought re-employment at the Sheriff\\'s Office and was assured that her application would be considered if openings became available. Despite her ten years of experience and her fine record as a patrol officer, McKenzie\\'s application for employment was rejected at all the agencies to which she applied throughout Wyoming and Nevada. Unable to find work in law enforcement anywhere in the area, she returned to the Sheriff\\'s Office in October 1997 and asked to be considered not only for a position as a patrol officer, but also for any job in the department. Dovala told McKenzie that he was unwilling to consider her application and admitted that the Office was reluctant to hire her because of \"liability\" concerns and fear of public uneasiness related to her past illness. (Appellant\\'s App. at 187.) According to Dovala, members of his staff had told him that \"based upon what they knew about what had happened in the previous year,\" McKenzie \"would be better off in some other field.\" (Id. at 97.)\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Dovala admitted to McKenzie that he had passed over her application when positions became available in the department between November 1996 and October 1997. He acknowledged that he eliminated McKenzie from consideration without ordering a standard psychological evaluation as provided for in Wyoming\\'s Peace Officer Standards and Training (\"POST\") law, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#167; 9-1-704(b)(vii). McKenzie later learned that shortly after her resignation, Undersheriff Mark Benton2 contacted the POST Commission to request that it revoke her certification as a peace officer.3\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      In this suit alleging discrimination prohibited by the ADA, McKenzie claims that Dovala refused to rehire her because he \"regarded\" her as disabled under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(C) or because of her \"record\" of disability under &#167; 12102(2)(B).4 Concluding that McKenzie had not produced sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find she was \"disabled\" under either of those provisions, the district court granted defendant\\'s motion for summary judgment. McKenzie v. Dovala, No. 98-CV-289-D, slip order at 1 (D. Wyo. Aug. 16, 1999).\\n    \\n    II.\\n    \\n      6\\n      \"We review the district court\\'s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standard used by the district court.\" Simms v.

Summary judgment is appropriate only \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The non-movant is given \"wide berth to prove a factual controversy exists.\" Jeffries v. Kansas, 147 F.3d 1220, 1228 (10th Cir. 1998) (quoting Ulissey v. Shvartsman, 61 F.3d 805, 808 (10th Cir. 1995)).\\n    \\n    III.\\n    \\n      7\\n      The ADA provides that no covered employer \"shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to . . . the hiring . . . of employees.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a).5 A \"qualified individual with a disability\" is \"an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\" Id. &#167; 12111(8). To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show \"(1) that [s]he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) that [s]he is qualified-with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) that [s]he was discriminated against because of [her] disability.\" Aldrich v. Boeing Co., 146 F.3d 1265, 1269 (10th Cir. 1998) (internal quotation omitted); see also MacDonald v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 94 F.3d 1437, 1443 (10th Cir. 1996). The district court granted summary judgment for the defendant because it concluded McKenzie could not show she was \"disabled\" so as to satisfy the first prong of the test. McKenzie v. Dovala, No. 98-CV-289, tr. oral ruling at 10 (D. Wyo. Aug. 16, 1999).\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      A \"disability\" is defined by the ADA as: \"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2); see also Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 478 (1999). The ADA\\'s implementing regulations, promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), clarify what constitutes an \"impairment that substantially limits . . . major life activities\" under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(A). Those regulations provide that \"[w]ith respect to the major life activity of working . . . [t]he term substantially limits means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(i).\\n    \\n    A. Disability\\n    \\n      9\\n      The district court concluded there was no genuine issue for trial as to whether McKenzie has a \"disability\" as defined in the ADA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2). McKenzie does not allege she had an actual limiting impairment at the time she sought re-employment. To the contrary, she testified that she was healthy and had obtained permission to resume work. Instead, McKenzie contends she suffered discrimination because she was \"regarded as\" disabled or, alternatively, because of a \"record of\" disability. Id. &#167; 12102(2)(C), (B).\\n    \\n    1.\\n    \\n      10\\n      McKenzie argues that she submitted evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant \"regarded\" her as disabled. See id. &#167; 12102(2)(C). Under this theory of disability, she sought to establish that she \"[h]as none of the impairments defined in . . . this section but is treated by a covered entity as having a substantially limiting impairment,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(l)(3), arguing on summary judgment that she was \"treated\" by the Sheriff\\'s Office as significantly restricted in her ability to perform the class of jobs under the broad heading of law enforcement.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      The district court had before it abundant evidence supporting McKenzie\\'s claim that she was regarded as disabled. Soon after McKenzie\\'s resignation, Benton sought to have her decertified by the POST Commission because, as he explained, he lacked \"trust\" and \"confidence\" in her and \"didn\\'t feel that [she] should be a law enforcement officer any longer.\" (Appellant\\'s App. at 115.) Because certification as a peace officer requires that an individual \"[b]e free of any physical, emotional or mental conditions which might adversely affect [her] performance of duty,\" Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#167; 9-1-704(b)(vii), a reasonable jury could infer from Benton\\'s seeking decertification that Benton believed McKenzie had an \"emotional or mental condition[]\" that impaired her performance as a peace officer.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      The testimony of Dovala and Benton suggests that at the time of McKenzie\\'s reapplication, defendant treated her as substantially limited in her ability to work in law enforcement due to the psychological problems she had suffered in 1996. Dovala testified that when he met with McKenzie in 1997,\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      I had concerns for her mainly, as a police officer, we often have to testify in court. And what generally happens, or happens frequently, is the officer is attacked. And I thought that if she had to do something, this might be brought up in court about what had happened to her in the past. And I was quite concerned that if she had to use violence, for sure, that would be brought up in court by the opposing side. And I thought she would suffer and so would the whole county.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      (Appellant\\'s App. at 97.) The following morning, the Sheriff\\'s staff concluded at a meeting that McKenzie \"would be better off in some other field.\" (Id.) Despite Dovala\\'s admission that he \"was worried about liability,\" he did not order a routine psychological or psychiatric examination to determine whether McKenzie was qualified to be a peace officer under Wyoming law. (Id. at 99.)\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      Benton, too, testified that at the time of McKenzie\\'s 1997 application he was concerned about her history of \"problems,\" as well as the possibility that fellow officers and the public would not \"trust\" her, and concluded that \"it was [not] in her best interest or the best interest of the office for her to regain her position in law enforcement.\" (Id. at 111, 110.) He acknowledged that McKenzie was eliminated from consideration without an evaluation because of her history of psychological problems, admitting \"she didn\\'t make it to that step.\" (Id. at 110.) Benton also testified that although he was aware McKenzie had been authorized by Dr. Viray to return to work, he \"didn\\'t care for the concept\" of her return. (Id. at 108.)\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      According to the EEOC\\'s interpretive guidelines, if an individual can show that a potential employer refused to hire her based on \"myth, fear, or stereotype,\" including concerns regarding safety, insurance, liability, and acceptance by co-workers and the public, the individual will satisfy the \"regarded as\" component of the definition of disability. 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. &#167; 1630.2(l). Dovala and Benton admitted that their concerns included safety, liability, and public acceptance. The fact that defendant rejected McKenzie\\'s application without submitting her for a standard psychological or psychiatric assessment as provided for by state law is further evidence that those concerns were based on \"myths, fears, and stereotype\" rather than on an individualized assessment of her qualifications.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      While conceding defendant \"may have considered plaintiff substantially limited in her ability to work as a deputy sheriff,\" the district court ruled that McKenzie failed to establish that she was regarded as unable to perform a \"class of jobs\" or a \"broad range of jobs in various classes\" as compared to others with comparable training, skills and abilities. McKenzie v. Dovala, No. 98-CV-289, tr. oral ruling at 8-9. \"[T]o be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working, one must be regarded as precluded from more than a particular job.\" Murphy v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 527 U.S. 516, 523 (1999); see also Bowen v. Income Producing Mgmt. of Okla., Inc., 202 F.3d 1282, 1287 (10th Cir. 2000).\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Citing that rule, defendant argues that McKenzie has not shown a substantially limiting impairment under the ADA because after her resignation from the Sheriff\\'s Office she worked in several different occupations, including caretaker, store clerk, and resident counselor. Contrary to this assertion, McKenzie\\'s employment in the wake of her illness is beside the point in two respects. First, her claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(C) is not that she currently has an impairment limiting her ability to work, but that the Sheriff\\'s refusal to consider her application was based on his mistaken perception that she continues to suffer from such an impairment. Second, none of the positions in which McKenzie was employed during the cited period is part of the \"class\" of law enforcement jobs, her prior and preferred field. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(i).\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      The evidence McKenzie submitted shows a factual controversy as to whether defendant viewed McKenzie as limited in her ability to work in the class of jobs comprising law enforcement. Dovala\\'s refusal to consider employing her in a less sensitive post within the Office, such as in the civil division responsible for serving papers and subpoenas, the records division, the administrative division, or the jail division, suggests that he regarded her as substantially limited in her ability to work in an entire class of jobs, not merely in the particular job of patrol officer. Additionally, by seeking to have McKenzie decertified as a \"peace officer\" because he \"didn\\'t feel that [she] should be a law enforcement officer any longer,\" defendant effectively sought to bar her from taking a job as a campus police officer, an investigator for hunting and fishing outfitters, an inspector of livestock, a park superintendent or assistant park superintendent, a park ranger, or any other post that in Wyoming falls within the definition of \"peace officer.\" Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#167; 7-2-101(iv). Significantly, Dovala also testified that his staff rejected McKenzie\\'s request to reapply because \"[t]hey thought that she would be better off in some other field.\" (Appellant\\'s App. at 97.) These statements constitute persuasive evidence that Dovala regarded McKenzie as unable to work in a class of jobs because of a psychological impairment.6\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      By refusing to consider her for a job in her former workplace despite ten years of successful service, the Sheriff treated her as significantly restricted \"as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(i). As Dovala and Benton acknowledged in their respective depositions, it is undisputed that someone with McKenzie\\'s training, skills, and abilities, but without a psychological disability, could have been hired as a patrol officer. Viewing the factual record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we see a genuine issue for trial as to whether the Sheriff regarded McKenzie as disabled under the ADA.\\n    \\n    2.\\n    \\n      21\\n      Alternatively, McKenzie argues the defendant refused to consider her application on the basis of a \"record\" of disability. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(B). A record of disability is a history of impairment that substantially limited a major life activity of a plaintiff. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(k); see also Sorensen v. Univ. of Utah Hosp., 194 F.3d 1084, 1086-87 (10th Cir. 1999). To satisfy this definition, McKenzie therefore must establish that at some point her impairment actually did substantially limit her ability to work. Noting \"[i]t is dispositive that any arguable record of impairment related exclusively to her position of deputy sheriff,\" the district court concluded there was insufficient evidence to show that McKenzie ever was \"significantly restricted\" in either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes. McKenzie v. Dovala, No. 98-CV-289, tr. oral ruling at 7-8.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      In determining whether an impairment is substantially limiting such that it may support a record of disability under the ADA, the following factors are considered: \"(i) [t]he nature and severity of the impairment; (ii) [t]he duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (iii) [t]he permanent or long term impact\" of the impairment. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(2). McKenzie\\'s record of absence from work on administrative leave, along with her physicians\\' reports, tends to show that her ability to work was substantially limited by her illness. Her complete inability to work prior to her resignation was due in part to at least one hospital admission, suggesting that the nature and severity of her impairment were grave. Physicians\\' reports indicate that McKenzie suffered from psychiatric problems during the year prior to her resignation. At least as early as April 1996, she missed work because of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The duration of her illness, which kept her from working throughout much of the summer and autumn of 1996, also indicates a record of impairment. Although the permanent or long-term impact of McKenzie\\'s illness would not tend to support a finding of disability, inasmuch as she has been released to return to work, the evidence as a whole could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that she had a record of a disability for purposes of the ADA.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      When Dovala placed McKenzie on administrative leave, he told her that she would not be reinstated without \"a complete psychological evaluation.\" (Appellant\\'s App. at 49.) His subsequent failure to order a psychological assessment before turning down McKenzie\\'s application suggests that his decision was based on his knowledge of her previous impairment and not on any current inability to perform the job\\'s essential functions. This lack of an employer evaluation contrasts with McKenzie\\'s own physician\\'s assessment that \"she is ready to return to work\" and her psychotherapist\\'s statement that she is \"qualified to perform the duties of any law enforcement position for which she is technically qualified at the time she was discharged from treatment.\" (Appellant\\'s App. at 145, 160.) Dovala even admitted in his deposition that the staff members\\' belief that McKenzie should no longer work in law enforcement was \"based upon what they knew about what had happened the previous year.\" (Id. at 97.) That evidence suffices to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Sheriff relied on McKenzie\\'s history of psychiatric illness when he rejected her application.\\n    \\n    B. Qualification\\n    \\n      24\\n      While the district court\\'s ruling did not address the second prong of a prima facie case under the ADA, which requires a showing that the plaintiff is a qualified individual, the defendant argues that McKenzie did not establish she could perform the essential functions of the job she sought. 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12112(a), 12111(8). Contrary to that assertion, McKenzie produced unrebutted evidence that she was qualified for a position within the Sheriff\\'s Office. She submitted the following exchange from Dovala\\'s deposition:\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      Q: [E]xcluding what you knew about Lorraine [McKenzie] relative to the events that occurred in 1996 . . . she was otherwise qualified for the position as a sheriff\\'s officer, wasn\\'t she?\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      A: Excluding the events, yes, sir.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      (Appellant\\'s App. at 98.) In Benton\\'s deposition, he agreed:\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      Q. And excluding her history or her record of her psychological therapy, the events at the cemetery and on the mountain, was she-would she have been otherwise qualified for the position? . . .\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      A: Yes.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      (Id. at 110.) Dovala also acknowledged that during McKenzie\\'s tenure, she had become a sergeant, \"probably the most ranking officer in the sheriff\\'s office\" according to his testimony. (Id. at 94.)\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      Nonetheless, defendant argues that because Dr. Viray\\'s letter did not articulate the specific tasks McKenzie was able or unable to perform at the time of her release in November 1996, the letter can not support a finding that she was qualified to work in the Sheriff\\'s Office. That conclusion would follow only if we were to view the evidence in the light least favorable to the non-moving party, and that is not our task on review of summary judgment. See Simms, 165 F.3d at 1326.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      The ADA\\'s definition of a \"qualified individual with a disability\" includes an individual who can perform the essential functions of the job she \"holds or desires.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8) (emphasis added). Because the ADA explicitly covers job applicants as well as employees, its protection extends to a former employee with a disability who is qualified for a position she desires. See id. &#167; 12112(a) (prohibiting, inter alia, \"discriminat[ion] . . . in regard to job application procedures\" and \"the hiring . . . of employees\"), &#167; 12112(b)(5)(A) (stating \"discriminate\" includes \"not making reasonable accommodations to the . . . limitations of . . . an applicant or employee\" (emphasis added)); Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1161 (10th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (\"To read the ADA otherwise, would render the word `desires\\' meaningless, and we must avoid such a construction.\" (citations omitted)). McKenzie asked to be considered for any existing job in the Sheriff\\'s Office. Under the ADA, McKenzie is a \"qualified individual\" even if she is no longer qualified as a patrol officer as long as she can perform another job within the Sheriff\\'s Office that she \"desires.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8).\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      According to defendant, McKenzie was denied employment based on conduct, including cutting her wrists and firing her gun at her father\\'s grave, that would preclude her from passing the background check required under Wyoming law. See Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#167; 9-1-704(b)(vi) (requiring background investigations for all peace officer candidates). That argument is flawed in two respects. The background investigation is conducted to determine that candidates \"[h]ave good moral character.\" Id. Defendant does not argue the above-mentioned incidents are relevant to McKenzie\\'s moral character, and such an argument would be implausible. The conduct that precipitated McKenzie\\'s resignation reflects her illness, not an absence of \"good moral character\" that would cause her to fail a background investigation.7\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      More importantly, subject to narrow exceptions such as those for employees who pose a \"direct threat\" to the health or safety of others, Den Hartog v. Wasatch Acad., 129 F.3d 1076, 1087 (10th Cir. 1997), the ADA\\'s anti-discrimination provision \"does not contemplate a stark dichotomy between `disability\\' and `disability-caused misconduct,\\' but rather protects both.\" Nielsen v. Moroni Feed Co., 162 F.3d 604, 608 (10th Cir. 1998) (quoting Den Hartog, 129 F.3d at 1088). In the instant case, the ADA protects McKenzie from adverse employment action based on conduct related to her illness so long as she does not pose a \"direct threat.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12113(a), (b); see Borgialli v. Thunder Basin Coal Co., 235 F.3d 1284, 1295 (10th Cir. 2000) (holding that a disabled plaintiff, to show she is qualified to work in an inherently dangerous job, must show that she does not pose a direct threat to others). A \"direct threat\" is defined as \"a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(3). The determination that an individual is unqualified because she poses a direct threat must be \"based on an individualized assessment of the individual\\'s present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job,\" which in turn must be based on \"a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and\/or on the best available objective evidence.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(r); see also Den Hartog, 129 F.3d at 1089.\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      Defendant has not argued that McKenzie poses a direct threat that could not be eliminated by reasonable accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(3). There is no evidence suggesting in what way, once she had undergone rehabilitation and been cleared by her doctor, employing McKenzie in a position that does not require the use of force would create a direct threat to the public or to her co-workers.8 In fact, when Benton was asked whether McKenzie had \"act[ed] out in any way that . . . was detrimental to the Natrona County Sheriff\\'s [Office] in her performance of her duties,\" he responded \"I can\\'t think of any at this time.\" (Appellant\\'s App. at 111.) See Den Hartog, 129 F.3d at 1088-89 (holding that where the record contained testimony that plaintiff did not pose a direct threat, defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff posed such a threat). As we noted above, Dovala did not even submit McKenzie for a standard psychological test as provided for by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#167; 9-1-704(b)(vii). Without an \"individualized assessment\" of the precise nature and likelihood of the risk stemming from McKenzie\\'s illness, a genuine dispute of material fact remains regarding whether she is qualified to resume a position in the Office where she worked successfully for a decade. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(r). McKenzie may or may not have had a disqualifying mental condition, but that is a question for a jury to answer with all the available evidence before it.\\n    \\n    C. Discrimination\\n    \\n      36\\n      With respect to the third and final element of her prima facie case, McKenzie submitted ample evidence that the Sheriff discriminated against her on the basis of his view that she suffered from a substantially limiting impairment. The ADA defines the term \"discriminate\" to include \"not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(b)(5)(A).\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      Under the ADA, reasonable accommodation includes reassignment to a vacant position as well as \"other similar accommodations.\" Id. &#167; 12111(9)(B). The crux of McKenzie\\'s case is her claim that defendant refused to accommodate her by considering her for a position in which she would not pose a threat to the public. As we noted above, see supra Part III.B, the ADA explicitly protects job applicants as well as employees. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a), &#167; 12112(b)(5)(A). According to McKenzie\\'s deposition testimony, defendant passed over her application when openings became available at least once between her release in November 1996 and her meeting with Dovala in October 1997, and defendant has not advanced any evidence showing that there was no vacant position in one of those departments into which McKenzie could have been hired. The Sheriff\\'s refusal to consider McKenzie for a position in, for example, the jail or the records division is evidence of discrimination under the ADA. Of course, whether McKenzie will ultimately succeed in proving that prohibited discrimination occurred is a different question, one not appropriate for consideration on summary judgment.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      McKenzie submitted sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that she was qualified for a position within the Sheriff\\'s Office, that she had a record of impairment or that the defendant regarded her as substantially limited in her ability to perform a class of jobs, and that he discriminated against her on the basis of that record or belief. Dismissing her claim on summary judgment was therefore improper. While it is disputed whether McKenzie can work safely in the Sheriff\\'s Office, that is precisely the kind of dispute traditionally resolved by a jury, not by a court at the summary judgment stage. The ADA does not require Natrona County to put its staff and the public at risk by employing an individual who poses a threat to others, but it does require the County to provide due consideration to a disabled individual who might be able, with reasonable accommodation, to perform her work productively and safely.\\n    \\n    IV.\\n    \\n      39\\n      We REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        Notes:\\n      \\n      \\n        *\\n         The Honorable Henry A. Politz, Circuit Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         Around the time of her resignation, McKenzie was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder, borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder, single episode, severe.\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         Since the initiation of this suit, Benton has replaced Dovala as Sheriff of Natrona County.\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Although McKenzie was not decertified by the Board upon Benton\\'s request, her certification lapsed in October 1998, two years after her resignation.\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         Plaintiff also brought a claim of retaliation in violation of Title VII, alleging she was denied a position because of her complaints of gender discrimination while still employed by the defendant. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendant, and that claim is not before us on appeal.\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         Recently, the Supreme Court held that the Eleventh Amendment bars suits by state employees to recover money damages for violations of the ADA. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 121 S.Ct. 955, 965 (2001). Because \"the Eleventh Amendment does not extend its immunity to units of local government,\" that decision does not call into question the applicability of the ADA to counties, which are considered units of local government. Id., slip op. at 11 (citing Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529, 530 (1890)); cf. Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280-81 (holding a school board is not entitled to assert Eleventh Amendment immunity because it more closely resembles a county or city than an arm of the state).\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         Our principal case rejecting a claim of disability under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(C) is readily distinguishable. Sorensen v. University of Utah Hospital, 194 F.3d 1084, 1089 (10th Cir. 1999), in which we held that a nurse diagnosed with multiple sclerosis did not establish she was \"regarded as\" disabled by her employer, is inapplicable because the plaintiff in that case alleged only that the hospital regarded her as precluded from holding the position of flight nurse. The plaintiff admitted that the hospital provided her with numerous opportunities to work as a nurse in other units following her diagnosis and hospitalization. Id.\\n        Likewise, in Murphy it was undisputed that the plaintiff, a mechanic, was generally employable in his preferred field. 527 U.S. at 524. He was thus unable to show that he was regarded as restricted in a class of jobs and was \"at most, regarded as unable to perform only a particular job.\" Id. at 525. By contrast, McKenzie submitted uncontroverted evidence that, since her illness, she has been regarded as unemployable in the \"class of jobs utilizing [her] skills.\" Id. at 524.\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         As Dovala and Benton admit, firing a gun in a cemetery, which prompted Dovala to place McKenzie on administrative leave, was not an illegal act.\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         At summary judgment, defendant alleged that employing McKenzie would create \"a significant safety risk.\" (Appellee\\'s App. at 41.) Even if we were to read his motion as raising a \"direct threat\" defense, defendant did not present that argument on appeal, much less support it with a \"reasonable medical judgment\" that relied on \"the best available objective evidence.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(r).\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 160850}]"},{"id":521915,"date_filed":"1989-05-19","judges":"Politz, Reavley, Smith","case_name_full":"Patricia McGEHEE, Wife of\/and W.R.

The collision occurred outside the locks of the Panama Canal.  The Commission\\'s Board of Local Inspectors conducted a prompt inquiry and concluded that the Commission\\'s employee was at fault and that the Commission was responsible.  The Commission attempted to adjust the claim pursuant to section 1412 of the Panama Canal Act of 1979,1 but the parties could not agree on a settlement figure.  The McGehees\\' demand exceeded $120,000 and the Commission reported the claim to Congress, as then required by sections 1412 and 1415 of the Act.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      In 1985 Congress amended section 1416 of the Act2 to permit an aggrieved party to sue the Commission in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.3   The McGehees did so.  Liability was stipulated;  damages were contested.  The district court awarded the McGehees $93,900 for property damage, the cost of transporting the ketch, living expenses during the repair period, and other miscellaneous expenses.  The court also awarded 8 1\/2 prejudgment interest from date of the casualty to date of judgment, and thereafter postjudgment interest at the legal rate.  The government appeals.\\n    \\n    Analysis\\n    \\n      4\\n      We begin with the general proposition that sovereign immunity bars an award of interest against the United States.  Perez v. United States, 830 F.2d 54 (5th Cir.1987).  The rule admits of exceptions, two of which are relevant in this case.4   The United States may be ordered to pay interest when Congress has expressly consented to such an award, Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.S. 310, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 92 L.Ed.2d 250 (1986), and when Congress has shed the cloak of sovereignty and given an agency the status of a commercial operation, Loeffler v. Frank, --- U.S. ----, 108 S.Ct. 1965, 100 L.Ed.2d 549 (1988).  The focus of the first exception is whether the legislation giving rise to the cause of action expressly subjects the government to interest payments.  The second exception turns on whether Congress, in creating the agency, intended a waiver of immunity from interest awards.  In the case at bar, the statutory scheme giving rise to the McGehees\\' cause of action--the Panama Canal Act of 1979, implementing the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, T.I.A.S. No. 10030--also creates the agency involved, the Panama Canal Commission.5\\n    \\n    1. Express waiver\\n    \\n      5\\n      In Library of Congress v. Shaw, the Supreme Court considered whether Congress had expressly waived interest immunity when it enacted section 706(k) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(k).  In discussing the issue, the Court observed:\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      This basic rule of sovereign immunity, in conjunction with the requirement of an agreement to pay interest, gave rise to the rule that interest cannot be recovered unless the award of interest was affirmatively and separately contemplated by Congress.  See, e.g., United States ex rel. Angarica v. Bayard, 127 U.S. 251, 260 [8 S.Ct. 1156, 1161, 32 L.Ed. 159] (1888) (\"The case, therefore, falls within the well-settled principle, that the United States is not liable to pay interest on claims against them, in the absence of express statutory provision to that effect\").  The purpose of the rule is to permit the Government to \"occupy an apparently favored position,\" United States v. Verdier, 164 U.S. 213, 219 [17 S.Ct. 42, 44, 41 L.Ed. 407] (1896), by protecting it from claims for interest that would prevail against private parties.  See 4 Op.Atty.Gen. 136, 137 (1842).\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      For well over a century, this Court, executive agencies, and Congress itself consistently have recognized that federal statutes cannot be read to permit interest to run on a recovery against the United States unless Congress affirmatively mandates that result.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Shaw, 478 U.S. at 315-16, 106 S.Ct. at 2962-63.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      The Court concluded that section 706(k), which renders the government liable \"the same as a private person\" for costs and attorneys\\' fees in a Title VII action, does not contain an express waiver of immunity from interest payments.  In making that determination, the Court stated:\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      In analyzing whether Congress has waived the immunity of the United States, we must construe waivers strictly in favor of the sovereign, see McMahon v. United States, 342 U.S. 25, 27 [72 S.Ct. 17, 19, 96 L.Ed. 26] (1951), and not enlarge the waiver \" \\'beyond what the language requires,\\' \" Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U.S. 680, 685-686 [103 S.Ct. 3274, 3277-78, 77 L.Ed.2d 938] (1983), quoting Eastern Transportation Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 675, 686 [47 S.Ct. 289, 291, 71 L.Ed. 472] (1927).  The no-interest rule provides an added gloss of strictness upon these usual rules.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Shaw, 478 U.S. at 318, 106 S.Ct. at 2963.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      The McGehees\\' suit against the Panama Canal Commission was brought under section 1416 of the Panama Canal Act of 1979, which contains no reference to an award of interest.6   Section 1413 of the Act7 provides the measure of damages \"for injuries to a vessel for which the Commission is determined to be liable.\"    In adopting section 1413, Congress reenacted almost verbatim the provisions of section 293 of the Canal Zone Code, legislation ordained pursuant to the Panama Canal Treaty of 1903.  In Gulf Oil Corp. v. Panama Canal Co., 481 F.2d 561, 569 (5th Cir.1973) (Gulfspray III ), we held that section 293 provided for \"a recovery of damages substantially parallel to that accorded by the general maritime law.\"    In addition to discussing a number of damages recoverable under section 293, we concluded that the Panama Canal Company was liable for prejudgment interest.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Congress cited Gulfspray III in the House Report accompanying H.R. 111, the bill that eventually became the 1979 Act.  Specifically, in explaining the scope of a provision that became section 1416, the House Report states:\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Measure of damages generally.--This section would reenact the provisions of paragraph (c) of 2 C.Z. Code 293....\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      This section has been construed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit as establishing rules for recovery of damages substantially parallel to that accorded by general maritime law.  Gulf Oil Corp. v. Panama Canal Company, 481 F.2d 561 (5th Cir.1973).\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      H.R.Rep. No. 98, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 65-66, reprinted in 1979 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1034, 1068.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      The McGehees refer to this portion of the legislative history and to Gulfspray III as authority for the proposition that there exists express congressional consent to an award of interest.  To accept this proposition we would have to assume that in enacting section 293 Congress impliedly waived immunity from interest vulnerability,8 an assumption which is impermissible after Shaw.    Nor is the reference to Gulfspray III in the legislative history sufficient to carry the day.  Several items of damages were at issue in that case.  We are not persuaded that the general legislative reference may be taken as specifically blessing over the interest award.9   Even if Congress so intended, such intent would not cross the Shaw threshold:\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      \"[T]here can be no consent by implication or by use of ambiguous language.  Nor can an intent on the part of the framers of a statute or contract to permit the recovery of interest suffice where the intent is not translated into affirmative statutory or contractual terms.  The consent necessary to waive the traditional immunity must be express, and it must be strictly construed.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      Shaw, 478 U.S. at 318, 106 S.Ct. at 2963 (quoting United States v. N.Y. Rayon Importing Co., 329 U.S. 654, 659, 67 S.Ct. 601, 604, 91 L.Ed. 577 (1947)).\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      Absent express statutory consent to an award of interest,10 we conclude, as did the court a quo, that interest cannot be assessed against the Commission on the basis of the express-waiver exception to the no-interest rule.\\n    \\n    2. Commercial enterprise\\n    \\n      21\\n      In allowing interest on a judgment ordering payment under insurance policies issued by the United States, the Court opined in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 267 U.S. 76, 79, 45 S.Ct. 211, 212, 69 L.Ed. 519 (1925):\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      When the United States went into the insurance business, issued policies in familiar form and provided that in case of disagreement it might be sued, it must be assumed to have accepted the ordinary incidents of suits in such business.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Three score years later in Shaw, the Court cited Standard Oil, observing:\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      The no-interest rule is similarly inapplicable where the Government has cast off the cloak of sovereignty and assumed the status of a private commercial enterprise.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      Shaw, 478 U.S. at 317 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. at 2963 n. 5.    While merely dicta in Shaw, the commercial-enterprise exception to the no-interest rule served as the basis for an award of interest against the United States Postal Service in Loeffler v. Frank.    Loeffler sued the Postal Service under Title VII and won reinstatement with back pay.  The trial court and court of appeals declined to award interest.  The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that section 401 of the Postal Reorganization Act provided a waiver of sovereign immunity from interest awards against the Postal Service.11\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Central to the Court\\'s conclusion that the agency\\'s interest immunity had been waived was the fact that Congress had empowered it to sue and be sued.  The Court noted:\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      Congress ... has waived the sovereign immunity of certain federal entities from the times of their inception by including in the enabling legislation provisions that they may sue and be sued.  In FHA v. Burr, 309 U.S. 242, 245, 60 S.Ct. 488, 490, 84 L.Ed. 724 (1940), the Court explained:\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      \"[S]uch waivers by Congress of governmental immunity ... should be liberally construed....  Hence, when Congress establishes such an agency, authorizes it to engage in commercial and business transactions with the public, and permits it to \\'sue and be sued,\\' it cannot be lightly assumed that restrictions on that authority are to be implied ... In the absence of [a clear showing that certain suits are not consistent with the statutory or constitutional scheme], it must be presumed that when Congress launched a governmental agency into the commercial world and endowed it with authority to \\'sue and be sued,\\' that agency is not less amenable to judicial process than a private enterprise under like circumstances would be.\"    (Footnote omitted.)\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      Encompassed within this liberal-construction rule is the principle \"that the words \\'sue and be sued\\' normally include the natural and appropriate incidents of legal proceedings.\"    [Reconstruction Finance Corp. v.] J.G. Menihan Corp., 312 U.S.   at 85 [61 S.Ct. 485 at 487, 85 L.Ed. 595 (1941) ].\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      Loeffler, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 108 S.Ct. at 1969, 100 L.Ed.2d at 556-57 (some citations omitted).\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      In establishing the Panama Canal Commission,12 Congress did not enable it to sue and be sued.  The McGehees acknowledge this fact and the holding in Loeffler, but maintain that the words \"sue and be sued\" are not talismanic.  They contend that when the government enters the business world, as they claim it has in this case, its interest immunity is waived despite the absence of a sue-and-be-sued clause.13   Assuming per arguendo that a sue-and-be-sued clause is not essential,14 we conclude that an award of interest against the Commission would be inappropriate because the Commission does not operate as a commercial venture.15\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      The Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 grants the United States the right to manage, operate, and maintain the Panama Canal, responsibilities to be exercised by the Panama Canal Commission.  The annex to the treaty lists certain functions to be performed by the Commission, most of which are not of a commercial nature, together with certain activities the Commission may not do, most of which are of a commercial nature.  (See Appendix.)\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      In addition to the language of the treaty and implementing statutes, we find further support for the conclusion that the Commission is not a commercial operation in the legislative history.  In deciding the appropriate form for the Commission, Congress considered a continuation of the corporate form of the predecessor Panama Canal Company, but that idea was rejected.16   The legislative history of H.R. 111, which eventually became the 1979 Act, tells why:\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      Now, under the 1977 treaty, substantially all the collateral revenue-producing business activities of the corporation are to be transferred to Panama;  private business is to be introduced into the area that had been the Canal Zone;  and the sole remaining mission of the Panama Canal Commission is to be limited to the operation of the canal.\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      Despite the fact that the canal generates revenue, the purpose of the canal is not commercial but governmental, and the criteria that are used in the selection of the corporate form for a government agency conducting business operations ... simply do not apply.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      * * *\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      A second consideration involved ... is whether the mission of the agency is, in fact, to carry on a business or to perform a governmental function.  The Supreme Court has expressly held that the operation of the canal is a governmental exercise of the power of Congress to regulate commerce, rather than a proprietary or business activity of the Government.

Otherwise, it could not be reconciled with the teachings of Boston Sand and Gravel Co. v. United States, 278 U.S. 41, 46, 49 S.Ct. 52, 53, 73 L.Ed. 170 (1928).  That case informs that Congress had not waived the government\\'s interest immunity in enacting the Act of May 15, 1922, 42 Stat. 1590, which, in cases arising from a collision between a United States warship and a private vessel, authorized the district court to award \" \\'the amount of the legal damages sustained by reason of said collision ... upon the same principle and measure of liability with costs as in like cases in admiralty between private parties with the same rights of appeal.\\' \"\\n      \\n      \\n        9\\n         The entity in Gulfspray III was the Panama Canal Company.  When Congress referred to Gulfspray III it was aware that the Panama Canal Company had been abolished by the 1977 treaty and that the replacement Commission differed markedly\\n      \\n      \\n        10\\n         In Shaw, 478 U.S. at 318, 106 S.Ct. at 2963, the Court noted that \"[w]hen Congress has intended to waive the United States\\' immunity with respect to interest, it has done so expressly.\"    To underscore this point the Court cited several statutes that include express congressional waivers of the government\\'s interest immunity:  \"28 U.S.C. Sec. 2411 (expressly authorizing prejudgment and post-judgment interest payable by the United States in tax-refund cases);  31 U.S.C. Sec. 1304 (appropriating funds for interest on certain district court judgments);  26 U.S.C. Sec. 7426(g) (providing for interest in cases of wrongful levy by Internal Revenue Service).\"    478 U.S. at 318 n. 6, 106 S.Ct. at 2963 n. 6\\n      \\n      \\n        11\\n         Having so concluded, the Loeffler court found it unnecessary to \"search for an express waiver of immunity from interest within Title VII,\" as it had in Shaw.    Loeffler, --- U.S. at ----, 108 S.Ct. at 1974, 100 L.Ed.2d at 563\\n      \\n      \\n        12\\n         Section 1101 of the 1979 Act, 22 U.S.C. Sec. 3611, provides in pertinent part:\\n        There is established in the executive branch of the United States Government an agency to be known as the Panama Canal Commission....  The Commission shall, under the general supervision of the Board established by section 1102 of this Act, be responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Panama Canal and the facilities and appurtenances related thereto.\\n      \\n      \\n        13\\n         Although we have held that the presence of a sue-and-be-sued clause does not automatically result in a waiver of the United States\\' interest immunity, see A.L.T. Corp. v. Small Business Admin., 823 F.2d 126 (5th Cir.1987);  R &amp; R Farm Enter., Inc. v. Federal Crop Ins. Corp., 788 F.2d 1148 (5th Cir.1986), we are aware of no case in this or any other circuit in which a court has awarded interest against a government entity that is not empowered \"to sue and be sued,\" excepting, of course, those cases in which the express-waiver exception to the no-interest rule was found applicable\\n      \\n      \\n        14\\n         Without deciding the issue, we note that in Loeffler the Court observed that because the Library of Congress is not a \" \\'sue-and-be-sued\\' agency\" that has been \" \\'launched ... into the commercial world,\\' \" the Shaw Court did not examine whether interest could be awarded against the Library on what we refer to as the commercial-enterprise exception to the no-interest rule.  See Loeffler, --- U.S. at ----, 108 S.Ct. at 1974, 100 L.Ed.2d at 563\\n      \\n      \\n        15\\n         In Gulf Oil Corp. v. Panama Canal Co., 407 F.2d 24 (5th Cir.1969) (Gulfspray I ), we held that in granting the Panama Canal Company the power to sue and be sued and placing it in charge of all business operations in the Canal Zone, Congress waived the Company\\'s sovereign immunity.  In Gulfspray III, we concluded that interest could be awarded against the Company.  The 1903 Treaty, under which the Panama Canal Company operated, was replaced by the Treaty of 1977.  The 1977 Treaty and implementing legislation created the Commission, vesting it with power to perform a range of duties in the exercise of the rights of the United States with respect to management, operation, and maintenance of the Panama Canal.  However, the Commission is not empowered to perform many commercial activities previously performed by the Panama Canal Company.  As a consequence of these marked changes in the structure and functions of the Commission, in light of the teachings of Shaw and Loeffler, we conclude that Gulfspray III has little applicability to the issue at bar\\n      \\n      \\n        16\\n         The Senate counterpart to H.R. 111 proposed establishing the Commission in corporate form.

Secs. 1001 et seq., requires a plan fiduciary to disclose to a plan participant the specific reasons for a denial of benefits.  The question here is whether that obligation requires a fiduciary to disclose to a discharged employee, who applies for early retirement benefits, the reasons for his discharge if the denial of benefits is otherwise in accordance with the plan.  The district court held that ERISA created no such obligation here.  We affirm.\\n    \\n    I.\\n    \\n      2\\n      Plaintiff Andrew P. Dzinglski worked for defendant Weirton Steel Corporation from May 12, 1959 until his termination for cause on October 31, 1984.  At the time of his discharge he was 46 years old.  Weirton maintains a pension plan in which plaintiff was a participant.  The plan is administered by the Retirement Committee of the Weirton Steel Corporation Retirement Plan.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      The Weirton plan provides an early retirement \"Rule-of-65\" pension.  The Rule-of-65 pension provides eligible employees with an actuarially unreduced early retirement benefit in addition to a $400 monthly supplement, paid until normal retirement age.  Eligibility for the Rule-of-65 pension is conditioned upon the attainment of minimum age and years of service and the occurrence of one of several contingencies.  For hourly employees, for example, the contingencies include:  service broken by reason of a layoff or disability;  absence from work by reason of layoff resulting from an election to be placed on layoff status pursuant to the agreement applicable in the event of a permanent shutdown;  absence from work by reason of a physical disability or layoff where return to active employment is declared unlikely by Weirton;  or retirement that Weirton and the employee consider to be in their respective interests.1   The relevant contingency here is the mutual stipulation of both the employee and Weirton that the employee\\'s retirement is in their respective interests.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Plaintiff applied for a Rule-of-65 pension the day he was terminated.  He met the age and service criteria but Weirton did not consider his retirement to be in its interest.  Accordingly, by letter dated November 5, 1984, the Retirement Committee denied plaintiff\\'s application, informing him that Rule-of-65 benefits are not available where \"service has been broken for reasons other than layoff or disability, and Company approval for such benefits has not been granted.\"    Plaintiff appealed this denial and a hearing was held before the Retirement Committee on March 18, 1985.  On April 12, 1985, the Committee affirmed its denial of plaintiff\\'s application for the reasons set forth in its November 5, 1984 letter.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Plaintiff filed suit in the Northern District of West Virginia on October 22, 1985, alleging that defendants\\' denial of pension benefits violated ERISA\\'s internal review and notice provisions.  The district court determined that plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  Specifically, the court found that 1) Rule-of-65 retirement, \"conditioned upon Weirton\\'s consent, does not violate ERISA;\"  2) Rule-of-65 retirement does not violate ERISA\\'s reporting and disclosure requirements;  3) Weirton\\'s determination that plaintiff\\'s early retirement was not in its interest was not undertaken in a fiduciary capacity;  and 4) \"plaintiff was not deprived of a full and fair review of his retirement application by the Retirement Committee by reason of the alleged nondisclosure of Weirton\\'s reason for not finding Plaintiff\\'s retirement to be in its interest[ ].\"\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Plaintiff appeals.\\n    \\n    II.\\n    \\n      7\\n      The Weirton plan provides in relevant part that:\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      (b) The Retirement Committee shall have all powers and duties necessary or appropriate to operate and administer the Plan, including, but not limited to, the following specific functions:\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      (1) To act on applications for benefits.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      (2) To determine eligibility, service, earnings, and other questions.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      The Retirement Committee ascertains eligibility by determining whether an applicant meets Rule-of-65 criteria:  whether the applicant meets minimum age and years of service requirements and, in this case, whether there exists the mutual assent of both the employee and Weirton that the employee\\'s retirement is in their respective interests.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      ERISA requires that every employee benefit plan provide written notice to any participant of the reasons an application for benefits is denied and a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of the denial by an appropriate fiduciary.  29 U.S.C. Sec. 1133.  Dzinglski argues that he did not receive a fair hearing under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1133 because the Retirement Committee did not disclose to him the precise reasons that Weirton did not determine his retirement to be \"in its interest,\" thus preventing him from contesting the reasons for Weirton\\'s refusal of his claim for benefits.  He claims it is not sufficient for a fiduciary to inform a participant that the employer does not agree that retirement is in its interest.  The fiduciary must further advise the participant why the employer refuses to agree.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      We disagree.  ERISA\\'s obligation to notify a participant of the reasons for the denial of benefits does not require a plan fiduciary to disclose an employer\\'s specific reasons for determining that an employee\\'s application for early retirement is not in its interest.  The plan does not permit the Retirement Committee to examine Weirton\\'s decision in that regard.  It does not authorize the Retirement Committee to determine Weirton\\'s interest, only to ascertain Weirton\\'s assent.  A trustee must strictly adhere to the terms of the plan and inform a participant of the reasons for the denial of his benefits according to the plan, not advance an employer\\'s separate determination of its own interests.  Hlinka v. Bethlehem Steel Corporation, 863 F.2d 279, 286 (3d Cir.1988);  Hickman v. Tosco Corporation, 840 F.2d 564, 566 (8th Cir.1988);  Moehle v. NL Industries, Inc., 646 F.Supp. 769, 777 (E.D.Mo.1986), aff\\'d, 845 F.2d 1027 (8th Cir.1988);  Foltz v. U.S. News &amp; World Report, Inc., 613 F.Supp. 634, 639 (D.D.C.1985).\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      The Retirement Committee did, of course, hold a hearing and inform Dzinglski why his benefits were denied.  By letter dated November 5, 1984, the Committee notified appellant that his application was denied because \"Rule-of-65 retirement benefits are not available where, as in your case, service has been broken for reasons other than layoff or disability, and Company approval for such benefits has not been granted.\"    Following a hearing, requested by appellant, the Committee reaffirmed its denial of appellant\\'s application for the reasons set forth in the letter of November 5.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      While Dzinglski claims the Committee\\'s explanation for the denial was inadequate, the sufficiency of the explanation is not to be judged in a vacuum but under the terms of the plan.  In terms of the plan the statement of reasons was adequate.  There was no dispute that Dzinglski met the objective criteria of age and service.  There was also no dispute that eligibility under the plan was premised upon the employer\\'s assent and that assent in Dzinglski\\'s case had been withheld.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      We reject appellant\\'s attempt to transform the provisions of this early retirement plan into a forum for a wrongful discharge action.  To require a fiduciary to disclose the specific reasons for Weirton\\'s determination converts ERISA\\'s disclosure and internal review obligations into a procedure wherein the participant can contest an employer\\'s assessment of its own interests and ultimately, if applicable, the reasons for an employee\\'s discharge.  If Dzinglski\\'s claim is that Weirton erred in discharging him for cause rather than permitting him to retire, that too is simply a variation of a wrongful discharge suit.  In either case, the reasons for the discharge and Weirton\\'s conduct in ordering it would be placed in dispute.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      An employee\\'s discharge may properly be litigated pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e et seq., the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. Secs. 621-34, the relevant collective bargaining agreement, or exceptions to the employee-at-will doctrine.  If there is a wrongful discharge, the remedial provisions of the foregoing actions may well encompass an award of benefits.  To subject employers to a potential waterfall of wrongful discharge actions, by permitting plan participants to litigate the correctness of their discharge through the \"full and fair review\" provision of ERISA, would discourage employers from instituting early retirement plans, which ERISA does not require.  Hlinka, 863 F.2d at 284.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      Dzinglski contends, in essence, that the provision in issue has a high-handed quality because it permits the employer to declare unilaterally that early retirement is \"not in its interest.\"    Dzinglski does not allege, however, that the plan here is improper and indeed plans which condition eligibility for early retirement benefits on an employer\\'s determination that an employee\\'s retirement is in its interest are permissible.  Hlinka, 863 F.2d at 284.    There is no requirement that employee benefit plans in collective bargaining contracts, for example, withstand judicial review under a general standard of reasonableness.  UMWA Health &amp; Retirement Funds v. Robinson, 455 U.S. 562, 574-76, 102 S.Ct. 1226, 1233-34, 71 L.Ed.2d 419 (1982);  Viggiano v. Shenango China Div. of Anchor Hocking Corp., 750 F.2d 276, 279-80 (3d Cir.1984).  Rather, \"Congress left employers much discretion in designing their plans\" under ERISA and in determining the level and conditions of benefits.  Hlinka, 863 F.2d at 283.    The judicial role is not to rewrite plan provisions, but to assure that they are fairly administered.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      If there is a magisterial tone to the Weirton plan provision it derives from the fact that under ERISA the institution of plans is largely voluntary and the fashioning of plan elements has been left largely in the hands of individual employers.  Here Weirton has designed a plan whose primary beneficiaries were apparently those whose Rule-of-65 retirements resulted from disability, layoffs, or force reductions, and not from termination for cause.  See Weirton Plan, note 1, supra.    While there may be limits on the extent to which an employer can avoid judicial review of plan administration by shifting the effective decision to deny benefits from a plan fiduciary to itself, we do not think those limits have been exceeded in the context of an early retirement provision which is but one of numerous means of establishing eligibility for such benefits and where all such means are framed in the disjunctive.  See note 1, supra.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      In a case analogous to the present one, Bethlehem Steel Corporation sponsored a \"70\/80\" early retirement pension, conditioning eligibility for the benefit on Bethlehem\\'s determination that an applicant\\'s retirement was \"in its interest.\"    Hlinka, 863 F.2d 279.    The plan administrator refused to grant Hlinka a 70\/80 pension because Bethlehem declined to make the requisite determination.  The Third Circuit concluded that the denial of Hlinka\\'s benefits was proper because Bethlehem did not deem it to be in its interest for Hlinka to retire and such a determination did not violate the spirit of ERISA.  Id. at 284.    The same conclusion is compelled here.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      The cases on which Dzinglski relies for the proposition that the Committee should have disclosed to him the totality of evidence supporting the denial of benefits are inapposite;  in all of them, Brown v. Retirement Committee of Briggs &amp; Stratton, 797 F.2d 521, 532-33 (7th Cir.1986);  Short v. Central States, S.E. &amp; S.W. Areas Pension Fund, 729 F.2d 567, 574-75 (8th Cir.1984);  Richardson v. Central States, S.E. &amp; S.W. Areas Pension Fund, 645 F.2d 660, 665 (8th Cir.1981);  Wardle v. Central States, S.E. &amp; S.W. Areas Pension Fund, 627 F.2d 820, 827 &amp; 828 n. 17 (7th Cir.1980), the trustees were vested with the discretionary authority to grant or deny benefits.  Here the Retirement Committee is not vested with discretionary authority.  The Retirement Committee can only determine whether Dzinglski met the eligibility standards of the plan, one of which was that Weirton determine his retirement to be in its interest.  Appellant presented no evidence that Weirton did so and, accordingly, the Retirement Committee had to deny appellant benefits.  Pursuant to Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989), we review the trustee\\'s decision de novo, and we find it conforms to the terms of the plan.\\n    \\n    III.\\n    A.\\n    \\n      22\\n      Dzinglski also contends that Weirton\\'s refusal to stipulate his retirement was in its interest violated its fiduciary duty pursuant to 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1104 and that the Retirement Committee did not act for the sole and exclusive benefit of appellant.  Id.  Neither claim is persuasive.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      A \"person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent ... he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.\"    29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(21)(A).  When an employer is administering an employee benefit plan, that employer \"must satisfy the exacting fiduciary standards imposed by ERISA.\"    Sutton v. Weirton Steel Division of National Steel Corporation, 724 F.2d 406, 411 (4th Cir.1983).  ERISA, however, does not \"prohibit an employer from acting in accordance with its interests as employer when not administering the plan or investing its assets.\"    Phillips v. Amoco Oil Co., 799 F.2d 1464, 1471 (11th Cir.1986).  Business decisions can still be made for business reasons, notwithstanding their collateral effect on prospective, contingent employee benefits.  Sutton v. Weirton Steel, 567 F.Supp. 1184, 1200-01 (N.D.W.Va.), aff\\'d, 724 F.2d 406 (4th Cir.1983).\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      Here Weirton\\'s determination of its interests was not fiduciary in nature.  It was acting in its capacity as Dzlingski\\'s employer, not as a fiduciary, when it decided to discharge him.  The Weirton plan provides that personnel decisions are the exclusive province of Weirton as employer, not as plan sponsor or fiduciary:\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      Nothing contained in the Plan shall be deemed to give any Employee, Participant or Contributory Participant the right to be retained in the service of Weirton or to interfere with the right of Weirton to discharge, lay off or suspend any Employee, Participant or Contributory Participant at any time without regard to the effect which such discharge, layoff or suspension shall have upon his rights or the rights of any beneficiary, surviving spouse or co-pensioner under the Plan.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      In Moehle v. NL Industries, Inc., 646 F.Supp. 769 (E.D.Mo.1986), the court relied on a similar pension plan provision to conclude that the employer did not have fiduciary duties \"when it was acting in its capacity as employer making employment decisions.\"    Id. at 779 &amp; n. 5.    See also Hickman, 840 F.2d at 567 (employer not acting as fiduciary when deciding which employees to terminate);  Ogden v. Michigan Bell Telephone Co., 657 F.Supp. 328, 335 (E.D.Mich.1987) (employer not acting as fiduciary when determining appropriate number of employees to be eliminated in force reduction).  But see Fielding v. International Harvester Co., 815 F.2d 1254, 1257 (9th Cir.1987).\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      Likewise, appellant\\'s contention that the Retirement Committee violated its fiduciary duty is without merit.  While ERISA requires a fiduciary to discharge its duties \"solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries,\" 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1104(a)(1), the fiduciary must do so \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan....\"  Id. at Sec. 1104(a)(1)(D).  As we have noted, the Retirement Committee acted in accordance with the terms of the plan.  To adhere to the plan is not a breach of fiduciary duty.  See Hickman, 840 F.2d at 566;  Moehle, 646 F.Supp. at 777;  Foltz, 613 F.Supp. at 639.\\n    \\n    B.\\n    \\n      28\\n      Finally, Dzinglski argues that the Weirton plan violates ERISA\\'s disclosure requirements, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1022, by failing to disclose that Rule-of-65 provisions are not granted to employees discharged for cause.  We find no such violation.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      Section 1022 requires that a plan description contain information on \"circumstances which may result in disqualification, ineligibility, or denial or loss of benefits.\"    Although it is not clear whether Sec. 1022(a) requires a plan to disclose the circumstances under which forfeitable pension benefits like appellant\\'s may be denied, Phillips, 799 F.2d at 1472 n. 3, the requirement of Weirton\\'s approval of an application under \"mutually satisfactory conditions\" is explicitly set forth.  See Pompano v.

Jackson sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e through 2000e-17 (1982), charging gender-based discrimination.  She named as defendants both the University and the dean of the Business School, John McArthur.  After a bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled against her.  Jackson v. Harvard Univ., 721 F.Supp. 1397 (D.Mass.1989).  Having carefully considered plaintiff\\'s arguments on appeal and digested the rather imposing record, we find no significant legal error and therefore affirm.\\n    \\n    I. BACKGROUND\\n    \\n      2\\n      The evidence is exhaustively and accurately detailed in the opinion below, id. at 1399-1401, 1415-28, and it would be pleonastic to rehearse it here.  We offer instead a synopsis designed to do no more than give needed context to the legal principles involved.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Tenure decisions at the Business School are subject to an exacting protocol.  A subcommittee comprised of four faculty members measures the aspirant against the prescribed standards and presents an advisory report to the tenured faculty as a whole.  The full faculty conducts its own review of the candidate.  Two votes are taken by signed ballot, some weeks apart.  While these tallies are not binding stricto senso, the dean will generally not recommend tenure to Harvard\\'s president and governing boards unless a candidate commands substantial majority support within the faculty.  As a practical matter, a decision by the dean not to recommend tenure is final.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Appellant began teaching at the Business School in 1973 with the rank of assistant professor.  In 1977, she was promoted to associate professor.  She was considered for tenure twice.  At her 1981 review, she requested that certain faculty members be excluded from the first-level subcommittee.  Such requests are not uncommon and are, for the most part, routinely allowed.  In this instance, Jackson\\'s wishes were honored with one exception:  Professor Stephen Bradley was retained on the subcommittee despite Jackson\\'s claim that Bradley was biased against women.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      The subcommittee, including Bradley, performed its assigned functions.  In general, the subcommittee\\'s evaluation was favorable.  Three of the members believed that Jackson merited tenure and that her main work, a book, met the required scholastic standards.  Bradley disagreed with his colleagues\\' assessment of the book but voted to recommend tenure notwithstanding.  At the first meeting of the tenured faculty, a substantial majority of those present favored appellant\\'s promotion.  In the final balloting, however, that majority evaporated and the faculty split rather evenly.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      The Business School temporized:  Jackson\\'s appointment was extended for three years and her tenure review held in abeyance.  Appellant acquiesced in this arrangement.  When she was reconsidered for tenure in 1983, however, she received only a slim majority in the vote of the full faculty.  Eventually, tenure was denied.  This litigation followed in due season.\\n    \\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n    \\n      7\\n      The standard of review is crucial to the appellate task in this fact-intensive environment.  \"When a district court sits without a jury, the court of appeals cannot undertake to decide factual issues afresh.\"    Reliance Steel Prod. Co. v. Nat\\'l Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 575, 576 (1st Cir.1989).  Rather, constrained by the Civil Rules,1 we review factual findings only for clear error.  Keyes v. Secretary of the Navy, 853 F.2d 1016, 1019 (1st Cir.1988);  Irons v. FBI, 811 F.2d 681, 684 (1st Cir.1987);  Johnson v. Allyn &amp; Bacon, Inc., 731 F.2d 64, 71 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1018, 105 S.Ct. 433, 83 L.Ed.2d 359 (1984).  Fidelity to Rule 52(a) means that deference must be paid to the findings below:  \"It is not enough that [an appellate court] might give the facts another construction, resolve the ambiguities differently, and find a more sinister cast to actions which the district court apparently deemed innocent.\"    United States v. Nat\\'l Assoc. of Real Estate Boards, 339 U.S. 485, 495, 70 S.Ct. 711, 717, 94 L.Ed. 1007 (1950);  see also Keyes, 853 F.2d at 1020.    Put bluntly, \"[a]ppellate review of complex, fact-dominated issues cannot be allowed to descend to the level of Monday-morning quarterbacking.\"    Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d 388 at 392-393 (1st Cir. Mar. 26, 1990).  At the bottom line, \"[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\\'s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\"    Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).\\n    \\n    III. THE MERITS\\n    \\n      8\\n      Visualizing the record through the prism of Rule 52(a) clarifies the result we must reach.  We do not pause to restate the recognized burden-shifting framework characteristic of Title VII cases involving circumstantial proof of discrimination, see, e.g., Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093-95, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981);  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-26, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973);  Keyes, 853 F.2d at 1023, but assume the reader\\'s familiarity with so commonplace a rule.  The record leaves no doubt but that the first two steps in the Burdine pavane were accomplished:  (1) appellant made out a prima facie case and (2) defendants articulated a reason (failure to demonstrate the required scholarship) which, if authentic, was nondiscriminatory and sufficient to ground the tenure denial.  Plaintiff then ascended to the framework\\'s next stage, endeavoring to show that defendants\\' professed reason was a pretext for discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      Given this posture, the proper focus of appellate inquiry must be the district court\\'s ultimate finding of discrimination vel non.  See Dance v. Ripley, 776 F.2d 370, 373 (1st Cir.1985);  Johnson, 731 F.2d at 70.    And in that regard,\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      reviewing courts should [not] treat discrimination differently from other ultimate questions of fact.  Nor should they make their inquiry even more difficult by applying legal rules which were devised to govern \\'the basic allocation of burdens and order of proof\\' in deciding this ultimate question.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      United States Postal Serv. Bd. of Govs. v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 716, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 1482, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 252, 101 S.Ct. at 1093).\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Stripped of legalistic jargon, appellant\\'s principal contentions rest squarely on this ultimate question.  Her core claim reduces to the assertion that, had the facts been judged properly, she would have prevailed. In the Rule 52 milieu, this is a high hurdle to vault, especially since articulation of defendants\\' reasons dissipated the evidentiary force of the original presumption.  See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255, 101 S.Ct. at 1094;  Keyes, 853 F.2d at 1023.    The task of showing clear error is daunting--more so, perhaps, in a case like this, since courts must be mindful of the essentially subjective nature of tenure decisions and, therefore, \"must take special care to preserve the University\\'s autonomy in making lawful tenure decisions.\"    Brown v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 891 F.2d 337, 346 (1st Cir.1989).\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Appellant attempts to avoid the looming problem by claiming that the Burdine framework was inapplicable and that the burden of proof should have been allocated more favorably to her.  But upon close perscrutation, this contention seems no more than an unfounded effort \"to wriggle out from beneath Rule 52(a) by claiming that the district court mistook the law.\"    Reliance Steel, 880 F.2d at 577.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      If a plaintiff can provide direct evidence that gender bias infected the decisionmaking process, the Burdine framework becomes irrelevant and the burden shifts to defendant to prove that the same decision would have ensued in the absence of the alleged discrimination.  See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 1787-88, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (plurality op.);    Fields v. Clark Univ., 817 F.2d 931, 935-37 (1st Cir.1987).  Jackson says her case qualifies under this rubric by reason of two key evidentiary items:  (1) McArthur told her that \"if [the government or the public] wanted women on the [Business School] faculty in larger numbers, they would have to impose quotas because otherwise Harvard would go through the affirmative action procedures but would not actually promote women;\"  and (2) she was treated differently from male applicants in that Bradley was allowed to serve as a member of the 1981 subcommittee over Jackson\\'s objection.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      Plaintiff\\'s glass is half full.  The district court, to be sure, found it \"likely\" that McArthur \"made some version of the [attributed] statement.\"    721 F.Supp. at 1433.    The court also found that Jackson had suffered disparate treatment in respect to Bradley\\'s inclusion on the screening panel.  Id. at 1434.    Nonetheless, the glass is also half empty:  calling the evidence \"direct\" does not make it so, but merely camouflages the terrain.  Seen in context, appellant has done no more than dress two factual disputes in rather ill-fitting \"legal\" costumery.  She does not profit by such a masquerade.  See Reliance Steel, 880 F.2d at 577.    What appellant\\'s analysis conveniently overlooks is that the inference sought to be drawn from her evidence--that gender bias skewed the decisionmaking process--is precisely a question of fact, and one which the district court resolved contrary to the interpretation urged by appellant.  We explain briefly.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Direct evidence is evidence which, in and of itself, shows a discriminatory animus.  Here, the district court, citing both McArthur\\'s testimony that he held strong beliefs otherwise and the Business School\\'s widely-admired affirmative action program, found Jackson\\'s construction of McArthur\\'s comment \"strained.\"    721 F.Supp. at 1433.    The court also found that \"whatever caused Dean McArthur to reject [Jackson\\'s] request to exclude Professor Bradley from [Jackson\\'s] subcommittee, it was not gender bias.\"    Id. at 1434 (emphasis supplied).  Moreover, Bradley\\'s participation \"played at most a de minimis role in the ultimate decision not to offer plaintiff tenure in 1981.\"    Id.  The court based its conclusions concerning the subcommittee\\'s composition on a medley of considerations, including the absence of any persuasive evidence that Bradley was prejudiced against women;  his vote to recommend tenure despite his personal reservations about appellant\\'s scholarship;  and the court\\'s finding that the faculty\\'s doubts anent scholarship, not Bradley\\'s vote, caused the 1981 tenure denial.  Plaintiff\\'s \"direct evidence\" construct thus collapses of its own weight.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      The remainder of Jackson\\'s merits-related asseverations, howsoever ingeniously couched, implicate the weight of the evidence, not its sufficiency or the legal infrastructure on which the decision rests.  Her remonstrances are uniformly unavailing.  The trial judge correctly understood and applied the substantive and procedural rules for probing sex discrimination in the context of academic tenure disputes.  See 721 F.Supp. at 1401-04.    The court\\'s recension of the evidence and its selection of inferences, albeit not inevitable, has the ring of utter plausibility.  While a different set of inferences could supportably have been drawn, it is not our province to second-guess the trial court\\'s \"election among conflicting facts or its choice of which competing inferences to draw....\"  Irons v. FBI, 811 F.2d at 684.    Nor does counsel\\'s eloquent presentation of Jackson\\'s case carry the day:  \"the mere repetition of arguments, in strong language and with evident feeling, is insufficient to the task [of overbearing Rule 52(a) ].\"  Reliance Steel, 880 F.2d at 577.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      In this instance, a painstaking canvass of the record intimates no hint of clear error.  Because we are not \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948), we must leave the trial court\\'s findings and conclusions undisturbed.2\\n    \\n    IV. DISCOVERY IRREGULARITIES\\n    \\n      19\\n      Appellant\\'s next assignment of error implicates the district court\\'s handling of certain discovery irregularities.  There are two prominent bones of contention:  (1) when appellant attempted to obtain access to the files of certain successful (male) tenure candidates, she found that they had been destroyed in contravention of the University\\'s rules on document retention and storage;  (2) although appellant sought production of the 1981 faculty vote tallies early on, defendants did not deliver them until the trial was nearly over, having initially represented that the records did not exist.  Jackson argues that the trial court erred in finding defendants\\' conduct merely negligent and in imposing insufficiently exacting remedies.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      We examine Jackson\\'s complaints anent discovery in the ensemble.  As to the appraisal of the University\\'s cumulative conduct as negligent, 721 F.Supp. at 1404-05, we find adequate support for the district court\\'s analysis.  While the record is not unarguable as to defendants\\' intent and degree of culpability, ambiguity and alternative inference are for trial courts to sift.  Since the finding of negligence is one of fact and falls within the range of plausibility, we cannot alter it.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. at 573-74, 105 S.Ct. at 1511-12.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      Plaintiff\\'s follow-on point is that, with Harvard\\'s misconduct revealed, the district court should have acted more decisively under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(g), 37(b), and 37(d) (collectively, empowering the court to levy sanctions for various kinds of discovery lapses).  Jackson requested the judge to draw a negative inference about the content of the destroyed files and to preclude defendants from putting the faculty votes into evidence.  The judge demurred, instead reopening the evidence and offering plaintiff a continuance, relaxation of an earlier privilege restriction, and the right to engage in further discovery.  The court eschewed the imposition of more onerous sanctions, being \"unwilling to decide this case on the basis of evidentiary constructs such as adverse inferences and preclusionary orders.\"    Id. at 1405.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      We review a choice of sanctions only for abuse of discretion.  National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639, 642, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 2780, 49 L.Ed.2d 747 (1976) (per curiam);  Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d at 393;  Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1081 (1st Cir.1990).  A district court\\'s discretion to fashion discovery orders and remedies for misconduct is broad.  See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation, 859 F.2d 1007, 1019 (1st Cir.1988) (discovery orders);  Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 923 (1st Cir.1988) (discovery misconduct).  The same breadth applies to a district court\\'s decision to impose sanctions less severe than the outermost limits of discretion would allow, or, within the purview of Rule 37 at least, not to impose sanctions at all.  See Benitez-Allende v. Alcan Aluminio do Brasil, S.A., 857 F.2d 26, 33 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 1135, 103 L.Ed.2d 196 (1989);  Craig v. Far West Eng\\'g.  Co., 265 F.2d 251, 260 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 816, 80 S.Ct. 57, 4 L.Ed.2d 63 (1959);  cf. Unanue-Casal v. Unanue-Casal, 898 F.2d 839, 841 (1st Cir.1990) (Rule 11 sanctions \"legally required\" in some cases).  Whether harsher sanctions were the best solution or whether we, if making a fresh diagnosis, might have prescribed some stronger medicine, are not determinative considerations.  See Marquis Theatre Corp. v. Condado Mini Cinema, 846 F.2d 86, 90 (1st Cir.1988).  Rather, appellate inquiry is limited to whether the trial court\\'s chosen course of action came \"safely within the universe of suitable\" alternatives.  See Fashion House, 892 F.2d at 1082.\\n    \\n    In Fashion House, we observed that:\\n    \\n      23\\n      Abuse [of discretion] occurs when a material factor deserving significant weight is ignored, when an improper factor is relied upon, or when all proper and no improper factors are assessed, but the court makes a serious mistake in weighing them.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      Id. at 1081 (quoting Independent Oil and Chemical Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir.1988)).  We find no abuse here.  The considerations relied on by the district judge were relevant.  Although Jackson disparages the court\\'s findings and the manner in which they were weighted, she identifies nothing consequential which the court overlooked.  By the same token, she points to nothing improper which the court examined.  And the balance struck does not jar our sensibilities.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      On this record, it was permissible for the court to conclude that the tardy production of records and the loss of evidence did not flow from defendants\\' consciousness that the documents would hurt their case.  Once that finding was made, the court was entitled to treat it as an important part of the calculus of relief.  See Nation-Wide Check Corp, v. Forest Hills Distributors, 692 F.2d 214, 219 (1st Cir.1982);  Allen Pen Co. v. Springfield Photo Mount Co., 653 F.2d 17, 23-24 (1st Cir.1981).  After all, where misconduct is not willful or intentional, \"there seems less reason for an adverse presumption.\"    Anderson v. Cryovac Inc., 862 F.2d at 926.    Preclusion and negative inference are grave steps, \"by no means an automatic response to a delayed disclosure ... [or] where failure to make discovery [is] not willful.\"    Freeman v. Package Machinery Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1341 (1st Cir.1988).\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      In this situation, we think it was reasonable for the judge to conclude that \"the sanction needed to be one appropriate to the truth-finding process, not one that ... served only further to suppress evidence.\"    721 F.Supp. at 1414.    The remedy devised--a continuance and an open run at further discovery--was a concinnous response to the problems created by the University\\'s negligence.  There is simply no principled way in which we can conclude that the trial court misused its broad discretion.V. CONCLUSION\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      To recapitulate, the district court\\'s finding that the tenure denial was not a result of discriminatory animus on Harvard\\'s part was not clearly wrong.  Nor did the court overstep its broad discretionary powers in dealing with irregularities occurring in the course of pretrial discovery.  Indeed, the record establishes, beyond serious question, that appellant received all the process that was due.  Her most compelling complaint seems simply that, believing herself to be in the right, she nevertheless lost her case.  Her dissatisfaction is understandable.  But the University, on the evidence adduced at trial, had an equal claim to believe that it had struck no foul blows.  Resolving which of the two disputants was entitled to prevail under applicable law in a close, fact-dominated case is precisely the sort of grist for which the trial mill was long ago devised.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      Affirmed.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         The Civil Rules provide in pertinent part:\\n        In all actions tried upon the facts without a jury ... the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon....  Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\\n        Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         Appellant complains that the district court erred by stating that \"whether or not [Jackson] ... is more qualified than tenured males ... is irrelevant in this Title VII action.\"    721 F.Supp. at 1443.  Although we question the court\\'s choice of terminology, we disagree with appellant\\'s characterization of the comment.  Taken in context, the court\\'s statement was an unmistakable reference to a settled principle:  courts do not decide whether candidates\\' tenure qualifications were judged incorrectly, but only whether the ultimate decision was based on an unlawful factor.  See Sweeney v. Bd. of Trustees of Keene State College, 604 F.2d 106, 112 (1st Cir.1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1045, 100 S.Ct. 733, 62 L.Ed.2d 731 (1980);  see also Keyes, 853 F.2d at 1026 (even if plaintiff\\'s qualifications were superior to those of successful male, that would not prove her case;  an employer\\'s mere \"[e]rrors in judgment are not the stuff of Title VII transgressions\").

(\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, 29 U.S.C. 621 et seq. (the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\")), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq. (the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\")), and N.Y. Executive Law \u00a7 296, (\"NYHRL\"), as well as a variety of state law theories including fraud, breach of contract, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Defendant Local 1199, National Health and Human Services Employees Union (\"union\"), has moved for summary judgment of these claims pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Individual defendant Steve Frankel has also moved for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.[1]\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\nThe facts, drawing all justifiable inferences in favor of the non-movant, are as follows: Plaintiff is an Hispanic woman, now in her mid-forties, who has asthma. (Complaint, \u00b6 5). She obtained a position with the defendant union in 1986 to work as an organizer. (Castro Dep., February 26, 1996, at 145). Plaintiff\\'s position required that she work both indoors and outdoors. (Castro Dep., February 27, 1996 at 143). Plaintiff spent a majority of her time indoors working at her desk or attending meetings. (Id. at 130-31). As necessary, plaintiff also occasionally led picket lines outdoors. (Id. at 142). Plaintiff\\'s doctor advised her to avoid extreme temperatures because it aggravated her asthma symptoms. (Complaint, at \u00b6 54-55). This was the only restriction that plaintiff was required to observe that limited her employment. (Castro Dep., February 27, at 141-42). In her deposition, plaintiff stated, \"I was willing and capable of performing my duties. The only accommodation that I got \\x97 I wanted was that in extreme cold or heat, that I was not to be standing outside in the cold.\" (Id.).\\nPlaintiff\\'s relationship with her employer became strained early on in her employment. (Harris Aff., at 5.) The record is replete with documentation of the various conflicts that arose between plaintiff and the union. (Defendants\\' Exhibits E-G). Most of the friction between plaintiff and the defendants resulted from her excessive absenteeism. (Defendants\\' Exhibits B-G). Plaintiff argues that her absences were largely attributable to symptoms resulting from her asthma. Defendants contend, and offer documentation, that plaintiff gave a wide variety of excuses for her absences, of which asthma was not the predominant reason; this documentation includes plaintiff\\'s own memos addressed to upper management regarding her absences in which she offers excuses such as leg pain, back pain, chest pain, stomach pain, gynecological problems, etc. (Defendants\\' Exhibits B-H). Because her absences had become so frequent, in January 1992, plaintiff agreed to allow the Union to deduct money from her paycheck to make up for the excess. (Harris Aff., at 6).\\nThe first instance plaintiff sets forth as evidence of racial discrimination occurred in December, 1993. At that time, an anonymous sender placed a photograph of plaintiff and the Reverend Jesse Jackson in plaintiff\\'s mailbox at work; the words \"you are just a white token\" appeared scrawled across the picture. (Complaint, \u00b6 64).\\n*722 On January 10, 1994, plaintiff went on an extended disability leave due to her asthma symptoms. (Id. at \u00b6 20). When she returned on April 4, 1994, plaintiff claims that the union refused to allow her to resume her usual position as an organizer and that this was an act fueled by the Union\\'s discrimination against her on a host of bases. (Id. at \u00b6 22). On April 8, 1994, at a routine meeting, plaintiff asked her supervisor, Patricia Harris, why she was not assigned to her usual responsibilities. (Castro Dep., August 7, 1995, at 79). Plaintiff claims that Harris was unresponsive to her concerns and that defendant Steve Frankel became upset with plaintiff at this meeting and threatened her.[2] (Id. at 90).\\nPlaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on April 13, 1994 on the basis of national origin, age, and disability and then went on disability leave again from April 14, 1994 until May 9, 1994. (Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 25-30). Following her return from disability leave, plaintiff claims that she was subject to treatment as a \"pariah\" and suffered complete ostracism by the union and its agents. (Id. at \u00b6 31). Following the filing of her EEOC complaint, plaintiff claims that the defendants made disparaging comments in her presence about age and race. Plaintiff asserts that while in her presence, the defendants commented that the union needed \"young blood\" and that this is evidence of age discrimination. (Complaint, \u00b6 65). In addition, plaintiff claims that her supervisor, defendant Harris, asked plaintiff on a number of occasions to refrain from speaking Spanish in front of non-Spanish speaking employees and that this is evidence of racial discrimination. (Castro Dep., March 25, 1996, at 63).\\nThe tension between plaintiff and the union continued to escalate until June, 1995 when her elected term expired,[3] and the union terminated her employment at that time. (Castro Dep., February 27, 1996, at 162). Following her dismissal by the Union, plaintiff filed suit with this court alleging employment discrimination based on a host of theories which I address below.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nI. Summary Judgment Standard\\n\\n\"A motion for summary judgment may not be granted unless the court determines that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried and that the facts as to which there is no such issue warrant judgment for the moving party as a matter of law.\" Chambers v. TRM Copy Centers Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 36 (2d Cir.1994); see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). See generally Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). An issue of fact is genuine when \"a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,\" and facts are material to the outcome of the particular litigation if the substantive law at issue so renders them. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S. Ct. at 2510.\\nThe burden of establishing that no genuine factual dispute exists rests on the party seeking summary judgment. Chambers, 43 F.3d at 36. \"In moving for summary judgment against a party who will bear the ultimate burden of proof at trial,\" however, \"the movant\\'s burden will be satisfied if he can point to an absence of evidence to support an essential element of the nonmoving party\\'s claim.\" Goenaga v. March of Dimes Birth Defects Found., 51 F.3d 14, 18 (2d Cir.1995); accord Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. Partnership, 22 F.3d 1219, 1223-24 (2d Cir.1994) (\"[T]he moving party may *723 obtain summary judgment by showing that little or no evidence may be found in support of the nonmoving party\\'s case.\"). The moving party, in other words, does not bear the burden of disproving an essential element of the nonmoving party\\'s claim.\\nIf the moving party meets its burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to come forward with \"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e); accord Rexnord Holdings, Inc. v. Bidermann, 21 F.3d 522, 525-26 (2d Cir.1994). The nonmoving party must \"do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586, 106 S. Ct. at 1356. Instead, the nonmovant must \"`come forward with enough evidence to support a jury verdict in its favor, and the motion will not be defeated merely ... on the basis of conjecture or surmise.\\'\" Trans Sport v. Starter Sportswear, 964 F.2d 186, 188 (2d Cir.1992) (citation omitted).\\nIn assessing materials such as affidavits, exhibits, interrogatory answers, and depositions to determine whether the moving party has satisfied its burden, the court must view the record \"in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion\" by resolving \"all ambiguities and draw[ing] all factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\" Chambers, 43 F.3d at 36. \"If, as to the issue on which summary judgment is sought, there is any evidence in the record from any source from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the moving party, summary judgment is improper.\" Id. at 37 (emphasis added).\\n\\nII. ADA Claim\\n\\nIn order to state a claim under the ADA, the plaintiff must adequately allege that she suffers from a \"disability.\" Under the statute, a \"disability\" consists of:\\n(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual;\\n(B) a record of such impairment; or\\n(C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2) (1995). The determination of whether a particular impairment constitutes a disability must be made on a case-by-case basis. See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App. \u00a7 1630.2(j). (\"The determination of whether an individual has a disability is ... based ... on the effect of that impairment on the life of the individual. Some impairments may be disabling for particular individuals but not for others....\").\\nThe requirement of individualized analysis is particularly appropriate in the context of disability claims relating to asthma. As of 1990, over ten million Americans have been diagnosed with asthma. United States v. Sherman, 53 F.3d 782, 787 (7th Cir.1995) (citing National Institute of Health, \"CTS About Asthma,\" Oct. 1990). The severity of asthma varies a great deal among individuals. Id. Symptoms may fall anywhere along the spectrum from mild to life-threatening, and the frequency of asthmatic episodes also varies greatly from person to person. Id. With proper treatment, however, asthmatic symptoms can almost always be controlled. Id. Thus, individualized inquiries are especially useful when determining whether asthma constitutes a disability under the ADA.\\nAs a general matter, courts consider three factors when determining whether a plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a disability under the objective prong of the definition: \"whether the plaintiff\\'s condition is a physical or mental impairment; (2) whether the impairment affects a major life activity; and (3) whether the major life activity is substantially limited by the impairment.\" Cerrato v. Durham, 941 F. Supp. 388, 391-92 (S.D.N.Y.1996); Pacourek v. Inland Steel Co., 858 F. Supp. 1393, 1404 (N.D.Ill.1994). According to the regulations accompanying the ADA, a physical or mental impairment is a physiological disorder or condition which affects one or more of a listed group of body systems. Regulations to Implement Equal Employment Provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1603.2(h)(1) (1996). Asthma is a physiological disorder or condition that affects *724 the respiratory system.[4]Heilweil v. Mount Sinai Hosp., 32 F.3d 718, 723 (2d Cir.1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1147, 115 S. Ct. 1095, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1063 (1995). Major life activities include \"functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\" 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i). Plaintiff claims that her asthma affects her ability to breathe.\\nMany courts addressing the issue, however, have found that asthma does not substantially limit the particular plaintiff\\'s ability to work or breathe and therefore does not constitute a disability under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act.[5]See Ventura v. City of Independence, 1997 WL 94688, 1997 U.S.App. Lexis 4102, at *7 (6th Cir.1997) (finding that plaintiff, an asthmatic, was not disabled under the ADA where he was able to engage in a number of activities including occasional running, football, calisthenics, playing the saxophone, and water-skiing, that belied his claim that his ability to breathe and work were significantly restricted); Gaddy v. Four B Corp., 953 F. Supp. 331, 331-32, 337-38 (D.Kan.1997) (finding that plaintiff, a sixteen-year-old girl, who, after being diagnosed as an asthmatic, was able to play volleyball in gym class and perform as a cheerleader, was not disabled under the ADA because her ability to breathe was not substantially limited); Emery v. Caravan of Dreams, 879 F. Supp. 640, 642, 645 (N.D.Tex.1995) (finding that plaintiff, an asthmatic, was not disabled under the ADA where she was able to lead a \"normal life\" that included working continuously as a flight attendant and engaging in activities such as rollerblading).\\nThe leading case in this Circuit on this issue is Heilweil v. Mount Sinai Hospital, which falls under the Rehabilitation Act. 32 F.3d 718 (2d Cir.1994). Heilweil involved a plaintiff who, subsequent to being diagnosed as an asthmatic, was hired by Mount Sinai hospital to work as a manager. Id. at 719. Two years later, her employer transferred her to the hospital\\'s blood bank. Id. at 720. Plaintiff\\'s asthma symptoms worsened after her transfer to the blood bank, and her physician told her that the air quality at the facility was the principal cause of her ailments and advised her to stay away from the facility. Id. After discussing her concerns with her immediate supervisor, both parties agreed that due to her physical reaction to the environment at the blood bank, plaintiff could no longer work there on a regular basis. Id. Her supervisor informed plaintiff that another individual would take over plaintiff\\'s responsibilities, and plaintiff agreed to continue to work and to refrain from seeking other employment until the transition was complete. Id. For the next several months, plaintiff never entered the blood bank and administered it from the outside. Id. Plaintiff maintained that her health improved and attributed the improvement to the change in her work routine. Id. When plaintiff refused to continue to cooperate in facilitating the transition, the hospital terminated her; in response, she filed suit against her former employer under the Rehabilitation Act. Id. at 720-21. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\\'s finding that Heilweil was not a handicapped person within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. Id. at 721. The court reasoned that because plaintiff\\'s respiratory *725 problems were exacerbated only when she worked in the blood bank, her medical condition did not substantially limit one or more of her life activities. Id. In making this determination, the court relied on plaintiff\\'s statement that she felt \"fine now that I haven\\'t been in the blood bank for several months\" and that after leaving the blood bank, she was able to exercise regularly. Id.\\nHeilweil leads me to conclude that to qualify as a disability, the \"employee\\'s impairment must limit her employment generally.\" Heilweil, 32 F.3d at 719. Furthermore, if a plaintiff\\'s claimed disability disqualifies her from only a narrow range of jobs, then it is not a substantially limiting one. Id. at 723. In the present case, plaintiff must show that her asthma substantially limits her ability to breathe, which has the overall effect of restricting her employment opportunities generally. Plaintiff has not met this burden. In her deposition, plaintiff stated that her asthma restricts only her ability to go outside in extreme temperatures, and that either extreme humidity, extreme cold, or strong winds can trigger an asthma attack. (Castro Dep., February 27, 1996, at 130). Even accepting her statements as true, plaintiff\\'s testimony fails to demonstrate that her asthma substantially limits her ability to breathe or that her status as an asthmatic restricted her employment opportunities generally. Plaintiff\\'s job as an organizer required that she spend the bulk of her time engaged in indoor activities such as negotiating contracts, educating union members, and attending various meetings. (Id.). In addition, plaintiff\\'s responsibilities under her job title required that she occasionally work outdoors in order to supervise picket lines. (Id. at 142). The only accommodation that plaintiff requested when she had to work outdoors in extreme temperatures was a location in which to warm up or cool down periodically for a few minutes at a time. (Id. at 144). Thus, for the bulk of her time, plaintiff was not required to work in extreme temperatures and, if the occasion required she do so, she was able to manage. As a result, I find that plaintiff\\'s physical impairment did not substantially limit her ability to breathe, and similarly, her asthma did not limit her employment opportunities generally; rather, it only restricted plaintiff\\'s work capabilities in the narrowest sense. Far from being inhibited in her ability to work generally, plaintiff\\'s difficulties arose only in regard to a single aspect of a single position. Courts have held that such a minimal limitation does not rise to the level of a disability under the ADA. See Wernick v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 91 F.3d 379, 383-84 (2d Cir.1996) (stating, in dicta, that plaintiff was not disabled where her back injury only limited her ability to perform a single job within the corporation); Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723, 726-27 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that the plaintiff\\'s inability to perform a narrow range of jobs does not qualify her as having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity); Gupton v. Virginia, 14 F.3d 203, 205 (4th Cir.) (commenting that the plaintiff was required to show not just that her impairment incapacitated her for a particular job, but more broadly, for the type of employment involved), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 810, 115 S. Ct. 59, 130 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1994); Byrne v. Board of Educ., 979 F.2d 560, 565 (7th Cir.1992) (stating that \"[i]t is well established that the inability to perform a particular job for a particular employer is not sufficient to establish a handicap; the impairment must substantially limit employment generally\"); Jasany v. United States Postal Serv., 755 F.2d 1244, 1249 n. 3 (6th Cir.1985) (commenting that \"[a]n impairment that affects only a narrow range of jobs can be regarded either as not reaching a major life activity or as not substantially limiting one\"). Therefore, I find that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that she is disabled under the ADA, and summary judgment is granted in favor of defendants on this issue.\\n\\nIII. ADEA Claim\\n\\nIn addition to being discriminated against based on her asthma, plaintiff also claims that she was discriminated against because of her age. Plaintiff offers three indications of age discrimination by the defendant union and its agents: a comment made by upper management that she overheard that \"young blood\" was needed at the union, a union doctor\\'s comment that asthma worsens with *726 age, and the fact that plaintiff was replaced by a younger individual.\\nCongress enacted 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621(b) to \"promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age\" and to \"prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621(b). The New York Human Rights Law embraces similar goals; consequently, the analysis of a plaintiff\\'s age discrimination claim under the New York statute is identical to that under the ADEA. Ritter v. Medical Arts Center Hosp., 1997 WL 45349, at *3, (S.D.N.Y.1997); Boyle v. McCann-Erickson, Inc., 949 F. Supp. 1095, 1099 n. 4 (S.D.N.Y.1997).\\nA plaintiff alleging discrimination under the ADEA has the burden of showing that her age was a determinative factor in the employment decision. Boyle, 949 F.Supp. at 1099. To establish a prima facie case under the ADEA, the plaintiff must show that (1) she is in the protected age group, (2) she is qualified for the job, (3) she was discharged, and (4) the discharge occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of age discrimination. Id.; see also Maresco v. Evans Chemetics, 964 F.2d 106, 110 (2d Cir. 1992). If the plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case under the ADEA, the burden then shifts to the defendant to state a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge. Boyle, 949 F.Supp. at 1100. If the defendant is able to meet this burden, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer\\'s reason is a pretext. Id.\\nIn the present case, plaintiff is a member of the protected class. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 631(a) (stating that the class consists of individuals who are at least forty years old). Plaintiff also established that she was discharged. Plaintiff has not, however, offered any evidence that she was qualified for the job aside from her own testimony. Furthermore, even if I were to find that plaintiff has showed that she possessed the requisite qualifications for the job, she has not established that her discharge occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of age discrimination. The allegedly ageist comments that plaintiff claims were made by the defendants must be scrutinized to determine if they are in fact ageist statements or merely statements indicating something connected to age but not discriminatory. Id. at 1101. Courts have found that comments directed at employees such as \"old ladies with balls,\" \"young turks,\" and \"it sometimes is difficult to teach an old dog new tricks\" were not relevant to the inquiry into whether the employee experienced discrimination based on her age. Id.; see also Haskell v. Kaman Corp., 743 F.2d 113, 120 (2d Cir.1984); Getschmann v. James River Paper Co., 822 F. Supp. 75, 78 (D.Conn.1993), aff\\'d, 7 F.3d 221 (2d Cir.1993). The comments plaintiff asserts are evidence of age discrimination \\x97 upper management\\'s statement that the union needed \"young blood\" and the union doctor\\'s comment that asthma worsens with age \\x97 are of the same magnitude and cannot be considered to be discriminatory. Significantly, the comments were not expressly directed at plaintiff, which she would need to show in order to establish that such remarks were discriminatory. See Boyle, 949 F.Supp. at 1102.\\nMoreover, courts have held that stray remarks in the workplace, by themselves, will not defeat the employer\\'s motion for summary judgment. See, e.g., Bern v. United Mercantile Agencies, 942 F. Supp. 217, 220 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (stating that \"[e]ven if [the] stray comments could somehow be said to demonstrate some evidence of age bias, they are plainly too immaterial to withstand a properly supported motion for summary judgment\").\\nThe only other evidence that plaintiff has adduced on this issue is the fact that she was replaced by a younger individual, a woman in her mid-thirties. The defendants have produced statistical data relating to the ages of employees currently holding the position of organizer in the union: 65% of the staff holding such positions are over the age of forty, the majority of whom are in plaintiff\\'s age range of forty to fifty years old. (Weekes Aff., at 3). Plaintiff does not contest this data. Accordingly, I find that plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under either the ADEA or under NYHRL. Defendants\\' motion for summary judgement is granted as to plaintiff\\'s *727 federal and state age discrimination claims.\\n\\nIV. Remaining Discrimination Claims\\n\\nIn addition to claiming that she has suffered discrimination because of her asthma and age, plaintiff claims that the defendants discriminated against her based on her race and national origin. Plaintiff alleges that this discrimination escalated upon her return from an extended disability leave in early April, 1994. Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC in mid-April 1994, and claims that in response, the defendants retaliated against her by denying her the opportunity to exercise the full scope of her responsibilities and ultimately terminating her and subjecting her to a hostile work environment. Plaintiff has failed to come forward with evidence to counter defendants\\' proffer on summary judgment. Plaintiff\\'s sole evidence on these claims consists of her deposition testimony; plaintiff\\'s testimony conclusively demonstrates, however, that she did not suffer any legally redressable injury.\\n\\nA. Hostile Work Environment Pursuant to Title VII\\nUnder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964[6], an employer may not \"discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\\'s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). To state a claim for a hostile work environment under Title VII, the plaintiff must demonstrate that her \"workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,\" Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993) (citing Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2404-05, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986)), so as to \"alter the conditions of the victim\\'s employment and create an abusive working environment.\" Id. The inquiry has both objective and subjective components. To satisfy the objective prong of the analysis, the conduct must be offensive or pervasive enough to create an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive. Id. Similarly, the victim must actually perceive her employment environment as abusive. Id. The determination of whether conduct rises to the level of creating a hostile work environment, and thus violates Title VII, rests upon an examination of the totality of the circumstances. Kotcher v. Rosa and Sullivan Appliance Center, Inc., 957 F.2d 59, 63 (1992); Snell v. Suffolk County, 782 F.2d 1094, 1103 (2d Cir.1986); Babcock v. Frank, 783 F. Supp. 800, 808 (S.D.N.Y.1992); Galvez v. Means, 1996 WL 487962, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).\\nPlaintiff argues that the following incidents created a racially and ethnically hostile work environment. First, plaintiff claims that in December, 1993, a photograph of the plaintiff and Reverend Jesse Jackson was placed in her mailbox at work by an anonymous sender; the words \"you are just a white token\" appeared scrawled across the picture. Plaintiff, a fair-skinned Hispanic woman, claims that this is evidence of race discrimination. The mere utterance of an epithet which the employee considers offensive, however, is not sufficient to alter the conditions of her employment so as to violate Title VII. Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S. Ct. at 370. Second, plaintiff claims that defendant Harris, plaintiff\\'s supervisor, manifested an obvious dislike of Hispanics, as illustrated by Harris\\'s requests that plaintiff refrain from speaking Spanish when non-Spanish speaking employees of the union were present. Such a conclusory allegation of discrimination, however, does not allow a party to defeat summary judgment. Meiri v. Dacon, 759 F.2d 989, 998 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 829, 106 S. Ct. 91, 88 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1985).\\nStanding alone, these isolated incidents cannot sustain a claim of discrimination under Title VII. See Snell, 782 F.2d at 1102 (stating that a few isolated instances of racial enmity do not give rise to a Title VII violation); Babcock, 783 F.Supp. at 808 (finding *728 no hostile work environment where the claimed incidents were few in number and occurred over a short period of time); Picotte v. Community Child Care Center of the Third Ward, Inc., 901 F. Supp. 588, 594 (W.D.N.Y.1995) (finding that no hostile work environment existed where the racial comments made were few in number and were not directed at the plaintiff personally); Lawson v. Getty Terminals Corp., 866 F. Supp. 793, 802 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (stating that, although deplorable, the racial epithets aimed at the plaintiff did not give rise to a violation under Title VII because they were isolated remarks); Bennett v. New York City Dept. of Corrections, 705 F. Supp. 979, 982 (S.D.N.Y.1989) (indicating that a plaintiff must demonstrate more than a few isolated instances of racial friction in order to sustain a discrimination claim under a hostile environment theory). To sustain a Title VII claim under a hostile work environment theory, plaintiff must present evidence of racially vicious epithets, physically threatening or humiliating actions, or a pattern of such reprehensible behavior over an extended period of time. Kotcher v. Rosa and Sullivan Appliance Center, 957 F.2d 59, 63 (2d Cir.1992) (holding that a store manager created a hostile work environment where he pretended to masturbate and ejaculate behind plaintiff\\'s back to express his anger at her, and the conduct took place on a regular basis, and often occurred in front of customers); Currie v. Kowalewski, 842 F. Supp. 57 (N.D.N.Y.) (finding a hostile environment where employer subjected plaintiff to continued sexual advances over an eleven month period), aff\\'d, 40 F.3d 1236 (2d Cir.1994); Amirmokri v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 60 F.3d 1126, 1131-32 (4th Cir.1995) (holding that a Title VII claim was properly sustained where, for six months, plaintiff was subjected to daily \"national origin\" epithets and name-calling, and was asked to perform objectively impossible tasks); Gary v. Long, 59 F.3d 1391, 1397 (D.C.Cir.) (finding that, in a sex harassment case, repeated verbal and physical harassment culminating in rape, was sufficient to state a claim under a hostile work environment theory), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S. Ct. 569, 133 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1995). In the absence of proof of additional instances of such offensive conduct, I find that plaintiff has failed to raise an issue of fact requiring trial on her Title VII claim under the theory of hostile work environment.\\n\\nB. Hostile Work Environment Pursuant to N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296\\nUnlike its federal counterpart, section 296 of the New York Executive Law permits a plaintiff to sue an individual defendant in her own personal capacity for creating a hostile work environment in certain circumstances.[7]Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295, 1317 (2d Cir.1995); Ritter v. Medical Arts Center Hosp., 1997 WL 45349 (S.D.N.Y.). The standard for establishing liability against either the union or the individual defendants under NYHRL is the same as under Title VII. Id.; see also Van Zant v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, 80 F.3d 708, 714-15 (2d Cir.1996). Thus, because I have already determined the incidents alleged by the plaintiff were neither so pervasive nor severe to create a hostile work environment under Title VII, summary judgment for the individual defendants on this claim is also granted.\\n\\nC. Retaliation under Title VII and N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296\\nBecause plaintiff\\'s retaliation claims under Title VII and N.Y. Exec. Law against the defendant union are governed by the same standard, I address them simultaneously. Reed v. A.W. Lawrence &amp; Co., Inc., 95 F.3d 1170, 1177 (2d Cir.1996) (stating that state law and Title VII claims are considered in tandem \"because New York courts rely on federal law when determining claims under\" the state human rights law which is covered by N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 290 et seq.); Yukoweic v. Intern. Bus. Machines, 643 N.Y.S.2d 747, 748 n. 1 (3d Dep\\'t), leave to appeal denied, 88 N.Y.2d 816, 651 N.Y.S.2d 17, 673 N.E.2d *729 1244 (1996) (\"New York courts require the same standard of proof in actions brought pursuant to Executive Law \u00a7 296 as that applied to federal actions brought under Title VII ...\").\\nTo prevail on her retaliation claim, the plaintiff must show that (1) she was engaged in a protected activity under Title VII, (2) that her employer was aware of this activity, (3) that her employer took adverse action against the plaintiff, and (4) that a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action. Sumner v. United States Postal Service, 899 F.2d 203, 208-09 (2d Cir.1990); Babcock, 783 F.Supp. at 807. In the present case, plaintiff filed a complaint with the EEOC, which is a protected activity, and it is undisputed that the defendants were aware of the complaint; thus, she has satisfied the first and second elements.\\nPlaintiff has failed, however, to prove the remaining elements necessary to sustain her retaliation claim. With respect to the third element, whether an employer\\'s conduct constitutes an adverse action, the plaintiff must show that the conduct \"affected the terms, privileges, duration, or conditions of [her] employment.\" Dortz v. City of New York, 904 F. Supp. 127, 155 (S.D.N.Y. 1995); Vergara v. Bentsen, 868 F. Supp. 581, 591 (S.D.N.Y.1994). The conduct plaintiff alleges to constitute adverse employment actions do not satisfy this standard. For example, plaintiff claims that the union \"forced\" her to walk two-and-a-half miles in the heat to lead an employee demonstration. (Complaint, \u00b6 32). Such an activity was part of her job description, however. Thus, because plaintiff\\'s position required that she lead demonstrations in all types of weather, it cannot be said that performing this duty affected the terms, privileges, duration or conditions of her employment. Plaintiff also asserts that the union\\'s refusal to grant her additional sick days over the summer of 1994 was in furtherance of the union\\'s \"mission of retaliation\" against her. (Complaint, \u00b6 43). Because the record establishes that the plaintiff was excessively absent from work, it cannot be said that the union\\'s refusal to grant the plaintiff additional sick days was unreasonable.\\nThe only action that the union took against plaintiff that may be construed as adverse is their decision to terminate her employment when her elected term expired. Even assuming this action was adverse, plaintiff has not demonstrated a causal connection between her dismissal and her filing of her EEOC complaint. A causal connection may be established by showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse action. Reed v. Lawrence &amp; Co., Inc., 95 F.3d 1170, 1178 (2d Cir.1996). Plaintiff was fired in June, 1995, over a year after she had filed a complaint with the EEOC. Courts have found that a lapse in time of this magnitude is insufficient to establish a causal connection. See Zenni v. Hard Rock Cafe Int\\'l Inc., 903 F. Supp. 644, 656 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (holding that plaintiff failed to establish a causal connection where \"a full year passed between the filing of the charge and the allegation of retaliatory conduct\"); see also Hollander v. American Cyanamid Co., 895 F.2d 80, 84-85 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding that plaintiff failed to establish causation where three-and-a-half months passed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action); Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 828 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that plaintiff failed to show retaliation when almost nine months had passed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985, 112 S. Ct. 2965, 119 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1992). Therefore, because plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of retaliation, defendants\\' motion for summary judgment on this issue is granted.\\n\\nD. Section 1981 Claim\\nSection 1981 applies solely to racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts. See Saint Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 107 S. Ct. 2022, 95 L. Ed. 2d 582 (1987) (stating that \"[a]lthough \u00a7 1981 does not itself use the word `race,\\' the Court has construed this section to forbid all `racial\\' discrimination in the making of private contracts\"). In this Circuit, courts have applied the protections *730 of section 1981 to persons of Puerto Rican or other Hispanic origin. Lopez v. S.B. Thomas, Inc., 831 F.2d 1184, 1188 (2d Cir.1987); Hernandez v. New York City Law Dept. Corp. Counsel, 1997 WL 27047 (S.D.N.Y.); Cruz v. Ecolab Pest Elimination Div., Ecolab Inc., 817 F. Supp. 388 (S.D.N.Y.1993).\\nTo establish a claim under section 1981, the plaintiff must demonstrate (1) that she is a member of a racial minority, (2) an intent to discriminate on the basis of race by the defendant, and (3) that the discrimination interfered with one of the activities enumerated in \u00a7 1981, which includes her ability to make and enforce contracts.[8]Mian v. Donaldson, 7 F.3d 1085, 1087 (2d Cir.1993), aff\\'d, 60 F.3d 810 (2d. Cir.1995), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S. Ct. 88, 133 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1995). Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated the first element; she is undisputedly of Puerto Rican origin. Plaintiff has failed, however, to satisfy the second element, as she has not demonstrated that the defendants\\' decision to terminate her was intentionally discriminatory. Defendants have produced extensive evidence proving that plaintiff\\'s termination came about because she was excessively absent, unreliable, and insubordinate. Because plaintiff has failed to come forward with any evidence to rebut defendants\\' myriad of legitimate reasons for firing her, I find that plaintiff has failed to proffer evidence from which a factfinder could infer that her dismissal was based on the defendants\\' discrimination against her because of her race. Defendants\\' motion for summary judgment is granted as to plaintiff\\'s section 1981 claims.\\n\\nE. State Law Claims\\nIn addition to her federal and state statutory claims, plaintiff has brought a variety of state common law causes of action. Some of these claims address alleged wrongdoing by all the defendants while other claims are directed solely at a particular defendant. As discussed in more detail below, each of plaintiff\\'s claims under New York state common law suffers from a substantive fatal flaw.\\n\\n1. Breach of Contract\\nPlaintiff argues that by failing to follow its antidiscriminatory policy contained in its employee manual and Constitution, the union breached its contractual obligation to plaintiff. Plaintiff\\'s claim in this regard is clearly deficient.\\nIn the State of New York, in the absence of an agreement establishing a fixed duration, an employment relationship is presumed to be a hiring at will. De Petris v. Union Settlement Assoc., Inc., 86 N.Y.2d 406, 633 N.Y.S.2d 274, 276, 657 N.E.2d 269, 271 (1995); Weiner v. McGraw-Hill, Inc., 57 N.Y.2d 458, 457 N.Y.S.2d 193, 195-96, 443 N.E.2d 441 (1982); Tucker v. Battery Park City Parks Corp., 642 N.Y.S.2d 891, 892 (1996); Kelley v. New York State Martin Luther King Jr. Commission and Inst. for Nonviolence, 229 A.D.2d 629, ___, 644 N.Y.S.2d 862, 863 (1996) (noting that it is \"well-settled that ... an employment relationship is presumed to be a hiring at will....\"). Either party in an at-will employment relationship may terminate the relationship at any time. De Petris, 633 N.Y.S.2d at 276, 657 N.E.2d at 271. Moreover, New York law does not recognize a tort of wrongful discharge or require good faith in an at-will employment relationship. Id. The at-will presumption may be rebutted, however, if the employee is able to show two things: (1) that the employer made the employee aware of an express written policy limiting its right of discharge, and (2) that the employee detrimentally relied on that policy in accepting the employment. Id. The New York Court of Appeals has indicated that the \"[m]ere existence of a written policy ... does not limit an employer\\'s right to discharge an at-will employee, or give rise to a legally enforceable claim by the employee against the employer.\" De Petris, 633 N.Y.S.2d at 276, 657 N.E.2d at 271.\\nPlaintiff has failed to satisfy either of these criteria. First, plaintiff concedes that the personnel manual was not distributed *731 to employees until 1989-90, and that once she received a copy, she automatically put it in her drawer at work without looking at it. (Castro Dep., February 26, 1996, at 214-15). Therefore, plaintiff could not have relied on the policies enumerated in a document that did not exist at the time she accepted employment with the union. Moreover, by admitting that she had not read any provisions of the manual until her supervisors began \"picking on\" her, plaintiff indicates that she in no way detrimentally relied on the employment manual. (Castro Dep., February 26, 1996, at 215).\\nThe union constitution that took effect the year before plaintiff began to work for the union does not create an employment contract. Doyle v. Turner, 1993 WL 183788, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.). The constitution governs the relationship between members of the union and the union rather than the union\\'s relationship with its employees. (Defendant\\'s Exhibit A; Local 1199 constitution). Thus, where the claims focus exclusively on the employer-employee relationship, the union is merely a regular employer with the same rights and privileges as any other employer. Doyle, at *3. The union constitution, therefore, serves plaintiff neither as a sword nor a shield. Id.\\nEven if I were to find that the constitution created a contract, plaintiff\\'s claim would fail. Plaintiff\\'s core contention on this issue is that the union president may not terminate an elected organizer. (Defendant\\'s Exhibit A). The unrebutted evidence shows, however, that the union fired the plaintiff after her elected term expired. Therefore, even if the union constitution comprised a contractual obligation, no breach of that obligation occurred. Defendants\\' motion for summary judgment is granted as to plaintiff\\'s breach of contract claim.\\n\\n2. Fraud Claim\\nPlaintiff\\'s fraud claim arises out of events surrounding a union election. Plaintiff claims that defendants lied about the results of the election in order to prevent her from retaining her elected position with the union.\\nTo establish a claim for fraud under New York law, the plaintiff must demonstrate the following elements: (1) that the defendant made a material false representation, (2) that the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff with such representation, (3) that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representation, and (4) that the plaintiff suffered damage as a result of such reliance. Keywell Corp. v. Weinstein, 33 F.3d 159, 163 (2d Cir.1994). The facts elicited in the course of plaintiff\\'s testimony, even if presumed true, do not state a claim for fraud. Plaintiff has not shown that she relied on the \"false\" election results to her detriment. Furthermore, plaintiff has not produced any evidence beyond her own assertions to support her claim that a misrepresentation was in fact made to rebut the convincing evidence offered by the defendants that the election results were legitimate. (Harris Aff., at 13-15).\\n\\n3. Assault Claim Against Individual Defendant Steve Frankel\\nPlaintiff\\'s assault claim against Frankel arises out of events that allegedly took place at a routine meeting on Friday, April 8, 1994. (Castro Dep., August 7, 1995, at 76). Those attending the meeting were defendant Frankel, plaintiff\\'s supervisor, Patricia Harris, and four other union employees. (Id. at 78). Plaintiff had returned from an extended disability leave that Monday and had not received her usual assignment. (Id.). When plaintiff questioned Harris about this matter at the meeting, Harris was unresponsive. (Id.). Harris then assigned plaintiff to assist another organizer in preparing for an arbitration, an assignment which plaintiff found to be unsatisfactory. (Id. at 80.). Plaintiff became upset at this point and pleaded with her supervisor to \"level\" with her and tell her \"what the hell was going on.\" (Id.).\\nAt this point, plaintiff claims that Steve Frankel, screamed, \"You know something, if I was you, I would take whatever assignment they give me and that\\'s it.\" (Id. at 81-82). When plaintiff asked Frankel what he meant, Frankel slammed his hand on the table again and responded, \"If I was you, I would take whatever they give me, because you could *732 lose more than your job.\" (Id. at 82). Plaintiff claims that Frankel was visibly angry during the course of the exchange as he was \"red in the face,\" slamming the table, and \"coming at\" her by wheeling his chair closer and closer to her. (Id. at 82-83, 93, 115). Plaintiff implored Frankel to clarify his statement by asking, \"What do you mean I could lose more than my job? Are you threatening my life?\" (Id.). Frankel then stated, \"Take it any way you want.\" Plaintiff gathered her things and stated, \"Well, it seems, Pat, you\\'re not going to give me an assignment. It seems I am amongst enemies here,\" and left the meeting. (Id. at 82-83).\\nUnder New York law, assault is the intentional placing of another person in apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. United National Ins., Co. v. Waterfront New York Realty Corp., 994 F.2d 105, 108 (2d Cir.1993); Cohen v. Davis, 926 F. Supp. 399, 402 (S.D.N.Y.1996); Hayes v. Schultz, 150 A.D.2d 522, 541 N.Y.S.2d 115, 116 (2d Dep\\'t 1989). With respect to verbal threats, \"words not accompanied by circumstances inducing a reasonable apprehension of bodily harm, such as movements of drawing back a fist, aiming a blow, or the show of a weapon, do not constitute an assault.\" Williams v. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 880 F. Supp. 980, 994 (E.D.N.Y. 1995). The facts of Williams are similar to the present case. In Williams, the plaintiff, an employee of defendant Port Authority, was called into his supervisor\\'s office where his supervisor reprimanded him. Id. Once inside the office, the plaintiff claimed that the supervisor used a racial slur, backed him against the wall, and threatened to \"get him.\" Id. The Williams court dismissed the complaint finding that no assault occurred because the supervisor\\'s threat was \"forward-looking,\" and not of such nature as to lead the plaintiff to believe that his supervisor was going to strike him at or near that point in time. Id.\\nSimilarly, in the present case, the actions that plaintiff asserts constitute an assault \\x97 plaintiff\\'s interpretation of Frankel\\'s remarks as a threat, Frankel \"slamming\" the table with his hand and moving his chair closer to plaintiff during the course of the exchange \\x97 were \"forward-looking\" and were not accompanied by gestures that would cause plaintiff to reasonably believe that she was in danger of imminent bodily harm. Furthermore, plaintiff\\'s own admission indicates that her apprehension of bodily harm was not imminent.[9] Accordingly, defendant Frankel\\'s motion for summary judgment is granted as to plaintiff\\'s assault claim.\\n\\n4. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claim\\nUnder New York law, in order to establish a claim for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must demonstrate four elements: (1) that the defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct, (2) that the defendant intended to cause severe emotional distress, (3) that the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress, and (4) that the defendant\\'s conduct caused the plaintiff severe emotional distress. Bender v. New York, 78 F.3d 787, 790 (2d Cir.1996); Ward v. Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., 1996 WL 3930 (S.D.N.Y.1996); Howell v. New York Post Co., 81 N.Y.2d 115, 121, 596 N.Y.S.2d 350, 612 N.E.2d 699 (1993). New York courts have imposed a very high threshold for intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, requiring that \"the conduct must be so outrageous and extreme as to go beyond all possible [b]ounds of decency.\" Bender, 78 F.3d at 790; Fischer v. Maloney, 43 N.Y.2d 553, 557, 402 N.Y.S.2d 991, 373 N.E.2d 1215 (1978). For example, a New York appellate court found that, in a case of alleged employee harassment, the allegation of a \"hard slap on [plaintiff\\'s] backside\" during an outburst of rage by the individual defendant, although meeting the criteria necessary to sustain a claim of assault and battery, fell short of the rigorous standard of outrageous conduct necessary to maintain a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Jaffe v. National League for Nursing, 222 *733 A.D.2d 233, 635 N.Y.S.2d 9, 9 (1st Dep\\'t 1995).\\nIn the present case, I find that the conduct alleged by the plaintiff does not rise to the level of being \"so outrageous and extreme as to go beyond all possible [b]ounds of decency.\" Fischer, 43 N.Y.2d at 557, 402 N.Y.S.2d 991, 373 N.E.2d 1215. Rather, the conduct in question appears to be exemplary of typical heated discussions that take place, by plaintiff\\'s own account, during such meetings. (Castro Dep., August 7, 1995, at 93.) Accordingly, defendants\\' motion for summary judgment on this claim is granted.\\nThus, each of plaintiff\\'s common law claims suffers from a fatal defect. To the extent plaintiff has any remaining claims beyond those analyzed above, I decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over such claims in the absence of a valid federal claim.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor the reasons set forth above, defendants\\' motions for summary judgment are granted in their entirety. The Clerk of the Court shall mark this action \"closed.\"\\nSO ORDERED.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Plaintiff cross-moved for summary judgment, but failed to follow local Rule 3(g) or my individual rules in doing so. Moreover, plaintiff failed to come forward with sufficient evidence to withstand defendants\\' motions as discussed below. Thus, even if I were willing to overlook the procedural irregularities of plaintiff\\'s motion, it would still be unavailing.\\n[2]  The facts of this incident are discussed more fully in the section of this opinion which addresses plaintiff\\'s assault claim against individual defendant Steve Frankel. See infra part IV.D.3.\\n[3]  Under the 1199 union constitution, an organizer may be appointed by the union president or elected by the delegate. (Defendants\\' Exhibit A; Art. VII(2)(1) of the constitution). The president has the authority to terminate only appointed organizers; an elected organizer must remain employed until her term expires. (Id.). In the present case, plaintiff was an elected organizer and was dismissed immediately upon the expiration of her term.\\n[4]  Asthma is described as:\\n\\n[A] condition of the lungs in which there is widespread narrowing of airways, varying over short periods of time either spontaneously or as a result of treatment, due in varying degrees to contraction (spasm) of smooth muscle, edema of mucosa, and mucus in the lumen of the bronchi and bronchioles; these changes are caused by the local release of spasmogens and vasoactive substances (e.g., histamine, or certain leukotrienes or prosaglandins) in course of an allergic process.\\nGaddy v. Four B Corp., 953 F. Supp. 331, 338 (D.Kan.) (citing Stedman\\'s Medical Dictionary 158 (26th ed.1995)).\\n[5]  Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 to address the inadequacies of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Helen v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 329 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S. Ct. 64, 133 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1995). The definition of \"disability\" under the ADA mirrors that of the term \"handicap\" in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 701-96, and the two terms have been interpreted identically. See 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, App., Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, at 3 (\"Congress adopted the definition of [disability] from the Rehabilitation Act ... [and] intended that the relevant caselaw developed under the Rehabilitation Act be generally applicable to the term `disability\\' as used in the ADA.\").\\n[6]  Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295 (2d Cir. 1995), provides that individual defendants \\x97 even those with supervisory control \\x97 may not be held personally liable for alleged violations of Title VII. Id. at 1313. Plaintiff amended her complaint to delete individual defendants from her Title VII claims.\\n[7]  Section 296(6) of NYHRL states that it is an unlawful discriminatory practice \"for any person to aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce the doing of any of the acts forbidden under this article, or attempt to do so.\" N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296. Courts have interpreted this language to import liability on individual defendants in their personal capacities under such circumstances. Tomka, 66 F.3d at 1317.\\n[8]  Section 1981 protects the rights of individuals to \"make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to [enjoy] the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.\\n[9]  In her deposition, plaintiff stated, \"Let me tell you, with some things you read about unions, that\\'s how I felt. I thought this man was going to kill me or send somebody out there to kill me.\" (Castro Dep., August 7, 1995, at 92-93).\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 1409993}]"},{"id":744773,"date_filed":"1997-10-07","judges":"Higginbotham, Politz, Smith","case_name_full":"Betty TRAVIS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. the BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SYSTEM; University of Texas, at San Antonio, Defendants-Appellants","opinions":"[{'author_str': 'Higginbotham', 'per_curiam': False, 'type': '010combined', 'page_count': None, 'download_url': 'http:\/\/bulk.resource.org\/courts.gov\/c\/F3\/122\/122.F3d.259.96-50764.html', 'author_id': None, 'opinion_text': '122 F.3d 259\\n    74 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas.

HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:\\n    \\n    \\n      1\\n      Betty Travis prevailed in a jury trial against her employer, the University of Texas at San Antonio and the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System.  After reviewing the record, we conclude that as a matter of law Travis did not prove a violation of Title VII by a preponderance of the evidence.  Thus, we agree with the university and the regents that the lower court should have entered judgment against Travis.\\n    \\n    I.\\n    \\n      2\\n      The University of Texas at San Antonio hired Betty Travis on a tenure track as an assistant professor of mathematics in 1980.  The university awarded her tenure and promoted her to associate professor in 1985.  Her specialty is mathematics education.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      During the 1993-1994 academic year, she applied for promotion to full professor.  The university puts promotion applications through several tiers of reviews and recommendations.  An applicant\\'s file, which includes teaching evaluations, publications, letters of recommendation, evidence of service to the university, and so forth, moves from the applicant\\'s division to the applicant\\'s college to the provost to the president and ultimately to the board of regents.  Each stage involves an independent review.  The president\\'s decision to promote or not to promote--a decision that the board of regents virtually always adopts--comes in light of the recommendations from the lower levels, but is not dictated by them.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Travis received favorable recommendations from a committee of the Division of Mathematics and Statistics, from the division\\'s director, from a committee of the College of Sciences and Engineering, and from the dean of the college.  But the provost, Raymond T. Garza, recommended against promotion.  At trial, Garza explained that although Travis\\'s record in teaching and service was excellent, her research was meager and was not published in the better academic journals.  He noticed that reviewers on the division and college levels had failed to make detailed comments on her publications and concluded that they had not scrutinized them carefully.  Although the dean of the college praised Travis for her teaching skills and her success in landing grants for the university, his report indicated that Travis\\'s research was only \"marginally adequate.\"   After investigating Travis\\'s publications, Garza concluded that only one co-authored article had appeared in a \"premier\" journal and that she had placed only three articles in what he called \"category 2\" journals.  She had also published two chapters in books and three pieces in \"regional journals,\" but in Garza\\'s view those, along with her many conference presentations and invited talks, were of marginal scholarly significance.  Garza decided that, compared to other faculty members applying for status as full professor, Travis had not yet made a sufficient contribution to scholarship in her field.  The university\\'s president, Samuel Kirkpatrick, concurred in Garza\\'s analysis.  Travis received notification in March of 1994 that her application for promotion had been denied.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Travis immediately scheduled a meeting with Provost Garza in early April to discuss the reasons for the denial.  Garza explained that in order to earn a promotion, her research would need to be more substantial.  He indicated that, in combination with her outstanding teaching and service, she was very close to meeting the university\\'s expectations for a full professor.  Several weeks later, Travis told Garza that a journal had expressed interest in one of her papers, and Garza promised to bring that fact to the attention of the president, although he did not know whether it was too late to reverse the denial.  The president informed Travis by letter that if she had additional material to include in her file she would have to submit another promotion application in the 1994-1995 academic year.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      On May 11, 1994, Travis filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  She amended her charge on August 5 to add an allegation of unequal pay after learning that Jerry Keating, a male colleague hired in 1981, had been appointed Acting Division Director and earned $12,000 more than she did.  On September 24, she filed this lawsuit, which was removed to federal court.  The petition alleged causes of action against the university and the board of regents and also against Garza and Kirkpatrick in their individual capacities.  Travis alleged that the university had breached a contract and violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Texas Equal Rights Amendment by failing to honor a memorandum in which it notified Travis of her salary as Interim Associate Dean.  According to the university, a clerical error caused the memorandum to include the salary of Keating, who preceded Travis in the associate deanship, rather than Travis\\'s salary, which was nearly $12,000 less.  Travis also alleged that Garza and Kirkpatrick violated the First Amendment by retaliating against her for positions she took in the faculty senate.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      As a result of this suit, the university investigated Travis\\'s salary and discovered that a grant from the Office of Naval Research included a salary supplement that seemed to violate OMB guidelines.  Richard Dawson, the university\\'s director of internal audit, concluded that OMB Circular A-21 prohibited government grant money from going toward salary supplements above a faculty member\\'s base salary.  Although the university had approved the grant that included Travis\\'s supplement, there was no evidence that university officials were aware of any potential violation prior to the audit.  Once he learned about the violation, Kirkpatrick was concerned enough to order an audit of all salary supplements at the university.  This audit revealed that an untenured faculty member was also receiving a salary supplement that exceeded her base salary.  The university terminated both supplements in an effort to comply with federal regulations.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Travis applied again for full-professor status during the 1994-1995 academic year.  The only significant change was the acceptance of the article she had mentioned to Provost Garza after the first denial.  She also had a new article under submission, three new grants, and talks at two national conferences.  She got the same result:  the lower levels recommended promotion, but Garza recommended denying the application, and, in spite of Travis\\'s lawsuit, Kirkpatrick followed that recommendation.  Garza based his recommendation on the fact that Travis\\'s recently accepted article was to appear in a journal based in India with a circulation of only about 300.  Without any significant new research, he was unwilling to reach a different result in 1994-1995 than he had in 1993-1994.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      Travis had served as assistant director of her division since 1989.  But a few weeks after accepting the post of division director in January of 1995, Don Allen decided that the position of assistant division director was no longer necessary.  The university eliminated the position of assistant division director in February of 1995, although it paid Travis her administrative supplement through the end of the academic year.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      In an April 10, 1995, amended complaint, Travis sought damages for the removal of her salary supplement and her termination as assistant division director.  These actions, Travis alleged, along with the denial of her 1994-1995 application for a promotion, were retaliation for her 1994 EEOC complaint and lawsuit.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      The parties agreed to trial before a magistrate judge.  After five days of trial, the jury found that the university\\'s denial of Travis\\'s promotion was sexually discriminatory and that the university had retaliated against her for filing a discrimination suit.  It also found by special interrogatory that Garza and Kirkpatrick did not violate her First Amendment rights.  No other theories of recovery went before the jury.  The court ordered the regents to promote Travis as of September 1, 1994, and to pay back- and front-pay for the failure to promote, for the termination as assistant division director, and for the failure to pay supplemental grant salary.  It also granted Travis\\'s request in full for $91,088.75 in attorneys\\' fees.  The university and the regents appeal the court\\'s denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of law on both the sex-discrimination claim and the retaliation claims.1\\n    \\n    II.\\n    \\n      12\\n      We review de novo the lower court\\'s ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a).  Omnitech Int\\'l, Inc. v. Clorox Co., 11 F.3d 1316, 1322-23 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 815, 115 S.Ct. 71, 130 L.Ed.2d 26 (1994).  A court should grant a Rule 50(a) motion not only when the non-movant presents no evidence, but also when there is not a sufficient \"conflict in substantial evidence to create a jury question.\"  Foreman v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., 117 F.3d 800, 804 (5th Cir.1997) (quoting Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 411 F.2d 365, 375 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc)).\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Travis\\'s sex-discrimination and retaliation theories are subject to the burden-shifting analysis expounded in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), and St. Mary\\'s Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993).  But we need not parse the evidence into discrete segments corresponding to a prima facie case, an articulation of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer\\'s decision, and a showing of pretext.  \"When a case has been fully tried on the merits, the adequacy of a party\\'s showing at any particular stage of the McDonnell Douglas ritual is unimportant.\"  Molnar v. Ebasco Constructors, Inc., 986 F.2d 115, 118 (5th Cir.1993) (citation omitted).\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      A Title VII plaintiff bears the burden of proving not only that the employer\\'s purported reasons for taking an adverse employment action are pretextual, but also that the employer engaged in illegal discrimination.  Hicks, 509 U.S. at 511, 113 S.Ct. at 2749.   In this case, Travis\\'s burden is crucial for two reasons.  First, it means that \"[to] satisfy the statutory burden, the plaintiff must offer some evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that permits the jury to infer that the proffered explanation was a pretext for illegal discrimination.\"  Swanson v. General Services Admin., 110 F.3d 1180, 1185 (5th Cir.), petition for cert. filed, 66 U.S.L.W. 3129 (U.S. July 23, 1997) (No. 97-163).  Second, although evidence of pretext, in conjunction with a prima facie case, usually creates a jury question on the ultimate issue of discrimination, it does not always do so.  We engage in \"traditional sufficiency-of-the-evidence analysis\" to determine whether reasonable jurors could find discriminatory treatment.  Rhodes v. Guiberson Oil Tools, 75 F.3d 989, 993 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc).  In other words, it is possible for a plaintiff\\'s evidence to permit a tenuous inference of pretext and, by extension, discrimination, and yet for the evidence to be insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding of discrimination.  See Walton v. Bisco Industries, 119 F.3d 368, 372 (5th Cir. 1997) (\"Separate from her pretext evidence, Walton has offered nothing to suggest that impermissible discrimination underlies her termination.\");  Ontiveros v. Asarco, Inc., 83 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1996) (\"There may barely be enough evidence to sustain a finding of pretext.  However, there is insufficient evidence to support a reasonable inference of discrimination.\").\\n    \\n    III.\\n    \\n      15\\n      We turn first to Travis\\'s claim that the denial of her promotion was caused by sex discrimination.  Surprisingly little of the trial involved any reference to Travis\\'s sex.  A casual observer would have thought the jury had been asked to decide simply whether the university should have promoted Travis.  During their extensive testimony, Travis, Garza, and Kirkpatrick discussed primarily topics such as the prestige of various academic journals, the legitimacy of publications based on a doctoral dissertation, the scholarly value of oral presentations to gatherings of academics or groups of local educators, the place of education specialists within a division of mathematics and statistics, and so forth.  If nothing else, the trial made it clear that measuring the value of academic work is sticky business.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      Given the legitimate controversy over the quality and importance of Travis\\'s research, the jury could reasonably have concluded that U.T.--San Antonio should have promoted her to full professor.  Indeed, we assume for the purposes of this analysis that a reasonable jury could even have concluded that the adequacy of Travis\\'s research was not the real reason that the university twice denied her promotion.  The jury could have drawn the conclusion that the administration disagrees with Travis\\'s vision of the university.  Trial testimony suggested that she might oppose the university\\'s efforts to emulate major research institutions by focusing on developing doctoral programs.  The administration might have thought that her energetic pursuit of improvements in education are incompatible with the division\\'s mission of conducting pure research.  Or perhaps Garza and Kirkpatrick were simply jealous of her popularity among students.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      The dispositive question, however, is not whether the university made a mistake or whether it gave forthright explanations for its failure to promote.  Instead, we must determine whether Travis has presented sufficient evidence that her sex was the reason for the failure to promote.  We can find no more than a sliver of a suggestion that sex had anything to do with this employment dispute.  We conclude that this sliver, viewed against the background of the university\\'s evidence, is inadequate to produce an evidentiary conflict strong enough to survive a Rule 50(a) attack.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      First, Travis claimed that the university treated several male professors more favorably.  Lawrence Williams was the only other candidate from the College of Sciences and Engineering who applied for promotion from associate to full professor in the 1993-1994 cycle.  In 1994-1995, three other males applied for and received promotions to full professor.  Their success, according to Travis, indicates gender bias.  Provost Garza, however, explained to the jury in detail his system for evaluating scholarly accomplishments and why these four males had stronger records than Travis\\'s.  His calculations indicated that one of the males had 47 articles in \"premier\" journals, one had 15 such articles, one had six, and one had three.  According to Garza, Travis had published only one article in a top-tier journal.  The male with only three articles in a premier journal had also published a book with a university press, an accomplishment on which Garza placed significant weight.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      The university could have promoted Travis along with these males;  unlike many positions, there is no artificial limit on the number of full professors the university can sustain.  Thus, even if the four males were indeed better candidates than Travis, the denial of promotion could still conceivably have been caused by her sex.  But Travis did not give the jury any basis for concluding that sex played a role in these five promotion decisions.  For the most part, the four males had stronger records, measured by the standard academic criteria outlined by Garza.  We cannot turn an attack on those standards, however outmoded they might be, into a Title VII case.  By themselves, minor, reasonable disagreements about scholarly qualifications do not raise an inference that the disagreements have their roots in sex discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      Second, Travis urges that the jury could find disparate treatment based on a comment her dean made in 1986 that she was not \"tough enough\" to serve as acting director of her division.  That dean, however, is no longer employed by the university.  Kirkpatrick and Garza did not come to university until 1990 and 1991 respectively.  This isolated comment, made more than seven years before the disputed employment decisions by a person with no connection to Travis\\'s promotion applications, has no evidentiary force.  See Ray v. Tandem Computers, Inc., 63 F.3d 429, 434 (5th Cir.1995) (\"[A] single comment, made several years prior to the challenged conduct, is a stray remark too remote in time to support an inference of sex discrimination in later employment actions.\");  Mooney v. Aramco Services Co., 54 F.3d 1207, 1221 (5th Cir.1995) (finding irrelevant testimony of \"sporadic and isolated\" anecdotes of discrimination committed by supervisors not involved in the employment decisions at issue in the plaintiffs\\' suit).\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      Third, Travis indicated to the jury that females seeking promotion have faced discriminatory delays.  Since 1990, the university has denied promotions to two female associate professors and to one male associate professor within Travis\\'s college.  During that time, six applicants have received promotions to full professor on their first application, and all of them have been male.  This extremely small sample hardly establishes discrimination.  Moreover, the two women denied promotions were granted promotions when they applied the following year.  Travis\\'s evidence is weak on this score because it is geared to her division, which recommended Travis for promotion at each stage on both of her applications.  The more relevant statistic is university-wide, and there the university seems to be on solid ground.  Since 1990, 12 of 25 male applicants have received promotions from associate to full professor, while 7 of 13 female applicants received the same promotions.  Because Garza and Kirkpatrick must approve all of these promotions, these numbers suggest that they have not been inclined to turn women down based on their sex.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      Fourth, Travis attempted to draw the jury\\'s attention to pay disparities between her salary and Keating\\'s salary.  The university, however, accounted for these disparities by explaining that other universities had expressed interest in hiring Keating at higher salaries.  To stay competitive, the university had to make it worth Keating\\'s while to remain in San Antonio.  Travis did not effectively rebut this explanation.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Travis\\'s other references to sex discrimination during the trial were of no significance.  In sum, the relative absence of evidence of sex discrimination could not have given the jury insight into whether the university allowed Travis\\'s sex to play a role in the decision not to promote her.  The jury may not have liked the academic criteria in use at the University of Texas at San Antonio, but that was not a legitimate ground for finding the university liable for a Title VII violation.  When we view all of the evidence and resolve any doubts in favor of Travis, we cannot find sufficient evidence to support the jury\\'s finding that Travis\\'s being female caused the university to deny her a promotion.\\n    \\n    IV.\\n    \\n      24\\n      The jury found that the university retaliated against Travis for filing her discrimination claim in three ways:  (1) by denying her a promotion in the 1994-1995 cycle, (2) by removing her as assistant division director, and (3) by terminating her salary supplement from the Office of Naval Research grant.\\n    \\n    A.\\n    \\n      25\\n      As we have explained, the university satisfied its burden of producing evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason for denying Travis\\'s second application for a promotion.  Outside of disputing the merits of the promotion decision, Travis did not present evidence of retaliation.  Garcia explained that, because of the pending lawsuit, he made a special effort to confirm his conclusion that Travis\\'s file was not significantly different from the application she filed in 1993-1994.  Contrary to Travis\\'s suggestion, Garza did not testify that her suit caused him to try to find weaknesses in the 1994-1995 application.  A few days after the university denied Travis\\'s 1994-1995 promotion, the dean of the college remarked that it was because Travis \"hit them with a lawsuit.\"   But there was no evidence that the dean, who supported Travis\\'s promotion, had any special knowledge of retaliation.  In context, the remark was mere speculation.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Because of the marginal change in Travis\\'s credentials between the unsuccessful 1993-1994 application and the 1994-1995 application, a different decision on the merits of her promotion would have been unusual.  Under these circumstances, the mere fact that Travis filed an EEOC charge cannot support the jury\\'s conclusion that the denial was retaliatory.B.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      The university explained the termination of Travis\\'s position as assistant division director by offering the testimony of Linda Whitson, vice president of administration and planning.  Whitson stated that Don Allen became division director in January of 1995 and that he quickly decided that he did not need an assistant.  Travis did not contradict Whitson\\'s claim that there were no difficulties in the relationship between Allen and Travis.  More importantly, Travis did not attempt to refute the university\\'s evidence that Allen made his decision for legitimate administrative reasons.  There was no testimony that Allen even knew about Travis\\'s EEOC charge.  In other words, Travis did not carry her burden of producing evidence of retaliatory intent.  The jury might speculate that Allen was cooperating with Garza and Kirkpatrick to punish Travis, but without any evidence to that effect, we cannot uphold the jury\\'s findings.\\n    \\n    C.\\n    \\n      28\\n      Finally, the jury found that the university retaliated against Travis when it cut off her salary supplement.  According to the university, it did not discover that the supplement was in excess of Travis\\'s base salary until it investigated her allegation of unequal pay.  When the problem came to light, President Kirkpatrick took swift action:  he notified the director of internal audit and asked him to make the matter top priority.  Kirkpatrick\\'s memo mentioned Travis by name so that the auditor would at least have a place to begin his investigation.  Kirkpatrick also testified that he contacted the general counsel of the U.T. system, the executive vice chancellor of the system, and presidents of other Texas universities to determine whether his understanding of the OMB regulation was accurate.  After concluding that Travis\\'s supplement was a violation of federal law, he decided to end it prospectively only, assuming that the federal government would not be concerned about payments Travis had already received.  One other faculty member was receiving a similar grant, and the university ended it, as well.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      Again, aside from the fact that the university cut off the salary supplement after it knew of Travis\\'s suit, Travis did little to rebut the university\\'s account of its reasons for acting.  On cross-examination, defense witnesses admitted that the OMB regulation is difficult to interpret and that one might be able to make a colorable argument that Travis\\'s grant satisfied the regulation.  But Travis did not present testimony that Kirkpatrick or the university misunderstood the regulation, much less that their effort to adhere to their understanding of the regulation was pretextual.  Notwithstanding Travis\\'s accusations to the contrary, Kirkpatrick\\'s procedures were consistent with his stated concerns.  Without evidence, Travis\\'s assertion that retaliation caused the termination of her salary supplement is merely her own subjective belief, which is insufficient to create a jury question.

Pinkerton Tobacco Co., 58 F.3d 144, 153 (5th Cir.1995) (reversing a jury verdict of discrimination and collecting cases), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 709, 133 L.Ed.2d 664 (1996).\\n    \\n    V.\\n    \\n      30\\n      The judgment based on the jury verdict below is REVERSED, and a take-nothing judgment is RENDERED in favor of the university and the board of regents.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         The defendants have also appealed evidentiary rulings and the imposition of attorneys\\' fees.

Accordingly, we\\n\\naffirm the dismissal of Count 1.\\n\\n      We also conclude that the district court properly dismissed Yarcheski\u2019s\\n\\nclaim under Florida\u2019s Private Whistleblower Act (Florida Statute \u00a7 448.101 et seq.)\\n\\n(hereinafter \u201cFWA\u201d).

Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).  Specifically we are asked to determine whether a Title VII plaintiff, in order to establish a prima facie case must establish that the wrong allegedly committed was based on an impermissible motivation.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      This case arose out of a complaint that appellant was not furnished a stool that she claimed was necessary for her to sit on to perform her job and that she was eventually terminated from her job because of her race which is Negro.  At trial plaintiff showed that she was unable to perform her job without a stool because of a physical disability, that she was not able to obtain a stool all of the time, and that a white woman who was also not able to perform a similar job without a stool because of a physical disability was furnished one.  She also testified that she was terminated from her job because of her race and because of her political activity, and evidence was adduced that the appellee solicited applicants for the position vacated.  She did not, however, adduce direct evidence that because of an impermissible racial motivation the defendant failed to furnish her a stool and terminated her employment.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      McDonnell Douglas discloses that a plaintiff who alleges discrimination in conditions of employment must demonstrate, in order to make out a prima facie case, only that he is a member of a class entitled to the protection of Title VII, and that he is accorded treatment different from that accorded persons otherwise similarly situated who are not members of the class.  And, in order to make out a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge, a Title VII plaintiff must show only that he is a member of a class entitled to the protection of the Civil Rights Act, that he was discharged without valid cause, and that the employer continued to solicit applications for the vacant position.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      In this case, we hold that plaintiff established a prima facie case by demonstrating that she is a Negro, that because of her physical disability she needed a stool in order to perform her job, that she did not always have a stool, and that a white woman who also needed a stool to perform her job was always afforded one.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Although the district court, in its oral opinion, erroneously stated that plaintiff had not made out a prima facie case of discrimination in conditions of employment, we conclude that it did not err in dismissing the complaint after hearing all the evidence adduced at trial.  The court, upon consideration of the entire record, expressly determined that even if plaintiff had established a prima facie case, the defendant rebutted the demonstration by showing that it had provided plaintiff with a stool during her employment, that it was not responsible for the stool's disappearance at times, and that plaintiff's employment was terminated because of her apparent unwillingness and inability to perform available tasks.  These findings are not clearly erroneous.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Upon consideration and finding no other error, the judgment is affirmed.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        *\\n         The Honorable John Feikens, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation\\n      \\n    \\n    \", 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 328632}]"},{"id":330112,"date_filed":"1975-08-25","judges":null,"case_name_full":"11 Fair empl.prac.cas. 1132, 10 Empl.

He claimed that he failed because the examination was conducted in the English language and not in Spanish, and that he did not understand some of the language.  In his complaint he sought an injunction to restrain the Commission\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      . . .  from maintaining a policy, practice, custom or usage of discrimination against plaintiff and other Spanish-speaking persons in his class because of national and ethnic origin and ancestry by (a) refusing to provide pre-examination announcements and literature in the Spanish language; (b) refusing to administer examination instructions in the Spanish language; (c) refusing to provide the written Civil Service examinations for positions in the City of Cleveland in the Spanish language; and (d) refusing to provide retesting with appropriate safeguards, including the use of Spanish instructions and test material, for Plaintiff and other Spanish-speaking persons denied equal opportunities and protection under the law.  (A. 7)\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Frontera alleged that his Fourteenth Amendment rights and civil rights under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981, 1983 and 1985 had been violated and he prayed for damages in addition to injunctive relief.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      The case was tried before the District Court on the evidence and arguments of counsel.  The Court determined that the case was a proper class action.  The Court, in a written opinion in which it adopted findings of fact and conclusions of law, upheld the right of the Commission to conduct the examinations in English.  Frontera appealed.  We affirm.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      Frontera was born in Puerto Rico and educated there through the fourth grade.  He moved from Puerto Rico to Cleveland in 1953 at the age of 28.  Frontera speaks English poorly and can read basic English only with great difficulty.  He is a member of the Carpenter\\'s Union local, having been admitted to the Union on the basis of an oral test and an inspection of his carpentry work.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Counsel stipulated that Frontera has substantial skill as a carpenter.  He was a good \"handyman.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      The position of carpenter permanent appointment for which he applied was one of the highest paid positions in the City of Cleveland.  Craftsmen are paid at rates which sometimes exceed that of Commissioners in the various divisions.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      Frontera competently performed his job at the airport under the temporary appointment.  Frontera\\'s problem with the English language did not interfere with communication between his supervisor and him, nor did it interfere with the performance of the work assigned him.  Carpenters at the airport did not work from blueprints, but rather worked from verbal instructions, sketches and work orders.  He generally understood his supervisor\\'s instructions and would ask questions if they were necessary to clarify his instructions, and he had no difficulty with the sketches.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      The Civil Service Commission announced an examination for the skilled crafts on April 13, 1970.1  Frontera applied to take the carpenters\\' examination.  The examination was scheduled for May 20, 1970.  Frontera contacted several people in an effort to have the test administered to him in Spanish.  He was informed that he would be able to take the test in Spanish and on May 18, 1970 the Commission formally voted to have the test translated if possible.  However, due to a lack of both time and a trade dictionary for translating the technical terms in the carpentry test, the Civil Service employee who had been given the assignment of translating the test was unable to do so.  Therefore, the test was administered only in English.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Frontera did examine some text books which his daughter and wife obtained for him at the Municipal Reference Library but he testified that he did not understand the books.  He asked no one to help him prepare for the examination.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      The test consisted of a performance section in which the applicants constructed a wooden frame and a written section in which the applicants were asked questions dealing with carpentry.  An applicant could score 50 points on each section of the test.  A minimum score of 70 points was required to pass the test.  Frontera failed the test, scoring 36 points on the performance section and 31.349 points on the written section.  He ranked 103rd of the 127 applicants.  Concerning the performance section of the test, Frontera testified that he did not understand that he was allowed to use clamps to help construct the frame which clamps were on the work table.  The instructions for the performance section were given orally in English.  Frontera testified that he did not understand all of the instructions and that he did not ask any questions.  The examiner who administered the performance section of the examination testified that nothing was said at the examination concerning the tools the applicants could use, and that instructions were that the applicants were to build the object shown in a sketch given the applicants within a specified time.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Concerning the written section of the test, Frontera testified that he was unable to understand several of the words in the questions.  He was cross- examined concerning several of the test questions and testified that he did not know what \"beading work\" was, nor what \"factory or shop lumber\" was.  Concerning the statement \"Cedar wood is considered to be decay resisting,\" he testified that he did not understand the meaning of the word \"decay.\"  It should be noted that the words or terms that Frontera indicated that he did not understand dealt with the craft of carpentry.  The test did not require verbal ability unrelated to the craft of carpentry.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      The plaintiffs\\' statistical evidence, based upon the 1970 census, indicated that persons of Spanish nationality comprised 1.86% Of the Cleveland population and 1.22% Of the Cuyahoga County population.  There were 545 Spanish-speaking craftsmen and kindred workers residing in the city of Cleveland.  (Pl.  Exh. A &amp; M).  In 1973, Spanish surnamed Americans comprised approximately .5% Of the employees of the city of Cleveland, but none of the 574 craft positions were filled by Spanish surnamed Americans.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      There was no statistical evidence of the number of Spanish surnamed Americans employed by the city of Cleveland in 1970 and no evidence of comparative pass rates for Spanish surnamed and other applicants, other than for the May, 1970 craft examinations.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      The evidence was to the effect that Frontera was the only Spanish surnamed applicant taking the May, 1970 craft examinations; that witnesses involved in placing Spanish surnamed Americans for employment believed that more Spanish surnamed people would apply to take the Civil Service examinations if they were given in Spanish; and that some Spanish surnamed craftsmen who were witnesses would, in fact, apply to take the examinations if they were given in Spanish.  The District Court was of the view that the failure to give Civil Service tests in Spanish does have a discriminatory impact on the Spanish speaking population.2  Only one permanent appointment was made from the Civil Service list resulting from the May, 1970 carpenter\\'s examination.  The permanent appointment was made November 2, 1970 to the person receiving the highest grade.  Frontera was furloughed from his job on November 20, 1970 in a massive layoff of employees due to the city\\'s poor financial situation.  Frontera\\'s temporary job as carpenter at the airport has never been filled and the job has been eliminated as unnecessary.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      In considering this case we are mindful of several facts which help to place the case in perspective.  First, although Frontera criticizes the manner in which the test was constructed, his real complaint relates only to the language in which the test was advertised and administered.  Second, there is no training program for carpenters hired from the Civil Service list.  Carpenters are expected to possess the professional knowledge of the trade when they are hired.  Third, the examination did not require a general proficiency in the English language.  It used words and terms which ordinarily would be recognized and understood by a person knowledgeable in the carpentry trade.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      The principle issue in this case is whether the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983 require that information concerning a Civil Service examination be disseminated and the examination itself be administered in Spanish to Spanish-speaking applicants.  We hold that they do not.  This suit was not brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq. or the 1972 amendments 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(a) and (b).  We therefore have not considered these statutes and express no opinion with respect to them.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      The District Judge was of the view that conducting the test in English does have some discriminatory effect upon the Spanish-speaking portion of the city\\'s population.  He held that his finding cast upon the defendants the burden of proving that there was a compelling governmental interest in giving Civil Service examinations in English.  The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the defendants had met their burden of proof and established a compelling state interest in conducting the test in English.  We agree.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      The Court relied on Article XV Section 10 of the Constitution of Ohio which provides:\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      Appointments and promotions in the civil service of the state, the several counties, and cities, shall be made according to merit and fitness, to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by competitive examination . . .\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Before Civil Service, the spoils system was in vogue where patronage was dispensed by the political party in power.  The elimination of this practice was of such great importance to the people of Ohio that they dealt with it in their Constitution.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      Circuit Judge Levin Campbell who wrote the opinion for the Court in Boston Chapter N. A. A. C. P., Inc. v. Beecher, 504 F.2d 1017, 1022 (1st Cir. 1974) indicated that we ought not to discourage the use of tests and reopen the doors to political selection.  He stated:\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      In fairness to the state, we must not forget that civil service tests were instituted to replace the evils of a subjective hiring process.  Little will be gained by minorities if courts so discourage the use of tests that the doors to political selection are reopened. Moreover, a test, even one the cutoff of which does not demonstrably predict job performance, may serve worthwhile goals in gross by sifting from the pool of potential applicants those without enough motivation even to try to acquire the skills the test demands, and by discarding some few candidates who take the test but whose mental ability is so low that they are obviously unsuitable.  Finally, it is virtually impossible for an employer to justify to a mathematical certainty every selection device.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      As we noted earlier, the words and terms which Frontera was unable to understand would ordinarily be recognized and understood by a person knowledgeable in the craft.  Since there is no training program for carpenters or others in the skilled trades, and the requirements for applicants set out in the announcement include the requirement of carpentry experience, the Commission could assume that an applicant would be familiar with such terminology.  At the very least, use of such terminology would not ordinarily interfere with the test\\'s objective of identifying competent carpenters and ranking them for Civil Service.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      The Commission contended that it would be unreasonable to expect it to translate examinations into the various languages prevalent in a cosmopolitan community.  The testimony of employees of the Commission clearly revealed the limited resources of the Commission.  The Commission further contended that any form of test, other than a written test, would tend to interject the subjective judgment of examiners into the scoring process and could be manipulated to achieve the very sort of discrimination which the plaintiffs alleged.  Essentially the Commission claimed that the Civil Service system itself required the use of English, generally, for its successful operation.  There is not an iota of evidence tending to prove that the Commission, in conducting the examination in English, discriminated against the plaintiff on account of his nationality or against any other nationality.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      The findings of fact adopted by the District Court that plaintiff had established a prima facie case of discrimination are not supported by substantial evidence and are clearly erroneous.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      If Civil Service examinations are required to be conducted in Spanish to satisfy a few persons who might want to take them, what about the numerous other nationality groups which inhabit metropolitan Cleveland?   These other nationality groups would have just as much right as Frontera to have their examinations conducted in their own languages.  The city could not conduct examinations in Spanish and deny other nationalities the same privilege.  Denial to any would be invidious discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      In order to accommodate all nationality groups, the city might be compelled to establish a department of languages with a staff of linguists to translate the tests and supervise them.  This would, of course, be at the expense of the city which has severe financial problems at the present time and would ultimately be saddled upon the harried taxpayers of Cleveland.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      The District Court in determining the obligations of the Commission should have applied the rational basis test rather than the compelling interest test.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      As well stated by Mr. Justice Stewart in Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 486, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1162, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970):\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      But the Equal Protection Clause does not require that a State must choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem at all . . .  It is enough that the State\\'s action be rationally based and free from invidious discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      This is not a proper case in which to subject state action to strict judicial scrutiny.  San Antonio Independent Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973).\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      We are not dealing here with a suspect nationality or race.\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      It cannot be gainsaid that the common, national language of the United States is English.  Our laws are printed in English and our legislatures conduct their business in English.  Some states even designate English as the official language of the state, e. g. 127 Ill.Rev.Stat. &#167; 177.  Our national interest in English as the common language is exemplified by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1423, which requires, in general, English language literacy as a condition to naturalization as a United States citizen.\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      Statutes have been enacted which provide exceptions to our nation\\'s policy in favor of the English language to protect other interests and carry out the policies of the Fourteenth Amendment,3 but these exceptions do not detract from the policy or deny the interests the various levels of government have in dealing with the citizenry in a common language.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      We have not been favored by the plaintiff or any of the amicus curiae with the citation of a single case holding that Civil Service examinations must be conducted in foreign languages whenever requested by a nationality group and that failure to comply with such requests violates the constitutional or civil rights of the individuals composing such group.\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      A somewhat analogous situation was before the Ninth Circuit in Carmona v. Sheffield, 475 F.2d 738 (9th Cir. 1973) where a group of Spanish-speaking citizens claimed that they were denied their constitutional and civil rights because the state of California did not provide them with Spanish-speaking interviewers to assist them in the processing of their claims for benefits of unemployment insurance and did not send out notices and other communications to them in Spanish.  The court in rejecting these claims stated:\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      We believe that the additional burdens imposed on California\\'s finite resources and California\\'s interest in having to deal (with) only one language with all its citizens support the conclusion of reasonableness.\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      (Id. 739) citing Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970).\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      The decision of the Supreme Court in Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 94 S.Ct. 786, 39 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974) relied upon by the plaintiff is inapposite.  In that case the San Francisco school system neglected to provide English language instruction to about 1800 students of Chinese ancestry.  The court held that this violated a specific statute (42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d) and guidelines of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in connection with furnishing federal financial assistance to public school systems.  The court stated that it did not reach the Equal Protection Clause argument but relied solely on the statute and guidelines.\\n    \\n    \\n      43\\n      Frontera did not have a constitutional right to public employment.

In addition, the court determined that notwithstanding the holding of the Supreme Court in Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), plaintiffs were entitled to an award of an attorney's fee against the defendant, John H. Poelker, Mayor of the City of St. Louis, Missouri.  This court fixed a fee of $3500.00 as compensation for the services of plaintiffs' counsel at the appellate level, and remanded the case to the district court with directions to fix a fee for the services of counsel in that court.  Doe v. Poelker, 515 F.2d 541 (8th Cir. 1975).1\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      With specific regard to the attorney's fee to be awarded the court said (515 F.2d at 548):\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      . . . On remand the district court is directed to determine attorneys' fees and to award them to Doe, together with court costs, against the defendant Poelker for that portion of the case carried on in that court.  This should be a fair award based on the guidelines listed in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717--719 (5th Cir. 1974).2\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Pursuant to the mandate of this court, the district court held an evidentiary hearing.  It found that $9317.50 would be a reasonable fee for the district court services of plaintiffs' counsel, but on the basis of a statement appearing in the opinion in the Johnson case, supra, the district court concluded that no fee should be allowed since the plaintiffs were not contractually obligated to pay any fee, fixed or contingent, to their attorney.  An order denying plaintiffs' application for a fee was entered.  Plaintiffs appeal.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      Johnson was an individual and class action brought ultimately by two Negroes under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq.; they claimed racial discrimination in employment and sought back pay and injunctive relief.  The defendant initially objected to the maintenance of the action as a class suit and also demanded a jury trial on the legal issues presented by the complaint.  The district court upheld the defendant on both points.  Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 47 F.R.D. 327 (N.D.Ga. 1968).  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.  Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 417 F.2d 1122 (5th Cir. 1969).  Thereafter, the case was tried on the merits, and the plaintiffs prevailed.  They were represented throughout by practicing Georgia lawyers, some of whom at least were connected with the NAACP, and by a New York lawyer also associated with the organization just mentioned.  The district court allowed the plaintiffs a substantial attorneys' fee which plaintiffs deemed insufficient, and they appealed.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      The court of appeals was of the opinion that the district court had not spelled out with sufficient clarity the factors which it took into consideration in fixing the fee and remanded the case for reconsideration in the light of twelve specific factors which the appellate court mentioned.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      One of those factors was whether counsel were representing the plaintiffs on a contingent rather than a fixed fee basis if, in fact, the parties had made any agreement as to a fee.  After quoting from Clark v. American Marine Corp., 320 F.Supp. 709, 711 (E.D.La. 1970), aff'd 437 F.2d 959 (5th Cir. 1971), the court said (488 F.2d at 718):\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      . . . In no event, however, should the litigant be awarded a fee greater than he is contractually bound to pay, if indeed the attorneys have contracted as to amount.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      On the basis of that language the district court reasoned in the instant case that the obligation of a losing defendant to pay a judicially imposed attorney's fee to a successful plaintiff does not exceed in amount the fee that the plaintiff would be obligated contractually to pay to his lawyer in the absence of any judicial award, and that where the plaintiff's contractual obligation to his lawyer is zero, the defendant's obligation with respect to the court imposed fee is also zero.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      We do not think that the language from Johnson, quoted above, when read in context and in connection with the opinion of the district court in Clark v. American Marine Corp., supra, is fairly susceptible to the construction that the court below evidently placed upon it.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      The district court wisely entered his evidentiary findings with respect to a reasonable fee notwithstanding his conclusion that such fees could not be awarded.  We accept the district court's determination that in the light of the Johnson factors the sum of $9317.50 would be a reasonable fee for the services of plaintiff's counsel in the district court, and we remand the case with directions to the district court to enter an order awarding that amount against the defendant Poelker.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      Counsel for plaintiffs asks that we award an additional fee for his services in connection with this appeal.  We decline to do so.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      Reversed and remanded.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         See also Doe v.

Although not always so, present hiring practices are concededly nondiscriminatory.  Specifically, however, the Title VII complaint, filed after EEOC conciliation had failed, attacked as discriminatory the testing, seniority and certain other requirements for promotion and transfer purposes.  The district court held for the employer on all issues.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      We hold that the court erred in giving undue res judicata effect to prior litigation by the employees against certain unions, but not the employer, in the so-called Herron-Fluker cases.  We cannot ascertain the extent to which this error permeated the findings and conclusions of the district court.  In addition, a large number of cases with extensive opinions explicating the developing law in this field have been issued since the date of the district court\\'s order, December 7, 1972.  In view of these recent cases, it is apparent that the district court erred in ruling that compliance with the agreements approved by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, the so-called Jackson Memorandum, was sufficient to show compliance with Title VII.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      The principal cases upon which we rely and to which we commend the district court\\'s attention on remand are: Baxter v. Savannah Sugar Refining Corp., 495 F.2d 437 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1033, 95 S.Ct. 515, 42 L.Ed.2d 308 (1974); Franks v.

American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d 211 (5th Cir. 1974); Johnson v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 491 F.2d 1364 (5th Cir. 1974); United States v. Georgia Power Co., 474 F.2d 906 (5th Cir. 1973).  Pettway contains appropriate reference to practically every case in this Circuit in which the issues presented in this appeal are involved.  The application of these cases is for the initial consideration of the trial court after making findings as to the controlling facts.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      We vacate and remand for full consideration of plaintiffs\\' claims in light of the correct legal standards set forth in these cases and this opinion.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      The claims asserted are of the type now familiar to this Court and known collectively as a \"Title VII\" suit, even though the claims are alleged not only under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 2000e et seq., but also under 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1981, and under the duty of fair representation subsumed in the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. &#167; 151 et seq.  As in most Title VII cases the facts are particularly important in evaluating the plaintiffs\\' claims.  We will outline the facts briefly here and give them in more detail where necessary in the discussion of the law.\\n    \\n    I. FACTS\\n    \\n      12\\n      So far as relevant here, the work force is divided into three groups production, maintenance and supervisory.  The production jobs are arranged in several lines of progression.  That means that a new employee starts at the bottom and advances, a step at a time, as vacancies occur in higher paying jobs.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      The maintenance department consists largely of higher paying craft jobs.  These positions are filled by journeymen or apprentices IP has itself trained.  Apprentices may be chosen from production workers but such workers must fulfill age, education and testing requirements.  Basically, the production jobs are concerned with making the mill\\'s primary product, paper, while the maintenance employees are responsible for keeping the plant and equipment running.  Maintenance employees are generally more highly paid and more skilled.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      Except for \"straw bosses\" in the maintenance department, supervisors are salaried employees.  Most lower-level supervisors and foremen are former hourly paid employees promoted from the ranks.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      There is no dispute that prior to September 1962, IP operated on a segregated basis, pursuant to the policy of IP and the unions.  All black employees had the lowest paid and most menial jobs in the production department.  All the other departments and the lines of progression leading to the best paid jobs in the production department were reserved for whites.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      The local unions, which had jurisdiction over the jobs within the department, were also racially segregated.  The all-black locals of the International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill Workers (Sulphite Workers) and United Papermakers and Paperworkers, AFL-CIO (Papermakers) represented black employees, and the all-white locals of the Sulphite Workers, Papermakers and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers unions represented the whites.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      In September 1962, responsive to Executive Order No. 10925 relating to nondiscriminatory employment practices required of government contractors, IP, with the cooperation of the unions, abandoned its prior policy, desegregating the personal facilities and opening the various lines of progression to everyone.  No actual job desegregation occurred, however, as whites and blacks continued to migrate to those jobs in which their race was in the majority.  This is understandable, as the various lines of progression were within the work jurisdiction of different, segregated locals of the various unions.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      In May 1966, the Sulphite Workers merged their previously racially segregated locals and merged the lines of progression under their jurisdiction.  Since the relationship of the jobs after the merger of the lines was based on the relative pay rates and the black jobs were basically menial and low-paying, the effect was to \"stack\" the white lines on top of the black lines, locking the blacks into the lower paying jobs.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      In 1968, black employees complained to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCC) which was charged with the enforcement of Executive Order No. 11246, the successor of No. 10925.  After investigation OFCC notified IP that it was in violation of the order and proposed a 12-point plan to achieve compliance.  This led to a meeting in August 1968, at Jackson, Mississippi, between representatives of IP, the unions, the locals and OFCC.  An agreement was reached which modified the then-existing collective bargaining agreement in the production department.  This agreement was reflected in the Jackson Memorandum of Understanding.  It did not encompass the maintenance department at the Mobile mill or the supervisory jobs.\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      The object of the Jackson Memorandum was to provide blacks, who had previously been subjected to employment discrimination, the opportunity to reach their rightful place in the mill labor force.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      After IP had been administering the Jackson Memorandum for less than a year, the unions challenged the interpretation which IP had given some of its provisions.  OFCC was requested to settle the dispute.  Around the first of May 1969, IP received a letter from OFCC, referred to by all parties as the McCreedy Letter, which authorized IP to modify its administration of the Jackson Memorandum, thereby restricting some of the opportunities previously available to former discriminatees.\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      A second Jackson Memorandum was negotiated in 1972, which agreement expanded the opportunities of former discriminatees, partially by repudiating the restrictions contained in the McCreedy Letter.  The 1972 Jackson Memorandum was in effect at the time the district court rendered its decision in December 1972, but it had not been administered long enough to ascertain what effect it might have on former discriminatees.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      The Jackson Memorandum did not attempt any change in the practices relating to the maintenance craft positions, only in those regarding production positions.  While a production employee progresses up a \"line of progression\" within his department, some lines having fifteen or more positions, the maintenance crafts generally have two positions, apprentice and journeyman.  While in the apprentice position, the employee gains the skill and experience necessary independently to accomplish the mission of the journeyman.  Since 1954, when IP recognized the increasingly complex technology developing in the paper industry, an applicant for a maintenance apprenticeship has been required to achieve a minimum score on a battery of tests, whether he was applying for original employment in maintenance, or transferring from the production department or another maintenance craft position into the apprentice position.  Passage of the battery of tests relieves an applicant from IP\\'s requirement for new maintenance employees to have a high school education.  Since 1966, IP has continually evaluated its maintenance selection procedures to insure that they were effectively screening applicants.\\n    \\n    II. THE HERRON-FLUKER CASES AND RES JUDICATA\\n    \\n      24\\n      As their first argument on appeal, plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in holding that plaintiffs were precluded from litigating certain issues in the instant case by the doctrine of res judicata.  Specifically, plaintiffs challenge as error the district court\\'s conclusion that the decision of the court in the Herron-Fluker cases is res judicata:\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      . . .  as to any issues concerning former Papermakers Local Union 265, 265-A and 940, including union merger, processing of grievances for black members, promotion and seniority.  Judge Pittman\\'s decision also bars relitigation here of any individual claims of black employees who worked within the former Papermakers jurisdiction.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      Plaintiffs concede that judgment of the court in Herron-Fluker is res judicata as to the narrow questions of the 1968 merger of black Papermakers Local 406 into predominately white Papermakers Locals 265 and 940 and the alleged failure of those white locals to represent their new black members\\' interests fairly and adequately.  Plaintiffs argue, however, that the decision of the court in Herron-Fluker does not bar the instant action against Papermakers for systematic discrimination in employment opportunities.  We agree with the plaintiffs.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      For a prior judgment to bar a subsequent action, it is firmly established (1) that the prior judgment must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) that there must have been a final judgment on the merits; (3) that the parties, or those in privity with them, must be identical in both suits; and (4) that the same cause of action must be involved in both suits.  Wasoff v. American Automobile Ins. Co., 451 F.2d 767 (5th Cir. 1971).  If these elements are established, then the judgment or decree upon the merits in the first case is an absolute bar to the subsequent action or suit, not only in respect of every matter which was actually offered and received to sustain the demand, but also as to every ground of recovery which might have been presented.  Baltimore S. S. Co. v. Phillips, 274 U.S. 316, 47 S.Ct. 600, 71 L.Ed. 1069 (1927), as cited in Astron Industrial Associates v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 405 F.2d 958 (5th Cir. 1968).\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      The principle difficulty in applying the doctrine of res judicata is determining whether the cause of action in the first suit is identical to that in the second.  This court has recognized that \"the principle test for comparing causes of action is whether or not the primary right and duty and delict or wrong are the same in each action.\"  Seaboard Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 409 F.2d 879, 881 (5th Cir. 1969).  In the Seaboard Coast Line case, the court quoted from Baltimore S. S. Co. v. Phillips, supra,\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      A cause of action does not consist of facts, but of the unlawful violation of a right which the facts show.  The number and variety of the facts alleged do not establish more than one cause of action so long as their result, whether they be considered severally or in combination, is the violation of but one right by a single legal wrong.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      409 F.2d at 881.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      There is no one test for deciding whether the substances of two actions are the same for the purposes of res judicata.  As this Court noted in Acree v. Air Line Pilots Assn., 390 F.2d 199 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 852, 89 S.Ct. 88, 21 L.Ed.2d 122 (1968), various tests have been advanced, including\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      Is the same right infringed by the same wrong?  Would a different judgment obtained in the second action impair rights under the first judgment?  Would the same evidence sustain both judgments?\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      In conclusion, it is important to remember that\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      \"Res judicata is a principle of peace.  Under its influence an end is put to controversies.  Parties and their privies are made to abide definitive and final judgments and litigations are concluded.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      Res judicata rests on a rule of public policy designed to put an end to mere contentious litigations.  Under that rule an issue once finally settled by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, remains settled.  \"Public policy dictates that there be an end of litigation; that those who have contested an issue shall be bound by the result of the contest; and that matters once tried shall be considered forever settled as between the parties.\"\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      . . .  the rule of res judicata does not go on whether the judgment relied on was a right or a wrong decision.  It rests on the finality of judgments in the interest of the end of litigation and it requires that the fact or issue adjudicated remain adjudicated.  It, in short, is that one, who has permitted a final judgment to go against him is estopped, by that judgment, from contending elsewhere, against the parties to it and their privies that the fact or issue is otherwise than as there adjudged.\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      Bennett v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 113 F.2d 837, 839-840 (5th Cir. 1940) (footnotes omitted).\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      Where a second action between the same parties is upon a different cause of action, the principle of res judicata is applied much more narrowly.  In this situation, the judgment in the prior action operates as an estoppel, not as to matters which might have been litigated and determined, but only as to those matters in issue or points in controversy which were actually litigated and determined in the first proceeding.  In this sense, res judicata is usually and more accurately referred to as an estoppel by judgment, or collateral estoppel.  See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 68 S.Ct. 715, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948); Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U.S. 351, 24 L.Ed. 195 (1876).\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      In simple terms, collateral estoppel means that \". . .  when a issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\"  Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970).  This Court has stated that the three traditional requirements for the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel are\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      (1) The issue to be concluded must be identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) in the prior action the issue must have been \"actually litigated\"; and (3) the determination made of the issue in the prior action must have been necessary and essential to the resulting judgment.\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      James Talcott, Inc. v. Allahabad Bank, Ltd., 444 F.2d 451, 458-459 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 940, 92 S.Ct. 280, 30 L.Ed.2d 253 (1971).\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      It is against these basic principles that we must test the effect of the prior litigation upon the issues plaintiffs seek to litigate in this case.\\n    \\n    \\n      43\\n      In 1969, black plaintiff members of Local 406 employed at the Mobile mill filed a class action suit against United Papermakers and Paperworkers, AFL-CIO, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama.  Herron v. United Papermakers &amp; Paperworkers, AFL-CIO, No. 5665-69-P (S.D.Ala.).\\n    \\n    \\n      44\\n      Shortly thereafter, another class of plaintiffs as former members of Local 406 filed suit against Locals 265 and 940, United Papermakers and Paperworkers, AFL-CIO, and the International Union.  Fluker v. Locals 265 and 940, United Papermakers &amp; Paperworkers, AFL-CIO, No. 5839-70-P (S.D.Ala.).  These cases were consolidated for trial and the district court issued an unreported opinion on December 9, 1971.\\n    \\n    \\n      45\\n      The factual background of the Herron-Fluker cases is the same as the one in the case sub judice.  It is helpful, however, to outline the factual particulars which provoked the Herron-Fluker litigation in order to understand the precise wrongs which the Herron-Fluker plaintiffs sought to redress.\\n    \\n    \\n      46\\n      Pursuant to the Jackson Memorandum, IP and the union devised a method of merging lines of progression which were formerly segregated on the basis of race.  Part and parcel of the merger of the lines of progression included the merger of all black Papermakers Local 406 into predominately white Locals 265 and 940.  Effective April 30, 1969, the International union revoked the charter of Local 406 and transferred 117 of its members to Local 265 and 38 of its members to Local 940.  These transfers made a total membership in Local 265 of 534, 392-397 white and 142-137 black; and a total membership in Local 940 of 283, 235-237 white and 48-46 black.  It is without dispute that the merger of Local 406 into Locals 265 and 940 was the major precipitant of the Herron-Fluker litigation.\\n    \\n    \\n      47\\n      A complete review of the Herron-Fluker record reveals that the wrongs which the Herron and Fluker plaintiffs sought to redress in that litigation were (1) the merger of Local 406 into Locals 265 and 940 without protective transitional arrangements and (2) the alleged failure of Locals 265 and 940 to represent fairly the interests of their new black members.  Both the Herron complaint, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the National Labor Relations Act, and the Fluker complaint, seeking similar relief under 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1981 and the National Labor Relations Act, focus on the issues of merger and fair representation.  In the joint pre-trial document, plaintiffs identify their case as a proceeding to establish entitlement of the former members of Local 406 to protective transitional arrangements in the merger of the union with Locals 265 and 940.  And, although the district court begins its opinion in Herron-Fluker by characterizing the case as a class action to correct alleged racial discrimination in the promotion practices of the Mobile mill and Locals 265 and 940, the district court properly identifies plaintiffs\\' complaints as (1) an objection to the transfer of blacks into white unions without some transitional protection, and (2) an allegation that, since the merger, the predominately white unions have not fairly represented the interests of new black members.\\n    \\n    \\n      48\\n      The substance of defendants\\' argument on appeal is that the Herron-Fluker plaintiffs interjected the issues of promotion and seniority into the Herron-Fluker case in their Supplementary Pre-Trial Statement.  Defendants contend that even if the matter of discrimination in hiring, promotion and seniority practices was not raised in Herron-Fluker, it could have been litigated there.  Thus, defendants assert that, under the doctrine of res judicata, plaintiffs are barred from maintaining the instant action against Papermakers for systematic discrimination in employment opportunities.\\n    \\n    \\n      49\\n      A careful reading of the Herron-Fluker transcript indicates that plaintiffs introduced evidence of employment discrimination only as a background to their demands for protective transitional arrangements and fair representation.  As the district court noted in the Herron-Fluker opinion, the manner in which the lines of progression were merged under the Jackson Memorandum and the validity of aptitude tests for certain jobs in the mill were not issues in Herron-Fluker.  In contrast, the case at bar presents a direct attack against those actions and practices of International Paper, Sulphite Workers, and Papermakers which allegedly perpetuate a system of employment discrimination.  Under any one of the three tests which this Court recognized in Acree v. Air Line Pilots Assn., 390 F.2d 199 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 852, 89 S.Ct. 88, 21 L.Ed.2d 122 (1968), the causes of action in Herron-Fluker are not identical to plaintiffs\\' instant action for redress of systematic discrimination in employment opportunities.  Herron-Fluker bars the relitigation of the issues of merger and fair representation, strictly union practices, but it does not prevent plaintiffs from otherwise maintaining their suit against IP and the unions for the company\\'s transfer and advancement practices, joint union-company policies.\\n    \\n    \\n      50\\n      III. PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT SENIORITY SYSTEM (JACKSON MEMORANDUM)\\n    \\n    \\n      51\\n      On appeal the plaintiffs have mounted a multifaceted attack on the district court\\'s determination that the seniority system at IP after the Jackson Memorandum of 1968 fully reflected the \"rightful place\" doctrine which has long described this Court\\'s approach to a Title VII remedy.  See Local 189, United Papermakers &amp; Paperworkers v. United States, 416 F.2d 980 (5th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 919, 90 S.Ct. 926, 25 L.Ed.2d 100 (1970); 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 2000e-2(h).  We agree that, irrespective of the federal Government\\'s involvement in the formulation of the Jackson Memorandum, our recent cases have made clear that IP\\'s seniority practices perpetuated vestiges of past discrimination.  This Court has previously noted that passage of Title VII was sufficient to place employers on notice that racially discriminatory practices were unlawful, Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d 211, 255 (5th Cir. 1974); Johnson v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 491 F.2d 1364, 1377 (5th Cir. 1974), and that reliance upon Government approval of or participation in the formulation of the employment practice is not generally a defense in a Title VII suit.  See, e. g., Local 189, 416 F.2d at 997.  The seniority system must be measured against the requirements of Title VII and our cases construing that title.\\n    \\n    \\n      52\\n      Our recent cases have made clear that IP\\'s transfer and promotion practices, embodied in the seniority system, contain possibly impermissible vestiges of IP\\'s prior overt discrimination.  See, e. g., Pettway, supra; Johnson,  supra; United States v. Hayes International Corp., 456 F.2d 112 (5th Cir. 1972).  We are unable to determine from the district court\\'s decision, however, whether the offending practices make the seniority system in violation of Title VII.  We know that any facially neutral employment practice, such as requiring position-by-position advance up a line of progression (i. e., no \"job skipping\"), which perpetuates past bias, for example, by slowing a discriminatee\\'s advancement unnecessarily, is considered presently discriminatory.  Such a neutral practice, however, may not invalidate a seniority system under Title VII if IP can demonstrate that the practice is justified by business necessity.  Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 495 F.2d 398, 416 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. granted, --- U.S. ---, 95 S.Ct. 1421, 43 L.Ed.2d 669 (1975).  Because the district court did not consider whether some of IP\\'s neutral practices are presently so discriminatory, it did not make findings regarding their impediment or the business necessity of the practices which do in fact impede.\\n    \\n    \\n      53\\n      In particular, the district court should reexamine the red circling provision and its limitations, the absence of advanced entry levels and job skipping as it hinders more rapid advancement, and the residency and recall requirements under the McCreedy Letter.  If the court finds that in fact any of these practices hindered or discouraged any \"affected class\"1 member from reaching or seeking to reach his rightful place, IP should then be given the opportunity to prove that the practice was required by business necessity during the period it was used.  It is clear that in theory the absence of such provisions may impede an AC\\'s advancement, but we do not hold as a matter of law that there should always be job skipping, advanced entry, unlimited red circling or any other remedy.  The requirement for and feasibility of the remedy turn on factual matters.  IP\\'s seniority system was inadequate, however, as long as it did not have provisions for whichever of these remedies could have been implemented without creating a needlessly unstable situation.\\n    \\n    \\n      54\\n      The district court is free on remand to take new evidence on any issue as it deems appropriate.  We recognize that the seniority system at IP\\'s Mobile plant has been modified by another Jackson Memorandum, written in 1972, and, therefore, injunctive relief against the practices under the old system might be inappropriate.  See Pettway, supra at 244.  This is for the district court to consider in the first instance.  The fact that the practices have been abandoned will not relieve the court from deciding their discriminatory effect vel non, however, as such findings will bear upon possible back pay liability.  The court should carefully examine each practice for its discriminatory effect and make specific findings on such effect.  For such aid as it may be to the parties and the district court on remand, we will discuss in some detail the problem areas of the seniority system.\\n    \\n    \\n      55\\n      A. Red Circling.\\n    \\n    \\n      56\\n      It is now clear that red circling is a necessary element of a Title VII remedy in most cases.  See, e. g., Pettway, 494 F.2d at 248 n.99.  Plaintiffs offer two objections to the red circling provided in the Jackson Memorandum: (1) it was limited to employees with a permanent rate of $3.00 per hour or less, even though some ACs were making more than that, and (2) it was available only if an application to transfer was filed within six months of the Jackson Memorandum\\'s effective date.  Plaintiffs argue that neither restriction on the availability of red circling can be justified by business necessity, as they must be if they impede or restrict the movement of former discriminatees to their rightful place.  See Johnson v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 491 F.2d at 1374 n.28; Long v. Georgia Kraft Co., 450 F.2d 557 (5th Cir. 1971).  The district court did not specifically consider this issue, and on remand it should do so.\\n    \\n    \\n      57\\n      It is clear that, in theory, a $3.00 per hour limitation on availability of red circling could inhibit an AC\\'s movement, penalizing his choice to transfer by cutting his pay.  See Pettway, 494 F.2d at 223.  The evidence in this case, however, is scant on the existence, in fact, of any AC who was so inhibited.  The only evidence to which plaintiffs direct us is the testimony of an IP executive that there were \"probably\" a few ACs being paid at a rate higher than that.  If the plaintiffs can demonstrate on remand that the limitation presented, or as presently existing does present, a practical impediment to any ACs, the district court should take appropriate action.\\n    \\n    \\n      58\\n      The time limitation to take advantage of red circling is similarly not per se unlawful.  This Court has frequently recognized that the employer has an interest in reestablishing stability to his work environment and that reasonable time limitations on the extraordinary system created to provide relief for prior discriminatees is permissible.  See, e. g., Franks, 495 F.2d at 417 n.16; Johnson v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 491 F.2d at 1374; United States v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 451 F.2d 418, 459 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 906, 92 S.Ct. 1607, 31 L.Ed.2d 815 (1972).  This cannot be considered in a vacuum, however, but must be viewed in light of the entire remedy afforded.  Since the district court found that IP had conscientiously implemented the Jackson Memorandum and that all ACs who had desired to transfer had been given the opportunity when one arose, it may be that the time limitation, too, presented only a theoretical and not a practical restraint on AC movement.  The district court may properly reconsider this entire issue on remand.\\n    \\n    \\n      59\\n      B. The McCreedy Letter Modifications to the Jackson Memorandum.\\n    \\n    \\n      60\\n      The McCreedy Letter resulted in two changes in IP\\'s administration of the mill seniority provisions.  First, an AC had to be permanently assigned to the position immediately below a vacancy in order to bid for the vacancy.  Prior to the McCreedy Letter, IP had allowed an AC to bid for a vacancy when the AC was even temporarily assigned to the immediately inferior position in the line of progression.  The second change was in the utilization of \"recall rights.\"  Prior to the McCreedy Letter an AC was allowed to advance using mill seniority even when competing with a NAC who had \"contractual\" recall rights to the job for which they were competing.  The McCreedy Letter authorized giving the NAC with recall rights a preference, regardless of mill seniority.\\n    \\n    \\n      61\\n      It is obvious that the effect of the two changes authorized by the McCreedy Letter was to slow the advancement of the ACs to their rightful place.  It is equally obvious that these two policies could not be justified as required by business necessity: less racially discriminatory solutions not only existed, but had previously been used by IP.  Cf. Pettway, 494 F.2d at 244-245; Jacksonville Terminal Co., 451 F.2d at 451-453.  The Jackson Memorandum of 1972 rejects both of the McCreedy Letter practices, so their effect on possible injunctive relief in this case may be minimal.  The restrictions may be important, however, in deciding whether back pay is to be awarded to the class members.\\n    \\n    \\n      62\\n      Unlike our previous cases, here the Government did more than merely acquiesce in racially discriminatory private conduct.  When left to construe the Jackson Memorandum for itself, IP had applied it significantly more liberally in assisting ACs to reach their rightful place.  It may be that this \"government-imposed\" discrimination will tip the scales in favor of finding \"substantial injustice,\" which would relieve IP of the requirement to make restitution to the ACs by payment of back pay.  This is better left to the district court which can consider these factors in conjunction with any other relevant evidence on back pay liability.  For example, the court should also consider the extent to which the unions, whose disagreement with IP\\'s policy spawned the McCreedy Letter, might be held separately liable for pack pay, cf. Carey v. Greyhound Bus Co., 500 F.2d 1372, 1378-1379 (5th Cir. 1974), and the possibility that IP might be liable for back pay only to those ACs who were impeded by the inadequacies of the Jackson Memorandum other than the McCreedy Letter modifications.  This is a complex issue which has never been fully considered by the district court.\\n    \\n    \\n      63\\n      C. Shortening of Lines of Progression, Advanced Entry Levels and Job Skipping.\\n    \\n    \\n      64\\n      Plaintiffs argue the Jackson Memorandum was inadequate to remove all impediments to ACs reaching their rightful place because of the absence of either mandatory provisions allowing them to enter a line of progression above the normal entry level and to skip positions not necessary to provide training for high level jobs, or a mandatory provision that the lines of progression be shortened.  See Pettway, 494 F.2d at 248-249; Hayes International Corp., 456 F.2d at 117-119; Long, 450 F.2d at 560.\\n    \\n    \\n      65\\n      While the district court erred in not subjecting the requirements of the present seniority system to the close scrutiny required for a showing of business necessity, it did express respect for the complexity of IP\\'s Mobile mill operation and for the functional interrelationship of the jobs in the lines of progression.  See 352 F.Supp. at 237 nn.5-6.  Therefore, we pretermit consideration based on a cold record of whether all elements of the old system could be justified as required by business necessity, with no less discriminatory alternatives available to IP.  Again, the resolution of some of these issues may be important only in determining issues of back pay significance.  It probably will be necessary, for example, to determine which jobs could have been skipped and which positions ACs could have entered at above the normal entry level to decide who, if anyone, is entitled to back pay for being deprived of their rightful economic place and how much the award should be.  It is clear, however, that the total absence of job skipping from the 1968 Jackson Memorandum remedy cannot be justified as a business necessity in light of IP\\'s ability to institute it in 1972, apparently without significant disruption.\\n    \\n    \\n      66\\n      Advanced entry levels may also be a proper subject for injunctive relief, when the district court reconsiders this case on remand.  Forcing a former discriminatee to transfer to the lowest job in a line of progression can only be required if it can be justified by business necessity.  If the entry level cannot be so justified, former discriminatees must be allowed to transfer into a line as high as their qualifications and mill seniority will allow.\\n    \\n    \\n      67\\n      We note that under the 1972 Jackson Memorandum, IP has begun to operate under a somewhat different system, establishing a \"residency period\" for each job, but with at least twenty-four jobs having a zero residency period.  In effect, then, these twenty-four jobs may be skipped by an AC advancing to his rightful place.  On remand, the district court should now examine the new system, including the residency period for each job, if challenged by plaintiffs, to insure that the system restrains ACs no more than the minimum justifiable under the business necessity test.  See Pettway, 494 F.2d at 248-249; Hayes International, 456 F.2d at 117-119.\\n    \\n    \\n      68\\n      We are aware that many of the \"benefits\" of the Jackson Memorandum accrued not only to blacks who had been the victims of prior discrimination, but to all IP employees.  This understandable desire on the part of IP and the unions to provide the benefits to all employees, coupled with their apparent concern not to create a highly unstable situation at the Mobile mill, may explain some of the provisions of the Jackson Memorandum.  This desire to maintain stability while avoiding the appearance of preference does not justify, however, failure to provide a remedy which makes the prior discriminatee whole as far and as fast as possible.  See Franks, 495 F.2d at 415-416.\\n    \\n    \\n      69\\n      In summary, we remand the issue of the seniority system for the production department for reconsideration in light of our recent cases, not available to the district court on initial consideration, but which more fully explicate the correct allocation of burdens of proof on such issues.  The district court is free to receive whatever evidence it feels necessary in light of our opinion and remand, and to determine the appropriate remedy, following the guidance of the cases cited herein and considering any facts which are presented to the court.  We note that nothing in this opinion should be taken to mean that IP must place anyone in a job for which he is not qualified.  Of course, the qualifications must be bona fide and meet the test of business necessity.  Pettway, 494 F.2d at 248-249; Local 189, 416 F.2d at 988.\\n    \\n    IV. MAINTENANCE CRAFT POSITIONS\\n    \\n      70\\n      Plaintiffs assert that IP\\'s practices regarding the maintenance craft positions have elements of both present discrimination and \"neutral\" policies which perpetuate past bias in hiring.  Their allegations of present prejudice center on the battery of tests which any applicant for a maintenance craft job must pass.  The presently neutral requirements which have the effect of \"locking in\" the effects of past discrimination are the maximum age restriction for entry into maintenance crafts, and the length of the apprenticeship.  The district court found against plaintiffs on all of these issues.  Plaintiffs attack the district court\\'s conclusions as clearly erroneous factually and as based on incorrect legal analysis.\\n    \\n    \\n      71\\n      A. Testing Requirements for Maintenance Craft Positions.\\n    \\n    \\n      72\\n      At the time of trial, IP required all applicants for any maintenance craft position, whether a new applicant or a current employee seeking to transfer, to take and pass a battery of three tests: The Wonderlic Personnel Test (passing score 18); The Bennett Test of Mechanical Comprehension (passing score 45 (Form AA) or 37 (Form BB)); and the Revised Minnesota Paper Form Board Test (passing score 45).  Counsel for IP informed the court at oral argument that the Minnesota Paper Form Board Test is no longer administered by IP as an element of its maintenance craft selection process.\\n    \\n    \\n      73\\n      The district court found that plaintiffs did not carry the initial burden of demonstrating that IP\\'s testing program operates to disqualify blacks at a substantially higher rate than white applicants.  352 F.Supp. at 246, 249; see Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971).  The court also found that the extensive documentary evidence and expert testimony which IP presented on the job-relatedness of its testing program demonstrated that the tests \"measure the person for the job and not the person in the abstract.\"  352 F.Supp. at 247-248.  Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred both in concluding that the testing requirement had no disparate impact and in finding that IP had adequately validated its testing battery.\\n    \\n    \\n      74\\n      The problem we have with this issue is our inability to determine what the district court meant by the statement:\\n    \\n    \\n      75\\n      At the trial, plaintiffs did not introduce evidence as to the total number of black and white applicants who had taken the test batteries in any identifiable period of time, how many had met the qualifying scores on the batteries, or the comparative qualifying rate of black and white applicants on the company\\'s test batteries.  Therefore, no evidence was offered concerning the impact of the company\\'s testing program on the ability of blacks to obtain employment at the Mobile Mill.\\n    \\n    \\n      76\\n      352 F.Supp. at 246 (emphasis added).  On appeal plaintiffs point to the evidence they offered in the trial court: an exhibit purporting to analyze the pass-fail rate for black and white transfer applicants for a given period, expert testimony on the general disparate impact of written aptitude tests, an \"exhaustive statistical study\" of scoring patterns according to race prepared by the publishers of the Wonderlic test, the testimony of some black IP employees regarding their own difficulty in passing the tests, and the unexplained absence of a significant number of blacks in the maintenance craft positions.  Plaintiffs contend that the sparsity of evidence is explained in part by IP\\'s objections to some of plaintiffs\\' discovery and the district court\\'s circumscription of plaintiffs\\' examination of IP employees at trial.  See Rogers v. International Paper Co., 510 F.2d 1340, 1348-1349 (8th Cir. 1975), petition for cert. filed, 43 U.S.L.W. 3666 (U.S. May 17, 1975) (No. 74-1446).  Defendants do not defend the \"no evidence\" finding by the district court but instead attempt to discredit the evidence plaintiffs did offer.  It is apparent that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding no evidence of disparate impact.\\n    \\n    \\n      77\\n      We are disinclined, however, initially to weigh the evidence on appeal on the admittedly sparse record.  This case is being remanded for other reasons anyway, and we consider it a better practice to require the district court to consider and evaluate the evidence, receiving new evidence as appropriate.  Plaintiffs will then have an opportunity to discover and present evidence on the impact of the tests at IP\\'s Mobile mill.\\n    \\n    \\n      78\\n      If upon remand the district court finds the tests have a disparate impact on blacks, see Rogers v. International Paper Co., supra, it is clear that the validation is inadequate as a final validation under our holding in United States v. Georgia Power Co., 474 F.2d 906 (5th Cir. 1973).  The district court did not have the benefit of that exhaustive opinion when considering this case initially and, consequently, found the test battery to be validated, even though the validation procedure did not follow EEOC guidelines, as generally required under Georgia Power Co.  See Pettway, 494 F.2d at 221; 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1607 et seq.  (1974).\\n    \\n    \\n      79\\n      B. High School Diploma Requirement.\\n    \\n    \\n      80\\n      The parties disagreed on appeal as to whether there is a requirement that applicants for maintenance positions have a high school diploma.  The district court can resolve this factual issue on remand.  A high school diploma requirement is not per se illegal, but if plaintiffs can demonstrate that one exists and that it has disparate impact on the black class members, IP would then be required to justify it as a business necessity.  See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. at 431-433, 91 S.Ct. 849.  The EEOC guidelines should once again provide the yardstick against which such validation should be measured.  See United States v. Georgia Power Co., 474 F.2d at 918-919; 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1607.2 (1974).\\n    \\n    \\n      81\\n      C. Age Restrictions and Apprenticeship Periods.\\n    \\n    \\n      82\\n      Unlike the testing requirements, the age restriction, also neutral on its face, is attacked by plaintiffs only as it \"locks-out\" the victims of prior discrimination from the maintenance craft positions.\\n    \\n    \\n      83\\n      In the court\\'s Pretrial Order of September 5, 1972, the parties stipulated that prior to September 1, 1962, all jobs, including maintenance positions, were segregated by race; therefore, no issue as to the existence of previous discrimination exists.  The only question is whether the age requirement perpetuates that discrimination.  It clearly does.  Thus, it cannot be used as an obstacle to any discriminatee who desires to seek his rightful place in the maintenance department, unless the age requirement can be justified as a business necessity.  See Pettway, 494 F.2d at 250.  On remand, IP must demonstrate the business necessity of its age limitation or the district court should enjoin its use through the first transfer of any class member who desires to transfer and who is otherwise qualified.\\n    \\n    \\n      84\\n      Similarly, the length of each required apprenticeship should be scrutinized to insure that it does not unnecessarily slow the advancement of a prior discriminatee to his rightful place.  The district court should insure that any needless impediment is removed for every class member.V. SUPERVISORY POSITIONS\\n    \\n    \\n      85\\n      Plaintiffs point to the nearly total exclusion of blacks in supervisory positions as demonstrating continued discrimination against blacks.  IP does not question that blacks were previously excluded from supervisory positions, but challenges plaintiffs\\' proof that there is any present discrimination.  On remand, the district court should examine all of the evidence on this issue to determine whether plaintiffs have proved a case of present discrimination in supervisory selection.  See Hester v. Southern Railway Co., 497 F.2d 1374 (5th Cir. 1974).  The selection process followed by IP provides a ready medium for racial discrimination and, accordingly, should be closely scrutinized.  See Pettway, 494 F.2d at 240-243; Rogers v. International Paper Co., 510 F.2d at 1344-1347.\\n    \\n    \\n      86\\n      It is clear, on the other hand, that the present selection process could well perpetuate the discrimination previously practiced against the plaintiff class in this case, even if it is \"neutral\" as to present discrimination.  The members of the plaintiff class were previously excluded from the lines of progression from which supervisors were and are selected.  The Jackson Memorandum provided some opportunity for them to advance toward their rightful place, but we have previously noted its inadequacies.  To the extent that the plaintiffs are ineligible for supervisory positions because they are not high enough in the lines of progression from which they were previously barred by discrimination, they are disadvantaged because of their employer\\'s prior illegal practices.\\n    \\n    \\n      87\\n      Under such circumstances, IP must demonstrate that the requirement of being high in a line of progression is compelled by business necessity.  If it cannot be so justified, it cannot be used to foreclose a class member\\'s consideration for a supervisory position.  As always, however, IP is not required to give a supervisory position to anyone who does not have the ability to do the job.  See Pettway, 494 F.2d at 249.\\n    \\n    VI. BACK PAY AND ATTORNEY\\'S FEES\\n    \\n      88\\n      Concluding that IP\\'s present system was free from the taint of discrimination, the district court refused to award back pay or attorney\\'s fees.  352 F.Supp. 249-250.  That decision must be reevaluated in light of this opinion, the result of further proceedings on remand and the significant recent decisions of this Circuit on the issue of back pay.\\n    \\n    \\n      89\\n      Recently, well after the district court\\'s decision in this case, the Supreme Court issued an opinion defining the parameters of an appropriate back pay award in a Title VII action.  Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,--- U.S. ---, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 43 L.Ed.2d --- (1975).  That case and the recent cases from this Circuit discussing back pay provide the framework in which the district court should decide this case.  See, e. g., Baxter v. Savannah Sugar Refining Corp.,  495 F.2d 437, 442-445 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1033, 95 S.Ct. 515, 42 L.Ed.2d 308 (1974); Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 495 F.2d at 421-422; Pettway, 494 F.2d at 251-253; Johnson v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 491 F.2d at 1374-1380.  The district court will now have the opportunity to apply these newly illuminated principles, after having fully considered the various issues which we remand.  See Duhon v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 494 F.2d 817, 819 (5th Cir. 1974).  In the district court\\'s opinion, care should be taken to explain fully the basis for any back pay decision so that it may be adequately reviewed by this Court if an appeal is taken.\\n    \\n    VII. CONCLUSION\\n    \\n      90\\n      In summation, we remand this case to the district court for reconsideration of whether any practices followed by IP are either presently discriminatory or, even though \"neutral\" on their face, presently perpetuate the disadvantaged position in which the ACs find themselves because of IP\\'s prior discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      91\\n      The distinction between these two forms of present discriminatory effect is most important in fashioning an appropriate remedy.  If the practice presently discriminates, it should be eliminated in its entirety.  On the other hand, an otherwise neutral practice which perpetuates the effect of the employer\\'s past discrimination need only be temporarily modified to provide those against whom it unfairly operates an opportunity to avoid that effect.  Thus, a \"neutral\" seniority system should not be enjoined totally, but should be modified only as it applies to those employees who were previously subjected to discrimination, only to the extent necessary to remove the elements perpetuating that discrimination, and only for a limited period of time.  Such a system should be allowed to apply unabated to all employees, black and white, against whom the employer did not discriminate.  See Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 495 F.2d at 415-416.\\n    \\n    \\n      92\\n      The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has recently decided a case involving these same defendants, but different mill and plaintiff class.  Rogers v. International Paper Co., 510 F.2d 1340 (8th Cir. 1975), petition for cert. filed, 43 U.S.L.W. 3666 (U.S. May 17, 1975) (No. 74-1446).  The opinion in that case has been cited in some of the areas where applicable and where the law of the Eighth Circuit appears to be the same as this Circuit.  The district court should be cautious, however, in placing reliance on that opinion, as the law of the Eighth Circuit significantly differs from that of this Circuit on some issues, for example, back pay entitlement.  Compare Rogers v. International Paper Co., 510 F.2d at 1357 with Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d at 251-263.\\n    \\n    \\n      93\\n      Reversed in part, and vacated in part and remanded.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         The Jackson Memorandum defined the \"affected class\" as \"Negroes employed prior to September 1, 1962,\" when IP had opened all lines of progression to all races, and \"Negroes employed since September 1, 1962, but initially placed in a job line of progression formerly considered as an all-Negro job or line of progression.\"  A member of the affected class will be referred to as an \"AC\" and any other employee of IP as a \"NAC\" for \"non-affected class member.\"\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 327630}]"},{"id":1390387,"date_filed":"2007-12-21","judges":"Easterbrook, Chief Judge, and Flaum and Williams, Circuit Judges","case_name_full":"Elizabeth A.

Occhialino (argued), E.E.O.C., Washington, DC, Amicus Curiae.\\nBefore EASTERBROOK, Chief Judge, and FLAUM and WILLIAMS, Circuit Judges.\\nEASTERBROOK, Chief Judge.\\nThe Supreme Court held in National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 115-21, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002), that a hostile working environment is a single unlawful practice under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A charge of discrimination based on such a practice covers all events during that hostile environment, if the charge is filed within 300 days (180 days in some states) of the last act said to constitute the discriminatory working condition. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1). We held in Isaacs v. Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition, Inc., 485 F.3d 383 (7th Cir.2007), that hostile working conditions at a single place of employment are a single unlawful practice. Title VII creates responsibilities for \"employers\" as entities. Employers may not turn a practice that Morgan deems unitary into two or more distinct practices by calling each subdivision of the workplace a separate \"team.\" Most employers\\x97and Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition is no exception\\x97allow plant managers and human-relations departments to control working conditions plant-wide. When a single managerial staff or chain of command decides to permit the men in the workplace to make life miserable for the women, that is a single unlawful practice whether or not a particular woman moves from one team to another within the plant.\\nCarol Isaacs initially worked on a Packaging Team at Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition in Richmond, Indiana, and was transferred to a Stretchwrap Team. Jackie Vanderpool supervises all human-relations issues at the Richmond plant and reports to a plant manager with authority over everything that happens there. We held that all events during Isaacs\\'s employment at the plant could be considered as part of one practice, even though many of the incidents about which she complained had occurred more than 300 days before she filed her charge.\\nElizabeth Bright was hired at the Richmond plant during February 2000, the same month as Isaacs, and quit in November 2002. While Isaacs started with a Packaging Team, Bright was assigned to a Processing Team, where she worked for about 10 months before being transferred to a Stretchwrap Team. Between October 2001 and November 2002, both Isaacs and Bright were assigned to a Stretchwrap Team. Bright filed her charge of discrimination early in 2003 and filed suit later that year.\\nBright presented evidence that the men routinely vexed the women in an effort to make them quit. The tactics included unwelcome sexual overtures and sex-related chatter, streams of misogynistic invective, refusal to train (team leaders tried to get women to view pornographic images on the men\\'s computers, and, when women declined, the men would declare that they had no time for training), assigning women to the dirtiest jobs (which team leaders *769 called \"women\\'s work\"), and threats of violence, some of which were fulfilled (for example, Bright\\'s dog was shot, supposedly as a warning to her). According to one of Bright\\'s witnesses, on being told that men referred to female workers as \"whores,\" \"cunts,\" and \"bitches,\" Vanderpool replied: \"a hostile work environment is a productive work environment.\" As we remarked in Isaacs, 485 F.3d at 387: \"A jury could infer that working conditions for female laborers at Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition were materially worse than the conditions for male laborers, that managers of the firm knew this, and that they did nothing because the firm deemed the men\\'s morale more important than the women\\'s welfare.\"\\nHill\\'s Pet Nutrition contended that none of this testimony should be believed. It did, however, concede having a problem with pornography in the workplace, and it suspended 11 men for two weeks in March 2002 in response to their accumulation and viewing of inappropriate materials on the firm\\'s computers. The employer maintains that this step solved the only problem that women had encountered at work.\\nBefore trial, the district judge concluded that Morgan entitles Bright to present evidence of the working environment during her complete 2 years and 9 months of employment. 2005 WL 1799440, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15470 (S.D.Ind. July 26, 2005). In mid-trial, however, the judge changed his mind about the temporal limits. He instructed the jury that it could not consider anything that happened to Bright before March 29, 2002, approximately 300 days before she filed her charge, and could not consider at all any of the incidents related to the pornographic images. So instructed, the jury returned a verdict against Bright. Her lawyer did not make a particularly articulate objection to the instruction, but he did remind the judge about Morgan, which under the circumstances (including the pretrial ruling following briefs on this very subject) was enough to preserve the issue for appellate review.\\nThe district judge\\'s instruction was mistaken, quite apart from our conclusion in Isaacs that a hostile working environment must be treated as one unlawful practice even if the employee moves from one team to another. For Morgan itself shows that a hostile environment in a single posting is one practice. Bright was part of a Stretchwrap Team for 22 months, from the beginning of 2001 until she quit in November 2002, but the judge allowed the jury to consider only the events of the final eight months, from April through November. As Isaacs holds, the judge should have allowed the jury to consider the working conditions that Bright encountered for her entire employment at the Richmond plant.\\nThe district judge seems to have believed that the discipline of the 11 men in March 2002 marked a transition from a tolerant attitude at the plant to one where management had intervened on behalf of the women. Why this should cut off any possibility of damages for conditions that Bright encountered before March 29, 2002, is hard to see. Moreover, Bright contends that management\\'s intervention in March 2002 had limited effect\\x97that the men not only reloaded their computers with graphic sexual images but also blamed Bright and other women for their loss of pay and the embarrassment they had suffered when they had to explain to their wives why they were not going to work for those two weeks. Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition denies these assertions, but, no matter who is right, the main point is that Morgan treats the totality of the working conditions as a single practice. It is inappropriate to draw lines by time (that\\'s Morgan\\'s core holding) or by the particular method that the men used to make working conditions worse for *770 the women than for themselves. So it is not possible to rule out reliance on a particular kind of evidence (such as the pornographic pictures) or a particular time during which the hostile environment was manifest.\\nWhen an employer takes steps such as the suspensions and purge of objectionable material from the computers\\' hard drives, these acts matter not to the duration of the unlawful practice or the evidence a plaintiff may offer, but to the question whether the employer is responsible. Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998), and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998), hold that many unwelcome acts are not imputed to the employer, if it responds reasonably to discriminatory conditions. \"[A]n employer can be liable . . . where its own negligence is a cause of the harassment. An employer is negligent with respect to sexual harassment if it knew or should have known about the conduct and failed to stop it. Negligence sets a minimum standard for employer liability under Title VII\". 524 U.S. at 759, 118 S. Ct. 2257. (Although the Court was writing here about supervisors\\' conduct that did not affect a \"tangible employment action,\" we have used the same approach for the employer\\'s response to coworkers\\' conduct. See, e.g., Dunn v. Washington County Hospital, 429 F.3d 689 (7th Cir.2005); Shafer v. Kal Kan Foods, Inc., 417 F.3d 663 (7th Cir.2005).)\\nHill\\'s Pet Nutrition may be able to show that its handling of the sexual images solved part of the problem and prevents attribution. Similarly it may be able to show that it neither knew nor should have known about some of the events that Bright encountered. If an employee unreasonably fails to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities, and the employer consequently does not know about the problem, then it cannot be held liable. The fact that an employer has raised these contentions, however, does not curtail the scope of the employee\\'s proofs. See Phelan v. Cook County, 463 F.3d 773, 785 (7th Cir.2006). Unless the evidence is so lopsided that the employer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, both the plaintiff and the employer must be allowed to present their full evidentiary cases at trial, and the district judge should instruct on all of these issues. Instruction 3.04 of the Federal Civil Jury Instructions of the Seventh Circuit (2005) is a helpful model.\\nAll of this is so straightforward that the reader must be wondering why we have bothered to recap it in a published opinion. The fact that the district judge balked, in mid-trial, at implementing the Morgan rule is one reason. That Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition has stoutly defended the district court\\'s decision, when it should have confessed error in light of Isaacs (released after this case was tried), is another.\\nAccording to the employer, Isaacs is irrelevant because the facts at the trial of Bright\\'s suit differ from the facts in the summary-judgment record of Isaacs\\'s claim. That the proof differs is true enough; that\\'s inevitable even when two claims arise from the same workplace at roughly the same time. But what has this to do with rules of law? Counsel for Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition appears to believe that rules of law shift from case to case, so that anyone who \"ought\" to win (as Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition is sure that it should) must have the benefit of some favorable legal rule. That approach is nothing less than a challenge to the proposition that there are rules of law at all; it is a claim that every case should be tried \"on its own facts\" in a kind of law-free zone. We doubt that the employer would be so ready to jettison rules that favored its position; no more *771 can it avoid legal rules that favor the plaintiff. Every case will have its own factual pattern, but the law does not change with the facts.\\nHill\\'s Pet Nutrition also insists that the jury must have found Bright and her witnesses not credible. If they were not telling the truth, then Bright loses under any legal rule. But how do we know whether the jury disbelieved Bright\\'s evidence or instead concluded that what happened between March 29, 2002, and the end of Bright\\'s employment in November 2002 was not severe or pervasive enough to support liability under Title VII? The verdict was general; the jury did not give a reason, and we cannot sustain the verdict on the basis of speculation that the jurors had one reason rather than the other. In denying a motion for sanctions, the district judge made it plain that he did not believe Bright, see 2006 WL 2849713, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71371 (S.D.Ind. Sept. 29, 2006), and perhaps this perspective influenced some of the judge\\'s rulings. But a jury is entitled to make its own decision.\\nIsaacs had something for each side. The portion of Isaacs favoring the defendant is its conclusion that Colgate-Palmolive Co., the parent corporation of Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition, is not the \"employer\" of the workers at the Richmond, Indiana, plant and so cannot be liable under Title VII. Just as Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition has refused to accept the portion of Isaacs adverse to its interests, so Bright, represented by the same lawyer as Isaacs, has refused to accept the portion of Isaacs that favors Colgate-Palmolive. What one can say for this obduracy is that Bright (unlike Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition) was not a party to Isaacs and so is not bound by rules of preclusion, though principles of stare decisis remain. But that is all one can say. This portion of Isaacs rested on the proposition that parent corporations are not liable for the wrongs of their subsidiaries unless they cause the wrongful conduct (and so are directly liable) or the conditions of investors\\' liability (\"piercing the corporate veil\") have been satisfied.\\nWe could have cited oodles of decisions for that proposition but chose to cite only one: United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 118 S. Ct. 1876, 141 L. Ed. 2d 43 (1998). The portion of Bright\\'s brief dealing with the claim against Colgate-Palmolive ignores Bestfoods. What it says instead is that Colgate-Palmolive must have been Bright\\'s employer\\x97even though she was hired, paid, and supervised by the staff of Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition\\x97because Colgate-Palmolive promulgated policies that its subsidiaries were supposed to use to comply with Title VII. That a parent corporation has tried to prevent violations of law (the better to protect the value of its investment) hardly makes it directly responsible for those violations! (Bright does not contend that any of the policies that Colgate-Palmolive told its subsidiaries to use directly violated Title VII, counseled unlawful acts, or even increased the probability that unlawful acts would occur.) Nor does it matter that managers at Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition told managers at Colgate-Palmolive about the problems at the Richmond plant. Title VII applies to employers, not to investors who know about what employers are doing. That Bright complained directly to personnel at Colgate-Palmolive does not make it an employer, any more than complaining to a Member of Congress would have made the Senator or Representative her employer. An email to Warren Buffett would not make him personally liable for wrongs committed by corporations in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.\\nThe judgment in favor of Colgate-Palmolive is affirmed. The judgment in favor *772 of Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial.\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 1390387}]"},{"id":384746,"date_filed":"1980-12-05","judges":null,"case_name_full":"24 Fair empl.prac.cas. 897, 24 Empl.

(Pickens-Bond or the Company), a commercial construction contractor with offices in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleging discrimination against the black cement finishers who worked for the Company on the construction of the First National Bank Building in Little Rock from August 1, 1973 to August 31, 1975.1 Following a three-day trial, the district court found that the Company had discriminated against black cement finishers in the assignment of menial and unpleasant tasks, allocation of straight-time and overtime work, layoffs, and promotions to foremen.  The district court awarded both monetary and injunctive relief.  The injunction, in part, ordered the Company to employ essentially equal numbers of black and white cement finishers as foremen for a two-year period and thereafter until the Company promulgated and received court approval of nondiscriminatory objective standards for the promotion of cement finishers to foreman positions.\\n    \\n    \\n      2\\n      On appeal Pickens-Bond contends that the district court erred in the factual findings necessary to the court\\'s determination of liability and, in the alternative, abused its discretion in ordering the limited quota for foreman positions.  Eubanks cross-appeals complaining of the inadequacy of the attorneys\\' fee award and of the trial court\\'s failure to award him monetary damages on an individual basis rather than solely as a member of the class.  We affirm the district court\\'s award of attorneys\\' fees and its determination of liability for discriminatory work assignments, allocation of overtime, and layoffs, but we reverse its finding of discrimination in the promotion of blacks to cement finisher foremen.\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      I. Background.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      Pickens-Bond is a major construction contractor based in Little Rock, Arkansas.  The Company employs a small permanent work force primarily consisting of managerial, supervisory, technical, and clerical workers.  It hires the balance of its work force as needed for particular construction projects.  On January 1, 1973, the Company\\'s permanent work force of 101 employees included three blacks.  On January 1, 1976, four of its 110 permanent employees were black; only one of the four held a supervisory position.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      In the course of constructing the thirty-one floor First National Bank Building and its parking deck, Pickens-Bond employed fifty-seven cement finishers to pour floors and lay steps.  The Company also employed four or five cement finisher foremen to supervise the cement finishers\\' work.  A foreman\\'s responsibility also included the assignment of overtime work to particular cement finishers.  Jack Cooper, the Company\\'s cement finisher superintendent, exercised sole discretion in the appointment of foremen to the project.  Both Cooper and the foremen hired and laid off cement finishers as the requirements of the job dictated.  Neither Cooper nor the foremen used objective criteria in the appointment of foremen, the assignment of overtime, or the laying off of cement finishers.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Primarily on the basis of disputed oral testimony and inferences from statistical evidence susceptible to varying interpretations, the district court concluded that the Company had discriminated against the plaintiff class in making work assignments, in assigning overtime work, in determining layoffs,2 and in promoting cement finishers to foreman positions.  The district court ordered Pickens-Bond to distribute $16,854 to members of the plaintiff class,3 enjoined Pickens-Bond from assigning tasks, jobs, layoffs, or promotions on the basis of race, and required the Company to employ essentially equal numbers of black and white cement finishers as foremen for a two-year period.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      II. Title VII Liability.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      A. Discriminatory Work Assignments, Allocation of Overtime, and Layoffs.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      Pickens-Bond challenges as clearly erroneous the factual findings supporting the district court\\'s determination of liability under Title VII for discrimination in work assignments, assignment of overtime, and layoffs.  The Company chiefly contends that the testimony and statistical evidence adduced at trial belie the district court\\'s findings of unlawful discrimination.  We have carefully reviewed the record in this case and conclude that it supports contradictory inferences.  We cannot say, therefore, that these findings of fact are clearly erroneous.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      With respect to work assignments on the job, the record discloses that after pouring a concrete floor a cement finisher\\'s duties include \"rodding\" (pulling a straight edge), hand troweling, \"jitterbugging\" (tamping down gravel with an instrument called a jitterbug), \"bullfloating\" (smoothing a cement surface with a metal plate attached to a long rod), and running a trowel machine.  The district court found that \"rodding,\" \"jitterbugging,\" and \"bullfloating\" were among the most onerous duties of a cement finisher, and that one foreman on the First National Bank job had discriminatorily assigned these tasks to black cement finishers until the project was nearly completed.4 No witness characterized \"bullfloating\" as an undesirable task, but the testimony of several witnesses supports the finding that black cement finishers were assigned the most menial and unpleasant tasks on the job.  From the record before us, therefore, we cannot say that the district court erred in failing to credit contrary testimony that no cement finishers were assigned specific duties on the job or that black and white cement finishers performed all tasks equally.\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      With respect to the assignment of overtime and determination of layoffs, Pickens-Bond primarily relies on the unrebutted testimony of its statistical expert and the statistical analysis of relevant data proffered by him.  The Company argues that the district court, in computing the wage differential between white and black cement finishers, erroneously included the wages earned by cement finisher foremen who received a fifty-cent per hour premium for their additional responsibilities.  A comparison of the wages earned and number of pay periods worked by white and black cement finishers, omitting foremen, it points out, reveals no significant statistical disparity from which discrimination may be inferred.  Nevertheless, given the district court\\'s findings that Pickens-Bond discriminated against black cement finishers in assigning overtime at undesirable hours, and allowing for the differing inferences to which the statistical evidence was susceptible, the district court did not clearly err in finding the total wage differential attributable to the Company\\'s discriminatory acts.\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      B. Promotion to Foreman.\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      The district court also concluded that Pickens-Bond had discriminated against blacks in the promotion of cement finishers to cement finisher foremen.  In reaching this conclusion, the court found the following evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination:\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      (a) The defendant\\'s permanent work force of 101 employees included only three blacks on January 1, 1973.  By January 1, 1976, four of its 110 employees were black.  Only one of the four blacks was a supervisory employee; that black was a cement finisher foreman.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      (b) Only one black, Robert Brown, Sr., has held a permanent job as a foreman with Pickens-Bond since 1964.\\n    \\n    \\n      16\\n      (c) Pickens-Bond has no objective standards for hiring, layoffs, or promotion to the position of cement finisher foreman.  These foremen were customarily selected by the cement finisher supervisor, Jack Cooper, a white.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      (d) On the First National Bank job, defendant employed 29 black cement finishers, or 50.88% of the total employed, and 28 white cement finishers, or 49.12% of the total employed.  The cement finishing work on the First National Bank job lasted from 1973 to 1975.\\n    \\n    \\n      18\\n      (e) In 1973, defendant employed a total of five cement finisher foremen in Little Rock, Arkansas, one of whom was black; therefore, the percentage of black cement finisher foremen was 20% of the total.  In 1974, defendant employed a total of seven cement finisher foremen in Little Rock, one of whom was black; therefore, the percentage of black cement finisher foremen was 14.29% of the total.  In 1975, defendant employed a total of eight cement finisher foremen in Little Rock, two of whom were black; therefore, the percentage of black cement finisher foremen was 25% of the total.\\n    \\n    \\n      19\\n      (f) Black cement finishers are uniformly as well qualified to be foremen as the white cement finishers.  (Finding of Fact No. 7.)\\n    \\n    \\n      20\\n      Pickens-Bond contends that these findings fail to make out a prima facie case of discriminatory promotions.  We agree.\\n    \\n    \\n      21\\n      The district court first cited as evidence of discrimination the number of blacks on the Company\\'s permanent work force.  The issue here, however, is not the number of blacks serving on Pickens-Bond\\'s permanent work force, but the number of blacks serving as cement finisher foremen on the First National Bank job.  Thus, finding (a) does not directly contribute to the establishment of a prima facie case of discrimination for this plaintiff class.  Moreover, Pickens-Bond maintains a permanent work force that primarily consists of managerial personnel, not construction workers or foremen.  For the 1973-1975 period in question, the Company\\'s permanent work force included only two cement finisher foremen, Jack Cooper (a white) and Robert Brown (a black).  Of those cement finisher foremen on the permanent work force, therefore, an equal number of whites and blacks worked for the Company.  See Plaintiff\\'s Exhibit No. 20, pp. 99-100.  See also Plaintiff\\'s Exhibit No. 6 (Company\\'s permanent personnel on April 17, 1974).\\n    \\n    \\n      22\\n      The district court noted in finding (b) that only one black has held a permanent job as a foreman with Pickens-Bond since 1964.  Because this finding focuses on foremen, it more directly bears on the issue before us.  Again, however, this finding speaks to the number of black foremen on the permanent work force rather than to the number on the First National Bank job.  This finding also addresses a more general question than the one before us by focusing on the number of black foremen rather than on the number of black cement finisher foremen.  As noted above, only a few foremen serve on the Company\\'s permanent work force, and an equal number of blacks and whites served in the two cement finisher foremen positions on the permanent work force for the 1973-1975 period in question and, in fact, since 1968.  See Plaintiff\\'s Exhibit No. 20, pp. 99-100.\\n    \\n    \\n      23\\n      Finding (c), unlike findings (a) and (b), directly focuses on the position of cement finisher foreman.  Nevertheless, the Company\\'s use of subjective criteria in promoting cement finishers to foreman positions does not in itself supply an inference of discrimination.  See Rogers v. International Paper Co., 510 F.2d 1340, 1345 (8th Cir.)  (subjective employment selection standards not unlawful per se), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 423 U.S. 809, 96 S.Ct. 19, 46 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975).  Cf. id. at 1345-46; United States v. N.L. Industries, Inc., 479 F.2d 354, 371-72 (8th Cir. 1973) (use of subjective criteria in awarding promotions relevant to the establishment of prima facie case of discrimination).  In the absence of other evidence of discrimination, the use of subjective criteria does not alone make out a pattern or practice of discrimination.  Likewise, a finding of equal qualifications, as in finding (f), does not alone make out a prima facie case of discrimination in promotions.\\n    \\n    \\n      24\\n      We come, then, to findings (d) and (e) as a foundation for the district court\\'s determination of discriminatory promotions.  The court found that blacks comprised 20% (one of five) of the cement finisher foremen employed by the Company in Little Rock in 1973, 14.29% (one of seven) in 1974, and 25% (two of eight) in 1975.  By comparison, blacks accounted for 50.88% (twenty-nine of fifty-seven) of the cement finishers who worked on the First National Bank job at some time during the three-year project.\\n    \\n    \\n      25\\n      We have previously found statistics to speak loudly in employment discrimination cases.  E.g., United States v. N.L. Industries, Inc., 479 F.2d 354 (8th Cir. 1973); Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 433 F.2d 421 (8th Cir. 1970).  See Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 307-08, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 2741-2742, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (gross statistical disparities alone may in a proper case constitute prima facie proof of discrimination); International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 339, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1856, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977) (statistics competent in proving employment discrimination).  Statistics, however, must be used carefully. \"(T)hey come in infinite variety and, like any other kind of evidence, they may be rebutted.  In short, their usefulness depends on all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.\"  International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, supra, 431 U.S. at 340, 97 S.Ct. at 1856.  Having carefully evaluated the numbers and percentages cited by the district court in the context of this case, we believe that the data fails to establish a prima facie case of discrimination by Pickens-Bond in the promotion of cement finishers to the position of foreman on the First National Bank project.\\n    \\n    \\n      26\\n      In 1973, as the district court noted, only one of five (20%) cement finisher foremen were black.  Two of the five, however, were the only two cement finisher foremen on Pickens-Bond\\'s permanent work force when it began the First National Bank project.  See Plaintiff\\'s Exhibit No. 20, pp. 99-100.  These men Jack Cooper (a white) and Robert Brown (a black) quite naturally would be named foremen on this job, and we find nothing in the record suggesting race as a factor in their selection.  Larry Cooper (a white) obtained his promotion to foreman in 1973 solely because of his familial relationship to Jack Cooper, although nepotism was not pervasive in the Company, not because of his race.  Finding of Fact No. 13.  Thus, the essence of plaintiff\\'s claim of discrimination in 1973 reduces itself to the promotion of two men.\\n    \\n    \\n      27\\n      Of the twenty-two cement finishers (twelve blacks and ten whites) eligible for these positions in 1973,5 two whites were promoted, T. Tyler and O.D. Holland.  We cannot say, however, that the selection of two white cement finishers rather than one white and one black or two blacks establishes a prima facie case of discrimination.  As a practical matter, a difference of one may represent only a random result, not proof of discrimination.  Selection processes characteristically produce short-term results that do not hold true over the long run.  Small deviations from the \"ideal\" number arise naturally and harmlessly in many selection processes operating in a completely even-handed manner.  See generally D. Baldus &amp; J. Cole, Statistical Proof of Discrimination 287-321 (1980); Shoben, Differential Pass-Fail Rates in Employment Testing: Statistical Proof Under Title VII, 91 Harv.L.Rev. 793 (1978).  See also note 10 infra.\\n    \\n    \\n      28\\n      Similarly for those promotions which occurred in 1974, the district court\\'s findings do not establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination.  The court noted that blacks comprised only 14.29% (one of seven) of the cement finisher foremen in 1974.  This percentage statistic, however, is misleading.  The 14.29% figure corresponds to the percentage of black cement finisher foremen employed by Pickens-Bond for all of its Little Rock projects in 1974, not for the First National Bank job alone.  The record indicates that the Company maintained no more than four or five cement finisher foremen on the First National Bank job at any point in time, that two of the foremen in 1973 (both white) left that project in 1974, and that the two foremen selected to take their place were both white.  See note 6 infra.  Thus, the percentage of black foremen on the First National Bank job in 1974 does not differ from that in 1973.\\n    \\n    \\n      29\\n      More importantly, the district court\\'s focus on the number of blacks among all foremen is misplaced.  Because the complaint alleges that Pickens-Bond discriminated in the promotion of blacks to cement finisher foremen, the more telling figure is the number of blacks among the new foremen selected in 1974.  It is for the group of new foremen, i. e., those first promoted to that position in 1974, to which the complaint speaks and in which the observed and expected number of blacks promoted should not differ to a significant degree if race were not a factor in the Company\\'s selection process.  Viewing the employment data from this perspective, we find that Pickens-Bond promoted only two men to the foreman\\'s position in 1974 A.L. Starrett and G. Pater, both of whom were white.  See Defendant\\'s Exhibit No. 8, Attachment 8-4.  At the time of their promotions,6 nine whites and six blacks were eligible for the foreman\\'s position.7 Although two whites were promoted, we again cannot say that a difference of one provides prima facie evidence of employment discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      30\\n      In 1975 Pickens-Bond promoted one black and two white cement finishers from an eligible pool of six blacks and six whites still employed on the First National Bank job at that time.8 As for the years 1973 and 1974, the employment data for 1975 indicates no significant disparity between the number of black and white cement finishers promoted to foremen.  In addition, the three promotions apparently applied to projects other than the First National Bank job.9 Thus, these promotions do not shed light on the promotions to which the complaint speaks those for the First National Bank job.\\n    \\n    \\n      31\\n      Arguably, the promotion of only one black during a three-year period in which seven promotions occurred could provide some evidence of discrimination even if the promotions, when viewed on a year-by-year basis, would not give rise to an inference of discrimination.  Neither the record nor the district court\\'s findings of fact, however, contain any appropriate statistical or legal analysis of the three-year employment data that would permit such an inference to be drawn.  The district court merely stated the actual number and percentage of black foremen for the three years in question and the number and percentage of black cement finishers on the First National Bank job during that period.  To infer a prima facie case of discrimination from these numbers and percentages, the court needed to go beyond presentation of the raw data to application of an appropriate and recognized test for determining the statistical significance of any observed disparity.  See Mayor v. Educational Equality League, 415 U.S. 605, 619-20, 94 S.Ct. 1323, 1332-1333, 39 L.Ed.2d 630 (1974) (rejecting as unreliable \"simplistic percentage comparisons\" of the racial composition of a thirteen-member nominating panel and the population of Philadelphia).  Cf. Hazelwood School District v. United States, supra, 433 U.S. at 308-09 n.14, 97 S.Ct. at 2741-2742 n.14 (standard deviation analysis).  See also D. Baldus &amp; J. Cole, supra at 322-28 (selected methods for calculating tests of statistical significance).  For a number of reasons, moreover, we entertain serious doubt that this case lends itself to reliable statistical analysis.\\n    \\n    \\n      32\\n      First, the promotion of only four cement finishers to foremen for the First National Bank project (or even the entire ten cement finishers employed by the Company as foremen on all of its Little Rock projects from 1973 to 1975) may constitute too small a sample size to establish a prima facie finding of discrimination through statistical analysis.10 See, e. g., Mayor v. Educational Equality League, supra, 415 U.S. at 621, 94 S.Ct. at 1333 (smallness of sample size is important flaw in straight percentage comparisons); Harper v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 525 F.2d 409, 412 (8th Cir. 1975) (\"(S)tatistical evidence derived from an extremely small universe, as in the present case, has little predictive value and must be disregarded.\").  See also Shoben, supra at 801 &amp; n.37 (when the sample size is small, a test based upon the assumption of normality may not be used).  Although a gross statistical disparity may be evidence of discrimination for purposes of Title VII, \"(c)onsiderations such as small sample size may, of course, detract from the value of such evidence.\"  International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, supra, 431 U.S. at 339-40 n.20, 97 S.Ct. at 1856-1857 n.20.  Cf. Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 497 n.17, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 1281 n.17, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977) (large sample of 870).  Here, the promotion of one less or one more black among the seven promotions that occurred during the period in question would result in over a fourteen percent change in the racial composition of the foremen group.  Cf. Mayor v. Educational Equality League, supra, 415 U.S. at 610-11, 94 S.Ct. at 1328-1329 (upholding district court\\'s rejection of data as unreliable, in part, because the change of one position in a thirteen-member panel would alter racial composition by eight percent).\\n    \\n    \\n      33\\n      Second, tests of significance require some assurance of homogeneity among the candidates in the pool from which the selections occurred.  See Shoben, supra at 801.  See also D. Baldus &amp; J. Cole, supra at 181-286 (discussion of the implications of gaps between the assumptions and the characteristics of the data as a recurring problem).  Here, according to some evidence in the record, the pool of cement finishers on the First National Bank job may have included persons who had no interest in the available foreman positions or who lacked sufficient experience or other legitimate credentials to become foremen.11\\n    \\n    \\n      34\\n      In contrast to these threats to the reliability of the data, the record is devoid of any expert analysis on behalf of plaintiff to indicate that discrimination may be inferred from the statistics cited by the district court in its findings.  Although we do not rely on the contrary testimony of the Company\\'s expert witness, the data in this case seems too inconclusive under any analysis to justify an inference of discrimination against blacks in the selection of foremen.\\n    \\n    \\n      35\\n      Moreover, the plaintiff class did not bolster its case with any evidence of specific instances of discrimination against black cement finishers seeking promotion.  Cf. Teamsters v. United States, supra, 431 U.S. at 338, 97 S.Ct. at 1856 (statistical proof of discriminatory pattern-or-practice buttressed by forty specific instances of discrimination); United States v. Hazelwood School District, 534 F.2d 805 (8th Cir. 1976) (showing of specific discrimination against sixteen black applicants for teaching positions), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 433 U.S. 299, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977).\\n    \\n    \\n      36\\n      Accordingly, we hold that the district court\\'s finding that Eubanks and the plaintiff class established a prima facie case of discriminatory promotions must be set aside as without adequate support in the record.  Thus, the relief based on that finding, which requires the assignment of equal numbers of black and white cement finishers to foremen positions, must be vacated.12\\n    \\n    \\n      37\\n      D. Cross-Appeal.\\n    \\n    \\n      38\\n      The district court awarded $15,823.64 in attorneys\\' fees and costs rather than the $29,703.14 requested by plaintiff class.  The court also awarded Eubanks, as the named plaintiff, $904.81 as his apportioned share of the class monetary judgment, but elected not to grant Eubanks additional damages on an individual basis for the specific finding of discrimination against him.  Having reviewed the record, we find no error or abuse of discretion in these rulings and affirm on the issues raised in the cross-appeal.\\n    \\n    \\n      39\\n      III. Conclusion.\\n    \\n    \\n      40\\n      For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the district court\\'s award of attorneys\\' fees and findings of discrimination in work assignments, assignments of overtime, and layoffs, but reverse its finding of discrimination in the promotion of blacks to cement finisher foremen.  Accordingly, we direct the district court on remand to vacate paragraph three of its judgment and order, dated October 23, 1979, and filed October 30, 1979.\\n    \\n    \\n      41\\n      The district court on remand shall also determine and award appellee\/cross-appellant reasonable attorneys\\' fees and seventy-five percent of costs on this appeal.\\n    \\n    \\n      42\\n      Affirmed in part and vacated in part.  Remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n    \\n    \\n      43\\n      McMILLIAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.\\n    \\n    \\n      44\\n      I concur in that part of the majority opinion affirming the district court\\'s finding of employer liability for discriminating on the basis of race in work assignments, allocation of overtime and layoffs and the award of attorneys\\' fees.  Like the majority (see at 1345 n.3), I have reservations about the district court\\'s formula for distribution of the backpay award.  However, as noted by the majority, no party has challenged the distribution formula on appeal.\\n    \\n    \\n      45\\n      For the reasons discussed below, I do not agree that plaintiffs below failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the promotion of cement finisher foremen on the First National Bank project.  In particular, I disagree with the majority\\'s treatment of plaintiffs\\' statistical evidence.  Therefore, I dissent from part II(B) of the majority opinion.\\n    \\n    \\n      46\\n      First, I disagree with the majority\\'s treatment of plaintiffs\\' nonstatistical evidence.  Although I agree that any single factor, such as the use of subjective promotional criteria or a finding of equal qualifications, does not in itself make a prima facie case, I cannot understand why the majority considers and then rejects each factor in isolation in the present case.  Plaintiffs did not seek to establish on the basis of any single factor that the employer was discriminating on the basis of race in promoting or selecting cement finisher foremen.  In my opinion, the employer\\'s management structure and racial composition, the method of promotion, the absence of objective promotional criteria, and a finding of equal qualifications are clearly relevant.  E.g., Rogers v. International Paper Co., 510 F.2d 1340, 1345-46 (8th Cir.), vacated on other grounds, 423 U.S. 809, 96 S.Ct. 19, 46 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975), reinstated with modification on other grounds, 526 F.2d 722 (8th Cir. 1975); United States v. N.L. Industries, Inc., 479 F.2d 354, 367-69 (8th Cir. 1973); Rowe v. General Motors Corp., 457 F.2d 348, 357-59 (5th Cir. 1972).\\n    \\n    \\n      47\\n      The district court found that in 1976 only four of the employer\\'s permanent employees were black (included among the four were the chauffeur and the yardman), only one of the permanent supervisory employees was black (permanent cement finisher foreman Robert Brown, Sr.), the superintendent (who was white) selected the foremen without using objective criteria, the foremen were generally selected from the cement finishers working on the job, all the cement finishers were equally qualified to be foremen, and 51% (28 of 57) of the cement finishers on the First National Bank project were black.  While not conclusive, these factors, especially when considered together, do support the district court\\'s conclusion that a prima facie case had been made.\\n    \\n    \\n      48\\n      Further, I do not agree that plaintiffs necessarily needed to \"bolster\" their evidence with specific instances of racial discrimination in order to make a prima facie case.  Evidence of specific instances of racial discrimination undoubtedly \"(brings) the cold numbers convincingly to life,\" Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 339, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1856, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977), but such evidence certainly is not essential to a prima facie case.  In fact, the \"state of the art\" of employment discrimination law has, in my opinion, evolved considerably beyond the point where plaintiffs are able in most cases to produce specific instances of overt racial discrimination.  Employers, often acting upon the advice of expert legal counsel, will very rarely openly subject plaintiffs to displays of intentional racial discrimination.  I perceive, however, little diminution in employment discrimination.  The violation and the proof of the violation have become more subtle and more sophisticated.  As has been observed elsewhere, \"(i)n many cases the only available avenue of proof is the use of racial statistics to uncover clandestine and covert discrimination by the employer ....\" Teamsters v. United States, supra, 431 U.S. at 340 n.20, 97 S.Ct. at 1857 n.20 (citations omitted).\\n    \\n    \\n      49\\n      I note preliminarily that I would not consider plaintiffs\\' statistical evidence apart from plaintiffs\\' other evidence.  I do not understand plaintiffs\\' case to be based on statistical evidence alone.\\n    \\n    \\n      50\\n      Because this case involves selection of employees, I would begin the analysis by looking at the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 29 C.F.R. Part 1607 (1979).  The Uniform Guidelines have been adopted by the EEOC, the Office of Personnel Management (formerly the Civil Service Commission), the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, and the Treasury Department\\'s Office of Revenue Sharing and incorporate a single set of principles designed to assist employers, labor organizations, employment agencies, and licensing and certification boards in complying with the requirements of federal employment discrimination law. These guidelines were a response by administrative agencies to the unfortunate development of varying and sometimes inconsistent approaches to the problem of discrimination in employee selection.  The Uniform Guidelines attempt to present employer and employee alike with a framework for analysis of at least some kinds of discrimination problems.  I believe consideration of the Uniform Guidelines is critical to the development of some degree of predictability in the enforcement of federal employment discrimination law and to giving employers a tool for judging their own employment practices and complying with the law without active intervention by the government.  The Uniform Guidelines have been adopted not only by one administrative agency but by all those federal agencies having significant responsibility in the area of antidiscrimination law. They are therefore entitled to great deference as a matter of ordinary principles of administrative law. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 433-34, 91 S.Ct. 849, 854-855, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971).\\n    \\n    \\n      51\\n      The Uniform Guidelines contain a helpful \"rule of thumb,\" the \"four-fifths rule\":\\n    \\n    \\n      52\\n      A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths ( 4\/5) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact, while a greater than four-fifths rate will generally not be regarded by Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact .... Greater differences in selection rate may not constitute adverse impact where the differences are based on small numbers and are not statistically significant .... Where the user\\'s evidence concerning the impact of a selection procedure indicates adverse impact but is based upon numbers which are too small to be reliable, evidence concerning the impact of the procedure over a longer period of time and\/or evidence concerning the impact which the selection procedure had when used in the same manner in similar circumstances elsewhere may be considered in determining adverse impact.\\n    \\n    \\n      53\\n      29 C.F.R. &#167; 1607.4(D).\\n    \\n    \\n      54\\n      For purposes of my analysis, I will accept, arguendo, the majority\\'s characterization of the evidence.  I summarize the figures in a table1:I note initially that in each year the differential in selection rates shows discrimination under the four-fifths rule, but in each year a change of only one selection would lead to a different result.  Therefore, taking each year separately, I do not consider the numbers large enough to apply the four-fifths rule meaningfully.  The Uniform Guidelines point to two additional criteria for such cases.  First, the guidelines suggest consideration of the impact of the selection procedure over longer periods of time.  Over the entire three-year period the selection rates for qualified blacks (4.5%) was well below four-fifths of that for qualified whites (24.0%).  Second, the guidelines suggest consideration of \"the impact which the selection procedure had when used in the same manner in similar circumstances elsewhere.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1607.4(D).  The type of \"subjective and ad hoc promotion decisions\" at issue here has been a familiar target in employment discrimination cases.  See Davis v. Califano, 613 F.2d 957, 965-66 &amp; nn.49-51 (D.C. Cir. 1979), citing Rogers v. International Paper Co., supra, 510 F.2d 1340.  This type of promotion procedure is \"highly suspect and must be closely scrutinized because of (its) capacity for masking unlawful bias.\"  Davis v. Califano, supra, 613 F.2d at 965 (footnote omitted).\\n    \\n    \\n      55\\n      I would therefore conclude that the selection rates in this case met the four-fifths rule and were presumptively discriminatory.  The Uniform Guidelines, however, suggest one further step in the analysis: such a difference in selection rates may not be discriminatory if based on small numbers and not statistically significant.  The Uniform Guidelines do not preclude in all cases a finding of discrimination in the absence of a showing of statistical significance, but permit the fact finder to reject the other evidence of discrimination if there is absence of statistical significance.  I observe that this provision would lend itself to treatment as a defense of lack of statistical significance which could be offered by an employer to rebut a four-fifths rule showing, depending on how persuasive the statistics were in showing a high probability that the evidence of discrimination could be explained by non-discriminatory factors.  In this case the statistics suggest, if anything, that the failure to select blacks was unlikely in the absence of discrimination.\\n    \\n    \\n      56\\n      The small amount of data allows only the most rudimentary statistical analysis.  One can say that the proportion of blacks chosen to be foremen is somewhat less than the proportion of blacks among those eligible.  One can say, with the majority, that this discrepancy would not have occurred if in each year one of the white foremen chosen was black.  Finally, if one assumes that race was not a factor at all in the selection process (the \"null hypothesis\" approach), one can calculate the probability that the selections would have occurred as they did: a chance of about 20 in 100 (one in five) that two whites would be chosen in 1973, a chance of about 35 in 100 (one in three) that two whites would be chosen in 1974, and a 50-50 chance of choosing at least two whites in 1975.  The chance that no more than one black would be chosen and that the one black choice would occur in the final year is about 3.4 in 100; the chance that no more than one black would be chosen among the seven choices during the whole period is about 6 in 100.2\\n    \\n    \\n      57\\n      In my view there is no doubt that this data supports quite strongly the inference that discrimination took place.  The majority makes much of the fact that we are only looking at two promotions a year in 1975 and 1976: that is, if one of the two foremen selected had been black, the percentages would thus indicate no discrimination.  But the fact is that all four of the foremen selected were white.  None of the four selected was black.  The employer could have selected black foremen but did not.\\n    \\n    \\n      58\\n      What is the \"significance\" of this data?  The concept of statistical \"significance\" is one that seems particularly susceptible to misunderstanding.  The critical question is, of course, significant for what purpose?  Social scientists regard a hypothesis as true if it shows less than a 5% or perhaps 1% chance of error; they then regard a statistical test of the data confirming a hypothesis to a 95% or 99% certainty as scientifically true.  Businesses sometimes disregard as much as a 10% chance of error in deciding whether a hypothesis is a valid basis for action.  See T. Dyckman &amp; J. Thomas, Fundamental Statistics for Business &amp; Economics 366-471 (1977).  In a court of law in my view there is no arbitrary cutoff point for statistical significance; while statistics regarded by social scientists as sufficient to prove a fact are obviously entitled to great weight, less definite statistical results also have some significance, especially in light of other circumstances.3\\n    \\n    \\n      59\\n      Here the hypothesis is that the employer did (or did not) discriminate in promotions. Assuming that promotions were made by totally race neutral means from the pool of qualified employees, there is only about a 6% chance of one or fewer blacks being chosen.  Moreover, there is less than a 4% chance that no more than one black foreman would be chosen and that that one black foreman would be chosen in the third and final year of the project.  These probabilities tend to confirm the district court\\'s conclusion that discrimination took place.\\n    \\n    \\n      60\\n      This approach only measures the probability of discrimination under a random selection procedure, as if the selection had been made by picking names out of a hat.  To me it is evident that this assumption underestimates the probability of discrimination.  Employers do not pull names out of hats.  When the job started this employer had a permanent workforce of more than 100 that was white except for a black yardman, a black chauffeur and one black job foreman.  The foremen it had when it started the job were white with the exception of the one black permanent foreman.  The first two years of the job, the employer selected all white foremen.  Therefore, not only does the promotion data meet the test of showing less than a 5% chance of nondiscriminatory selection, but the data is part of a broader pattern indicative of discrimination.  Therefore, although the number of selections is few, I have a great deal of difficulty with the majority\\'s emphasis on the small number of promotions as a weakness in plaintiffs\\' case.\\n    \\n    \\n      61\\n      \"Title VII tolerates no discrimination, subtle or otherwise.\"  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 801, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1823, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).4 True, there is no open discrimination in promotion here.  Considering each single promotion decision separately and considering the whole pattern in isolation from the persuasive national experience of racial discrimination in employment that gave rise to the need for Title VII, each promotion decision appears innocuous enough.  But the district court looked at the whole picture in finding these promotions discriminatory.  I would affirm the district court\\'s judgment.5\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n         Eubanks, a former employee of Pickens-Bond, alleged violations of section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981 (1976), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e to 2000e-16 (1976) (amended 1978)\\n        Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2), the District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas certified the plaintiff class as consisting of all black cement finishers who worked for Pickens-Bond on the First National Bank job from August 1, 1973 to August 31, 1975.  In its judgment and order, the district court identified the members of the class in conformity with Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c) (3).\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         The district court also found that Pickens-Bond had discriminated against Eubanks in laying him off. See Finding of Fact No. 11\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         The district court ordered the distribution to proceed according to a formula under which those black cement finishers who worked longest on the project would be compensated most.  Although this distribution has the seeming irony of awarding the greatest sums to those least injured by the Company\\'s discrimination, no party challenges the formula on appeal.  To some extent the formula compensates for discrimination in work assignments on the job\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         The district court also found that Pickens-Bond then \"changed the practice and required that work be equitably assigned.\"  (Finding of Fact No. 9.)\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         Although 57 cement finishers ultimately worked on the three-year project, only 29 had been employed by the end of 1973.  Of these 29, Jack Cooper, Robert Brown, and Larry Cooper must be excluded from consideration for the two foremen promotions in question because they already held that rank.  Four additional men should be excluded from consideration because they were transferred to another job on the same day they were hired for the First National Bank project\\n        For purposes of this discussion, we have assumed that the pool of candidates eligible for promotion to foreman consists of those cement finishers employed on the First National Bank job, even though it is possible that there may have been persons who were eligible and considered for the foreman position who were not on-site workers.  This assumption, however, is consistent with the district court\\'s comparison of the number of black foremen to the number of black cement finishers on this project in finding a prima facie case of discrimination.  We also recognize that these figures may be underinclusive of the number of cement finishers eligible for promotion to the extent that the Company\\'s discrimination in work assignments, allocation of overtime, and layoffs may have affected the number of finishers, black and white, still on the job when it came time for awarding promotions.  This effect, however, is speculative on the record of this case and the district court itself did not consider or rely upon other discriminatory acts in formulating its percentage figures or making its percentage comparisons of black foremen and black cement finishers.  See also note 13 infra.\\n      \\n      \\n        6\\n         The exact date that Pickens-Bond promoted Starrett and Pater is not entirely clear from the record.  We may reasonably infer, however, that because the Company would need a fairly constant number of foremen throughout the job, these promotions occurred in March of 1974 when two of the 1973 foremen, T. Tyler and L. Cooper, transferred to another project.  See Defendant\\'s Exhibit No. 17.  This inference also finds support in another exhibit, which indicates that Pater worked as a nonsupervisory employee for only two weeks from the date he was first hired for the First National Bank job, March 13, 1974.  See Defendant\\'s Exhibit No. 14\\n      \\n      \\n        7\\n         These figures assume that only those cement finishers who worked on the job before Pickens-Bond hired Starrett and Pater were eligible for the two positions.  See note 5 supra.  If we include all cement finishers who worked on the First National Bank job at any time in 1974, the work force eligible for promotion would consist of 13 whites and 11 blacks.  See Defendant\\'s Exhibit No. 17\\n        As before, see note 5 supra, these numbers exclude those workers who had been laid off, transferred to another project, or already named foreman before the vacancies arose.\\n      \\n      \\n        8\\n         Pickens-Bond may have promoted a fourth foreman in 1975, R. Brown, Sr., (a black cement finisher) but the record is not entirely clear whether he and the \"R. Brown\" listed as foreman in 1973 and 1974 are the same person.  See Defendant\\'s Exhibit No. 17.  The denomination of \"Sr.\" after the name and the listing of both a R. Brown, Sr., and R. Brown, Jr., on the list of cement finishers employed on the First National Bank job in 1975 may or may not refer to the same individual\\n        Given the uncertainty in the record and our analysis that a difference of one is not statistically significant, however, we have not considered him to be an additional promotion for purposes of this discussion.  Our approach, moreover, casts the district court findings in their most favorable light, for the promotion of R. Brown, Sr., would mean that the Company promoted two blacks and two whites in 1975 instead of one black and two whites.\\n      \\n      \\n        9\\n         Defendant\\'s Exhibit No. 8, Attachment 8-4, indicates that the new foremen in 1975 consisted of L.M. Weddell (a white), J. Shaw (a black), and D. Fultz (a white).  Weddell\\'s name, however, does not appear on the payroll list of those cement finishers employed on the First National Bank job.  Shaw\\'s name appears on the list, but this list indicates that he had been transferred to another project in Little Rock before 1975.  Fultz\\'s name also appears on the payroll, but the list indicates that he worked on the First National Bank job only one week before transferring to another project.  Compare Defendant\\'s Exhibit No. 8, Attachment 8-4, with Defendant\\'s Exhibit 17\\n      \\n      \\n        10\\n         For a discussion of the small sample problem as a source of unpredictability, instability, and variability in selection processes, see D. Baldus &amp; J. Cole, supra at 297-303\\n        Even in a selection process which is completely neutral as to group status, * * * intangible influences may in the short run produce results suggesting bias, when the long-run result would be a perfectly evenhanded treatment of minorities.  For example, assume four black and four white women with equal formal qualifications applied for three positions as a personal secretary with a corporate official, and 1 black and 2 whites were hired.  The small numbers of applicants would lend but little support to the proposition that the results reflected bias on the defendant\\'s part rather than reflecting the impact of subjective and impressionistic factors which would favor neither blacks (n)or whites over the long run.  (Id. at 299.)\\n      \\n      \\n        11\\n         (W)hen the assumptions of randomness or representativeness are challenged, proper interpretation requires a preliminary inquiry into the degree to which the data in fact fail to meet the assumption at issue.  (D. Baldus &amp; J. Cole, supra at 289-90 (emphasis in original).)\\n      \\n      \\n        12\\n         Although we have determined that plaintiff did not make out a prima facie case of discriminatory promotions, we leave intact another portion of the order that enjoins the Company from assigning work, laying off, and promoting cement finishers on the basis of race.  This employment remedy may be justified by the discrimination found in the Company\\'s work practices in general\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         The majority points out that these figures may not truly represent those employees who sought promotion, because it is not established in the record that all qualified employees wanted to be foremen.  Although I agree this deficiency may reduce slightly the probative value of the data, I do not think it warrants disregarding it.  The evidence was that all of the qualified employees were eligible for promotion.  There is no reason to suppose that black employees would be any less likely to accept a promotion and a pay increase than white employees\\n        Finally, the data rests on assumptions that minimize any discrimination shown.  For example, three whites were promoted in 1973, not two as the table shows.  The majority disregards the third because he was promoted on the basis of his familial relationship to a management employee.  See at 1347.  The majority considers this reason for promotion nondiscriminatory, despite the fact that management was nearly all white, so that the use of nepotism as a criteria for promotion would have an obvious discriminatory impact.  Thus, these data are conservative and may well omit factors which would strengthen the support for the district court\\'s finding of discrimination.\\n              Cement finishers        Cement finishers  Total foremen\\nYear  eligible for promotion  promoted          employed\\n1973  12 black                0 black           1 black\\n      10 white                2 white           4 white\\n1974   6 black                0 black           1 black\\n       9 white                2 white           6 white\\n1975   6 black                1 black           2 black\\n       6 white                2 white           6 white\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         The \"conditional probability\" that two successive events will occur is the product of the probabilities of each occurrence.  See J. Freund, Modern Elementary Statistics 134-40 (1973); T. Wonnacott &amp; R. Wonnacott, Introductory Statistics 40-41 (1969).  The probability of selecting the first white foremen in 1973 from a pool of 10 whites and 12 blacks was  10\/22; the probability of selecting a second white from a pool of 9 whites and 12 blacks was  9\/21; and the probability of selecting 2 whites was  90\/462 or about 20%.  Other probabilities were similarly computed\\n        I have not used the formula for \"standard deviation\" set forth by the Supreme Court in Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 311 n.17, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 2743 n.17, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977), and Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 496-97 n.17, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 1281-1282 n.17, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977).  That formula was developed to estimate probabilities in cases involving large numbers.  But if the numbers are small enough, an exact computation, rather than the \"standard deviation\" analysis, should be used.  See D. Baldus &amp; J. Cole, Statistical Proof of Discrimination 323 (1980).  The \"standard deviation\" analysis has built into it certain approximations which are insignificant in analyzing large numbers and simplify enormously the calculation of the probability of a given result.  As the sample gets smaller, the appoximations built into the analysis increasingly affect the significance of the result, while the calculation of an exact result becomes simpler.  See also note 3 infra.\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Until approximately 1978, the statistical analysis in employment discrimination cases was \"largely intuitive.\"  Mitchell v. Rose, 570 F.2d 129, 133 n.4 (6th Cir. 1978) (jury discrimination case).  However, two footnotes in two 1977 Supreme Court cases seem to have launched the lower courts upon what I would describe as an unnecessarily narrow course.  Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, supra, 433 U.S. at 311 n.17, 97 S.Ct. at 2743 n.17; Castaneda v. Partida, supra, 430 U.S. at 496-97 n.17, 97 S.Ct. at 1281-1282 n.17; see, e. g., EEOC v. United Virginia Bank\/Seaboard Nat\\'l, 615 F.2d 147, 149-54 (4th Cir. 1980); Gay v. Waiters\\' and Dairy Lunchmen\\'s Union, Local No. 30, 489 F.Supp. 282, 307-11 (N.D.Cal.1980).  Recently, a panel of this Circuit used a statistical significance\/standard deviation type analysis in Hameed v. Iron Workers Local 396, 637 F.2d 506 (8th Cir. 1980) (large sample, applicant flow data).  In my opinion, undue emphasis on \"statistically significant\" employment disparities under the \"standard deviation\" analysis in order to make a prima facie case constitutes yet another barrier of proof in the case of small samples, as in the present case, or in the case of large samples when there is \"some\" minority representation.  See, e. g., Mayor v. Educational Equality League, 415 U.S. 605, 619-21, 94 S.Ct. 1323, 1332-1334, 39 L.Ed.2d 630 (1974) (sample of thirteen); Adams v. Reed, 567 F.2d 1283, 1287 (5th Cir. 1978) (sample of five); Turner v. Texas Instruments, Inc., 555 F.2d 1251, 1257 (5th Cir. 1977) (sample of eight); Harper v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 525 F.2d 409, 412 (8th Cir. 1975) (sample of five).  But cf. Bilingual Bicultural Coalition v. FCC, 595 F.2d 621, 648 n.84 (D.C.Cir.1978) (en banc) (Robinson, J., dissenting in part) (\"As a general matter, the value of a statistical showing depends not merely upon the size of the sample but also upon the extent of the expected observation and the degree of disparity element unknowable until the commission looks at the particular group\\'s statistics.  In short, as the application of the logic of statistics that it purports to be, the court\\'s conclusion that statistics for small groups are always unreliable is simply wrong.\").  See also note 2 supra\\n        I read neither Castaneda nor Hazelwood to mandate a statistical significance\/standard deviation type analysis in all cases regardless of the appropriateness of their use.  In fact, the last sentence in footnote 17 in Hazelwood states: \"These (statistical significance) observations are not intended to suggest that precise calculations of statistical significance are necessary in employing statistical proof, but merely to highlight the importance of the choice of the relevant labor market area.\" 433 U.S. at 311-12 n.17, 97 S.Ct. at 2743-2744 n.17 (definition of relevant labor market at issue).\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         Although this case seems to me to involve disparate impact of the employer\\'s selection procedures on black employees, the evidence may also be susceptible to analysis under the McDonnell Douglas test for race-based disparate treatment.  In 1973 and 1974, black employees were in the pool of qualified employees and were in effect among those treated as job applicants, in each case the applicant was not chosen and instead a white applicant was chosen.  Although it is true that the employer considered at the same time the entire pool of employees qualified for promotion and the position did not remain open after rejection of the black applicants, the fact is that the black applicants were passed over and similarly situated white employees were chosen for a job that had been held by whites in overproportion to their presence among qualified persons.  See Furnco Constr. Co. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 579, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2945, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978) (relevance of statistics in McDonnell Douglas disparate treatment case).  The selection of a black through the same procedure in 1975 would, of course, be evidence that discriminatory intent was not the sole determinant for the selection of foremen.  But the question in a disparate treatment case is whether discriminatory intent was a factor in the selection process, not whether race was the only factor.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 282 n.10, 96 S.Ct. 2574, 2580 n.10, 49 L.Ed.2d 493 (1976)\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         Given the evidently nondiscriminatory posture of the employer with respect to hiring (51% of the cement finishers on the First National Bank project were black; 37% of the journeymen finishers\/plasterers in the Little Rock SMSA were black), I would have, however, favored a less intrusive remedy for the promotion-to-foreman discrimination than the hiring order devised by the district court\\n      \\n    \\n    ', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 384746}]"},{"id":342263,"date_filed":"1977-03-04","judges":"Clark, Fay, Goldberg","case_name_full":"14 Fair empl.prac.cas. 721, 13 Empl.

Plaintiff brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981 and &#167; 1983 on April 28, 1976, seeking reinstatement and an award of back pay.  The district court dismissed the &#167; 1983 suit because it found insufficient allegations that defendant, a private Alabama corporation, was operating under color of state law. Ingram does not challenge this decision.  The district court dismissed the &#167; 1981 cause of action because Ingram had failed to comply with the one year statute of limitations prescribed by Alabama law for \"(a) ctions for any injury to the person or rights of another, not arising from contract . . .\" Ala.Code tit. 7, &#167; 26.1 On appeal, Ingram does not contest the principle that state limitations statutes circumscribe his federal claim under &#167; 1981; rather, he argues that the district court applied the wrong limitations provision.\\n    \\n    I. The Shavian Guideposts\\n    \\n      2\\n      Federal courts must look in the first instance to the applicable state statute of limitations in actions for back pay or similar damages under a federal statute for which Congress failed to provide limitations period.  See  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988; O\\'Sullivan v. Felix,233 U.S. 318, 34 S. Ct. 596, 58 L. Ed. 980 (1914); Beard v. Stephens, 372 F.2d 685, 688 (5th Cir. 1967).\\n    \\n    \\n      3\\n      Whether it should be inferred from Congressional silence that Congress intended that state limitations periods be applied at all is a matter that has perhaps unfortunately troubled historians more than judges.  See Note, A Limitation on Action for Deprivations of Federal Rights, 68 Colum.L.Rev. 763 (1968).  Instead, the question of selecting one from among many possible state limitations provisions has been, for better or worse, the focus of judicial attention.\\n    \\n    \\n      4\\n      To be sure, in deciding the period governing &#167; 1983 we have occasionally heeded the principle that our choice of a state statute of limitations must be based on which statute will best effectuate the Congressional policies underlying &#167; 1983.  Thus, in Franklin v. City of Marks, 439 F.2d 665, 669 (5th Cir. 1971), the court refused to be bound by a state statute of limitations so short (10 days) that it impinged on policies underlying &#167; 1983.  We have dealt with the abnormal case such as Franklin,, however, without articulating our reasons for applying state law in the normal case.  Moreover, in the normal case we have quickly abandoned the pretence that our reason for selecting one among many state limitations provisions is that it best serves federal interests.\\n    \\n    \\n      5\\n      For example, one line of cases advises that the choice of a state limitations provision is a matter of determining based on federal law the \"essential nature\" of the federal claim, and then of determining under state law which limitation period would be applicable to a state claim of the same general category.  See Bell v. Aerodex, Inc., 473 F.2d 869, 971 (5th Cir. 1973); Franklin v. City of Marks, supra, 439 F.2d at 669-70; McGuire v. Baker, 421 F.2d 895, 898 (5th Cir. 1970).  A second line of cases advises that the choice of a limitations period is based on how a state court applying state law would categorize the action for relief.  See Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 495 F.2d 398, 405 (5th Cir. 1974), rev\\'d in part on other grounds, 424 U.S. 747, 96 S. Ct. 1251, 47 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1976); Knowles v. Carson, 419 F.2d 369 (5th Cir. 1969).  Even the first line of cases tends, in practice, to rely heavily on state law in categorizing the claim presented, however, so that references to federal law even in this line tend to be of little import.  Federal interests are thus generally subordinated to a mechanical application of state law.\\n    \\n    \\n      6\\n      Two recent cases in this circuit, Shaw v. Garrison, 545 F.2d 980 (5th Cir. 1977), and Shaw v. McCorkle, 537 F.2d 1289 (5th Cir. 1976), help provide the guideposts in this area.  Shaw v. McCorkle analyzes the two lines of cases adverted to above and concludes that in determining which state statute of limitations applies to an action under &#167; 1983, a federal court should determine first how the state court would categorize the action and then which state limitation period would apply to the action so categorized.\\n    \\n    \\n      7\\n      Shaw v. Garrison addressed the question whether state survivorship law or federal common law determined if a &#167; 1983 plaintiff\\'s death prior to trial caused his civil rights claim to abate.  The court reasoned that since application of state survival law to the facts of that case would leave plaintiff without a remedy in either federal or state court, the state survivorship law was inconsistent with the broad remedial purposes embodied in the Civil Rights Acts.  The court concluded that where state law proves to be an unsuitable vehicle to provide the relief envisioned by &#167; 1983, the federal courts may look beyond the inhospitable law. It held that as a matter of federal common law the civil rights action survived in favor of plaintiff\\'s estate.  The Garrison court thus gave full effect to the principle often ignored in the statutes of limitations cases that where resort to state law is had to fill the interstices in federal provisions creating substantive rights, the touchstone must be whether a particular state statute effectuates the Congressional policies underlying the federal acts.\\n    \\n    \\n      8\\n      Nonetheless Shaw v. Garrison draws a critical distinction that tells us why the principle of Shaw v. McCorkle controls our treatment of the case at bar.  Quoting from the lower court opinion, 391 F. Supp. 1353, the court distinguished between statutes regulating survival, which may entirely bar plaintiffs from ever filing suit, and statutes of limitations, which merely regulate the permissible time for filing suit.2 Because the hardship worked by the former is much more severe than that occasioned by the latter, inhospitable state limitations provisions will carry greater weight than inhospitable survivorship provisions, and in the normal case recourse the state limitations law will be dispositive.  If federal interests are affected, they are not so severely restricted when the state limitations provision applies that we need fear the definition of those interests in state terms for purposes of choosing the applicable statute of limitations.\\n    \\n    \\n      9\\n      With these guideposts before us, our next task is to decide which Alabama statute of limitations would be applied had this or a similar action been brought in state court.\\n    \\n    \\n      10\\n      II. Contract or Tort?\\n    \\n    \\n      11\\n      Appellant incorrectly asserts that the district court decision was based on Ala.Code tit. 7, &#167; 26(1), which prescribes a one year period for recovery of wages.3 This court held &#167; 26(1) to be unconstitutional with respect to back pay actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act in Caldwell v. Alabama Dry Dock, 161 F.2d 83 (5th Cir. 1947).  To begin with, the continued vitality of Caldwell is questionable.4 More important, the district court opinion cannot reasonably be construed as relying on &#167; 26(1).  We need not discuss whether that court could have relied on &#167; 26(1), and if so whether it should have done so.  Rather, we confine ourselves to the question whether the lower court erred in applying &#167; 26, because under either &#167; 26(1) or &#167; 26 the one year statute of limitations would preclude Ingram\\'s suit in the case at bar.5\\n    \\n    \\n      12\\n      The appellant urges that the ostensible unconstitutionality of &#167; 26(1) leaves open the field for the Alabama statutes of general application for actions based on implied and written contracts, which bear respective six and three year limitations.  See Ala.Code tit. 7, &#167;&#167; 21, 24.  The district court applied the one year provision in Ala.Code tit. 7, &#167; 26, applicable to tort actions not arising from a contract or specifically enumerated rights.  Our choice among these statutes will be determined by whether an action for reinstatement and back pay for the employer\\'s discharge of an employee for constitutionally prohibited reasons constitutes an action based on a contract (ex contractu ) or on a right arising independently of the parties\\' agreement (ex delicto ).\\n    \\n    \\n      13\\n      We think it clear that under the circumstances of this case Ingram\\'s assertion of his rights under &#167; 1981 and the fourteenth amendment arose independently of any agreement between him and his employer.  Consequently his action was ex delicto, and the district court properly applied &#167; 26.\\n    \\n    \\n      14\\n      We are aware that there is some conflicting authority.  Compare Buckner v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 476 F.2d 1287 (5th Cir. 1973), adopting lower court opinion and aff\\'q 339 F. Supp. 1108, 1118 (N.D.Ala.1972) (applicable statute of limitations in &#167; 1981 suit is &#167; 26 because action is essentially ex delicto ); with Boudreaux v. Baton Rouge Marine Contracting Co., 437 F.2d 1011, 1017 n.16 (5th Cir. 1971) (dictum that action under &#167; 1981 is essentially ex contractu ).  We think the analysis in Buckner is superior, and we should in any event be bound to the holding in that case, as opposed to the dictum in Boudreaux.  Moreover, the approach taken in Buckner reflects the approach adumbrated in Shaw v. McCorkle, supra.  In Boudreaux, the court categorizes the federal right in federal terms as one designed to \"make and enforce contracts.\"  That is of course true, but it is inconsistent with the McCorkle court\\'s suggestion that a federal court substantially rely on state law in categorizing the essential nature of the claim presented.\\n    \\n    \\n      15\\n      The Buckner court may be said to have relied on this categorization of the federal right in state terms.  It bases its decision not on the language of &#167; 1981 but rather on whether the right arose from a breach of promise or from a statutory duty independently of what the parties may or may not have agreed. 339 F. Supp. at 1118.  See generally Chambers v. Birmingham Trust &amp; Savings Co., 232 Ala. 609, 168 So. 893 (1936).  Answering this question in the affirmative, the court properly concludes that &#167; 1981 is analogous to an ex delicto action in Alabama courts.  The conclusion is both sound and entirely consistent with prior and subsequent authority.  See Watkins v. Scott Paper Co., supra, 530 F.2d at 1196-97 (assuming Caldwell still applies, district court correctly limited Title VII action by &#167; 26); EEOC v. Griffin Wheel Co., 511 F.2d 456, 458 n.4 (5th Cir. 1975) (applicable limitation period in Title VII back pay suit is &#167; 26); Sewell v. Grand Lodge of International Association of Machinists, 445 F.2d 545 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1024, 92 S. Ct. 674, 30 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1972) (&#167; 26 applies to complaint under Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 401, et seq., alleging wrongful discharge from union position for exercise of first amendment rights).\\n    \\n    III. Conclusion\\n    \\n      16\\n      It borders on the solecistic to legislate a federal cause of action cognizable in federal courts, but migrate to the states for a time limitation based on state law. Not only might the variations in limitations provisions among the states encourage forum shopping, but the stricture that federal courts choose among various state statutes engenders the confusion that often results when a federal court wanders about in alien state territory.  Most important, of course, the uncertainty about which limitations provision applies affords inadequate notice to potential plaintiffs.  Were we in the beginning, we might for the sake of uniformity argue for a federal common law limitation.  We are not writing on a tabula rasa, however, but are the heirs of precedent.  The precedent is clear.  Absent a common law limitation concept the federal courts were adrift.  They found refuge in analogous state limitations provisions, there being no other place to go.  The conclusion we must bear is neither rational nor historical, but purely precedential.\\n    \\n    \\n      17\\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n        *\\n         Rule 18, 5 Cir.; Isbell Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I\\n      \\n      \\n        1\\n         Section 26 provides in part:\\n        The following must be commenced within one year:\\n        Actions for any injury to the person or rights of another, not arising from contract, and not herein specifically enumerated.\\n      \\n      \\n        2\\n         This distinction has initial plausibility but needs to be more tightly drawn.  That is, a statute regulating survivorship may also be conceptualized as regulating merely the permissible time for filing suit, the difference being that the period ends with plaintiff\\'s death rather than with a pre-established date.  The real difference is that a survivorship statute may foreclose the claim of a plaintiff who, like Shaw, timely files suit but dies before trial, whereas a statute of limitations penalizes only a plaintiff who, like Ingram, fails even to file suit within the prescribed time\\n      \\n      \\n        3\\n         Section 26(1) provides:\\n        All suits and actions for the recovery of wages, overtime, damages, fees or penalties accruing under laws respecting the payment of wages, overtime, damages, fees and penalties, and specifically under the act of congress known as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as same has been or may hereafter be amended, and all other similar acts shall be brought within one year after the accrual of such cause of action, and all such causes of action accruing prior to the date hereof shall be brought within one year after the passage of this section.  This section shall not affect suits pending at the time of its passage.\\n      \\n      \\n        4\\n         In Caldwell we held that &#167; 26(1) was unconstitutional because the statute \"discriminate(d) against rights and causes of action arising under a valid federal statute.\" 161 F.2d at 85.  At the time of our decision, there were no laws regarding wages and hours or similar matters in the state of Alabama.  Consequently the effect of &#167; 26(1) was to discriminate against federal causes of action, specifically those under the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Alabama has subsequently enacted a minimum wage law with respect to public contractors.  See Ala.Code tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 385(8)-(24).  We therefore recognized in Watkins v. Scott Paper Co., 530 F.2d 1159, 1196 (5th Cir. 1976), that the rationale of Caldwell has been undermined\\n      \\n      \\n        5\\n         United States v. Georgia Power Co., 474 F.2d 906 (5th Cir. 1973), a Title VII case, suggests that we should apply \"the appropriate state statute of limitations governing actions for unpaid wages\" when a plaintiff sues under a federal law creating a right to back pay as part of general remedial relief.  Assuming arguendo that &#167; 26(1) would be constitutional as applied, we need not decide whether &#167; 26(1) would therefore be preferred to &#167; 26 as the applicable statute of limitations in an action for reinstatement and back pay under &#167; 1981, as well as under Title VII.  See Watkins v. Scott Paper Co., supra, 530 F.2d at 1196; Pettway v.

Lewis\\' (\"Lewis\") complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which the court can grant relief. For the reasons that follow, the court grants defendants\\' motion.\\n\\nI. BACKGROUND\\n\\nLewis filed a four-count complaint against defendants. Count One, against Cotton, alleges sexual harassment and constructive discharge in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17. Count Two, against Ameritech, also alleges sexual harassment and constructive discharge in violation of Title VII. Count Three, against Cotton, alleges a state law claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Count Four, against Ameritech, also alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress.\\nDefendants moved to dismiss Counts One, Three, and Four. The court dismissed Count One on February 8, 1996, because a supervisor is not an \"employer\" that can be sued under Title VII. (See Minute Order dated February 8, 1996.) Thus, only defendants\\' motion to dismiss the state law claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress is now before the court.\\n\\nII. DISCUSSION\\n\\n\\nA. Standard for deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss\\n\\nWhen deciding a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court must accept all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Ellsworth v. City of Racine, 774 F.2d 182, 184 (7th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1047, 106 S. Ct. 1265, 89 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1986). If, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the court must dismiss the case. See FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b)(6); Gomez v. Illinois State Board of Educ., 811 F.2d 1030, 1039 (7th Cir.1987). However, the court may dismiss the complaint only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 102, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957).\\n\\nB. Failure to state claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress\\n\\nAmeritech and Cotton contend that Counts Three and Four must be dismissed because Lewis fails to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\\n*1118 Under Illinois law, the elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are as follows: 1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendants; 2) intent to cause, or a reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; 3) severe or extreme emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff; and 4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by defendants\\' outrageous conduct. Hamros v. Bethany Homes and Methodist Hosp. of Chicago, 894 F. Supp. 1176, 1180 (N.D.Ill.1995) (citing Public Finance Corp. v. Davis, 66 Ill. 2d 85, 89-90, 4 Ill. Dec. 652, 654, 360 N.E.2d 765, 767 (1976)).\\nTo be actionable, the conduct alleged must be particularly egregious.\\n`\"It has not been enough that the defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that he has intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that his conduct has been characterized by \"malice\" or a degree of aggravation which would entitle plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort. Liability has been found [only when the conduct] is so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all bounds of decency.\"\\'\\nHamros, 894 F.Supp. at 1180 (quoting Davis, 66 Ill.2d at 89-90, 4 Ill. Dec. at 654, 360 N.E.2d at 767 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 cmt. d (1965))). Furthermore, \"`\"[t]he law intervenes only where the distress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.\"\\'\" Harriston v. Chicago Tribune Co., 992 F.2d 697, 703 (7th Cir.1993) (quoting Davis, 66 Ill.2d at 89-90, 4 Ill. Dec. at 654, 360 N.E.2d at 767 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 cmt. j (1965))).\\nThe court judges the facts of each particular case by an objective standard to determine whether the alleged conduct was extreme and outrageous. Harriston, 992 F.2d at 703 (citing Schroeder v. Lufthansa German Airlines, 875 F.2d 613, 623 (7th Cir.1989)).\\nIn the present case, Lewis\\' complaint wholly fails to allege conduct sufficiently egregious to constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress. In Count Three, Lewis alleges primarily that Cotton\\'s discriminatory conduct against Lewis consisted of her giving him an unjustified poor performance review and placing him on a \"Performance Action Plan,\" presumably because he was male. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) In Count Four, Lewis alleges that despite his having performed his duties consistent with Ameritech\\'s established performance standards, he received a poor performance review and was placed on a \"Performance Action Plan.\" (Compl. \u00b6 28.) Lewis alleges that he notified Cotton\\'s supervisor that he was subjected to verbal harassment, an unjustified and unsubstantiated performance review, and intentional emotional distress, but that no remedial action was taken. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.)\\nThis conduct described by Lewis in no way can be considered to be \"so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all bounds of decency,\" or to cause distress so severe that a reasonable person could not be expected to endure it. Davis, 66 Ill.2d at 89-90, 4 Ill. Dec. at 654, 360 N.E.2d at 767. See also Harriston, 992 F.2d at 703 (affirming dismissal of intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because conduct alleged was not so severe that a reasonable person could not be expected to endure it and did not go beyond all bounds of decency).\\nIn fact, the conduct alleged by the plaintiff in Harriston, which the Seventh Circuit found not to reach the level of extreme and outrageous conduct, was far more egregious than the conduct alleged by Lewis. In Harriston, the plaintiff alleged, among other things, that she was not allowed to supervise white subordinates; was reprimanded for no reason; was forced out of her management position; was excluded from office activities; was falsely accused of having poor sales; was threatened with discipline; had her telephone calls monitored through the use of an eavesdropping device; and had her car damaged and vandalized on several occasions in defendant\\'s parking lot. Id. at 703. If the foregoing is not extreme and outrageous conduct, then neither is a poor performance review, even an unjustified one.\\n*1119 Moreover, because defendants\\' allegedly tortious behavior occurred in the employment setting, Illinois law \"strictly demands\" that Lewis show that defendants engaged in \"extreme and outrageous behavior.\" See Hamros, 894 F.Supp. at 1180. \"`In employment situations, personality conflicts, job performance evaluations, or job transfers are unavoidable and often result in stress. However, if such stress formed the basis for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, virtually every employee would have a cause of action.\\'\" Hamros, 894 F.Supp. at 1180 (quoting Miller v. Equitable Life Assurance Society, 181 Ill.App.3d 954, 957, 130 Ill. Dec. 558, 560, 537 N.E.2d 887, 889 (1st Dist.1989)). Instead of clearly showing extreme and outrageous behavior by defendants, Lewis\\' complaint appears to allege the type of situation against which Hamros and Miller warn.\\nLewis\\' complaint also fails to allege the necessary state of mind of the defendants to hold them liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Lewis alleges that Cotton created and Ameritech condoned a hostile and intolerable work environment, and thereby caused Lewis to suffer serious emotional distress, which was \"reasonably foreseeable\" to Cotton and Ameritech. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 32.) Thus, Lewis\\' complaint itself precludes his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. A defendant must intend to cause, or recklessly disregard the probability of causing, emotional distress. See Hamros, 894 F.Supp. at 1180 (citing Davis, 66 Ill.2d at 89-90, 4 Ill. Dec. at 654, 360 N.E.2d at 767). It is not enough that the defendant\\'s causing emotional distress to the plaintiff was simply \"reasonably foreseeable\" to the defendant, as Lewis alleges.\\nLewis\\' conclusory allegations that Cotton\\'s discriminatory conduct was \"intentional, willful, reckless, extreme and outrageous,\" (Compl. \u00b6 25), and that Ameritech\\'s \"intentional acts of harassment and discrimination\" caused Lewis severe emotional distress, do not save his complaint. \"Even under the liberal notice pleading standards of the Federal Rules, a complaint must nonetheless state a cause of action. To do so it must allege all the elements of the particular cause of action.\" Hamros, 894 F.Supp. at 1180 (citing Estate of Cassara v. State of Illinois, 853 F. Supp. 273, 276 (N.D.Ill.1994) (complaint must state either direct or inferential allegations concerning all material elements necessary to recover under the relevant legal theory)).\\nBeyond Lewis\\' conclusory allegations, nothing in Count Three or Four supports a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Thus, Lewis has failed to meet even the liberal notice pleading standards under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\\nAccordingly, the court finds that Lewis has failed to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and therefore grants defendants\\' motion to dismiss Counts Three and Four.\\nAmeritech also contends that Count Four must be dismissed because the Illinois Worker\\'s Compensation Act, 820 ILCS 305\/1-305\/30, provides the exclusive remedy for a plaintiff to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Because the court already has decided that Count Four fails to state a claim, the court need not address this argument.\\n\\nIII. CONCLUSION\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court grants defendants\\' motion to dismiss, and dismisses Counts Three and Four of plaintiff\\'s complaint. Because no counts remain against Cotton, she is dismissed from the case as a party-defendant.\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 1397579}]"},{"id":1399562,"date_filed":"1995-04-27","judges":"Ponsor","case_name_full":"Debra DESROSIERS, Plaintiff, v. the GREAT ATLANTIC & PACIFIC TEA COMPANY, INC. and Alfred Gregori, Defendants","opinions":"[{'author_str': 'Ponsor', 'per_curiam': False, 'type': '010combined', 'page_count': None, 'download_url': None, 'author_id': 2592, 'opinion_text': '\\n885 F.Supp. 308 (1995)\\nDebra DESROSIERS, Plaintiff,\\nv.\\nThe GREAT ATLANTIC &amp; PACIFIC TEA COMPANY, INC. and Alfred Gregori, Defendants.\\nCiv.

McIntyre.\\n\\nMEMORANDUM RECONSIDERING DEFENDANTS\\' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\\n\\n(Docket No. 61)\\nPONSOR, District Judge.\\n\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe purpose of this memorandum is to reconsider defendants\\' motion for summary judgment, which the court previously denied in its entirety. Defendants\\' motion to reconsider has focused the court\\'s attention on the \"continuing violation\" doctrine set forth in Sabree v. United Broth. of Carpenters and Joiners Local 33, 921 F.2d 396 (1st Cir.1990). It is now clear that a cluster of plaintiff\\'s claims \\x97 for sexual harassment \\x97 cannot stand when considered in light of the standard set forth in Sabree and related cases.\\nUpon reconsideration, the court will therefore allow defendants\\' motion with regard to Desrosiers\\' claims of sexual harassment (Counts II, IV, VI and VIII). These claims are time-barred since the last act of sexual harassment took place more than six months prior to plaintiff\\'s filing of a claim with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. However, defendant has not presented new arguments, additional facts or case law sufficient to persuade the court to change its original ruling on the remaining counts for wrongful termination and retaliation. Consequently, plaintiff may proceed with her remaining claims pursuant to both Title VII and Mass.Gen.L. ch. 151B.\\nThe court\\'s reasoning is set forth below.\\n\\nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\\n\\nAs required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, the undisputed facts are summarized in a light most favorable to the nonmovant.\\nThe plaintiff, Debra Desrosiers was employed as a clerk in A &amp; P\\'s Grocery Merchandising Department from August of 1990 until she was laid off in March of 1993. She alleges that from the time she was hired, Alfred Gregori, Vice President of Merchandising for A &amp; P, created a sexually hostile work environment, by routinely propositioning her and subjecting her to unwelcome, *311 sexually offensive comments. Gregori\\'s improper conduct continued until May 1992, despite the fact that Desrosiers repeatedly reported these incidents to her supervisor, Frank White, then A &amp; P\\'s Grocery Coordinator.\\nIn May of 1992, Desrosiers formally complained about Gregori\\'s sexual harassment to Rob Steubner, A &amp; P\\'s Personnel Director and to Ed Lyle, the company\\'s Director of Loss Prevention. It is undisputed that at that point all harassment of a sexual nature ceased.\\nHowever, even after May 1992, Gregori did begin to intimidate and harass Desrosiers in nonsexual ways, making it impossible for her to properly do her work. Desrosiers was terminated in March, 1993, ten months after she formally complained to Steubner of Gregori\\'s sexual harassment. Gregori\\'s employment with A &amp; P ended in September of 1993.\\nPlaintiff alleges that she was terminated because she complained about Gregori\\'s sexual harassment. In September, 1993, plaintiff filed a charge of sex discrimination against the defendants with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\"). On January 13, 1994, Desrosiers filed a twelve-count complaint against A &amp; P and Gregori alleging gender-based discrimination (Counts I, III, V and VII), sexual harassment (Counts II, IV, VI and VIII), and retaliatory discharge (Counts XI and XII), each in violation of Title VII and Mass. Gen.L. ch. 151B. Plaintiff also alleges that defendants\\' sexual harassment violated Mass. Gen.L. ch. 214, \u00a7 1C (Counts IX and X).\\nBecause Desrosiers did not file her claim with the MCAD until September, 1993 the only purportedly discriminatory act that falls within the applicable statutory time frame is her termination in March, 1993. Desrosiers does not dispute that she may only recover damages for the earlier discriminatory acts by arguing that they constitute a continuing violation.\\n\\nIII. SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND THE CONTINUING VIOLATION DOCTRINE\\n\\nThe timeliness of the filing of a Title VII or ch. 151B discrimination claim may be properly considered under Rule 56 \"if the relevant facts are sufficiently clear.\" Sabree v. United Broth. of Carpenters and Joiners, 921 F.2d 396, 399 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 520 (1st Cir.1990).\\nThe initial requirement for a Title VII \"timely filing\" is that the plaintiff must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. See Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d at 520. In a deferral state, such as Massachusetts, a state with its own civil rights statute and agency, Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e), requires that a plaintiff file the charge with the appropriate state agency within 240 days of the discriminatory act and with the EEOC within 300 days of the act[1].\\nId., citing Mack v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 181 (1st Cir.1989); Cajigas v. Banco de Ponce, 741 F.2d 464, 467 (1st Cir.1984).\\nIn Sabree, the First Circuit explained that a continuing violation \"is composed of a number of discriminatory acts emanating from the same discriminatory animus, each act constituting a separate wrong actionable under Title VII.\" Id. at 400. In order for the violation to be actionable, at least one act in the series must fall within the limitations period. Id.; Mack, 871 F.2d at 183. The issue here, as in Sabree, is \"not whether there is an act sufficient to support a violation that occurred within the limitations period, but whether the acts outside of the limitations period may be relied upon in awarding a remedy, such as back pay\" or, in this instance, emotional distress damages. Id. at 401.\\nUnder Title VII, in order for a plaintiff to reach back and recover for discriminatory acts outside the limitations period, a \"substantial relationship\" between the timely and untimely acts must be proven. *312 Id. The most important factor to be considered in determining whether a substantial relationship exists is whether the act outside the limitations period has \"the degree of permanence which should trigger an employee\\'s awareness and duty to assert his or her rights.\" Id. at 402, quoting Berry v. Board of Supervisors of L.S.U., 715 F.2d 971, 980 (5th Cir.1983), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 868, 107 S.Ct. 232, 93 L.Ed.2d 158 (1986).\\nPermanence is basically an inquiry into what the plaintiff knew or should have known at the time of the discriminatory act. What matters is whether, when and to what extent the plaintiff was on inquiry notice.\\nId.\\nIf the untimely act has the requisite degree of permanence, then it is not substantially related to the act which occurred within the limitations period and there can be no continuing violation. In other words, once a plaintiff has \"lived through a series of acts and is thereby able to perceive the overall discriminatory pattern,\" she is on inquiry notice and has a duty to assert her rights. Sabree at 402, citing Cajigas v. Banco de Ponce, 741 F.2d at 470; Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d at 522.\\nChapter 151B also permits a plaintiff to recover for a continuing violation. Mass. Gen.L. ch. 151B, \u00a7 5; Rock v. Mass. Comm. Against Discrimination, 384 Mass. 198, 207-208, 424 N.E.2d 244 (1981); see also Lynn Teachers Union, Local 1037 v. Mass. Comm. Against Discrimination, 406 Mass. 515, 521 and n. 7, 549 N.E.2d 97 (1990). The MCAD Rules of Procedure codify the continuing violation rule: \"the six month requirement shall not be a bar to filing in those instances where facts are alleged which indicate that the unlawful conduct complained of is of a continued nature.\" 804 CMR 1.03(2). Pursuant to ch. 151B, \u00a7 5, the cause of action accrues \"on the happening of an event likely to put the plaintiff on notice.\" Wheatley v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, 418 Mass. 394, 397, 636 N.E.2d 265 (1994); Lajoie v. General Electric Company, 1993 WL 343678 at *4 (D.Mass. August 17, 1993), citing Ching v. Mitre Corp., 921 F.2d 11, 14 (1st Cir.1990) (for a continuing violation, the six-month filing period begins when the \"plaintiff learns of the alleged discriminatory act.\")\\n\\nIV. DISCUSSION\\n\\nPlaintiff has argued that her sexual harassment claims were timely filed because the sexual harassment prior to May, 1992, the non-sexual harassment after May, 1992 and her termination in March, 1993 are all inextricably intertwined. She maintains that the last acts of sexual harassment by Gregori that occurred in May 1992 \\x97 almost two years before she filed her complaint with the MCAD and obviously outside the MCAD\\'s six-month window for filing discrimination claims and the EEOC\\'s 300-day filing deadline \\x97 are not time barred because they were the beginning of an unbroken chain of harassing conduct on the part of her former employer. Desrosiers thus now contends that her claim of sexual harassment spans more than two years and constitutes a continuing or serial violation of state and federal anti-discrimination law. The weakness in plaintiff\\'s argument is both factual and doctrinal.\\nAccepting plaintiff\\'s version of the facts, there may well have been a causal relationship between Gregori\\'s sexual harassment of Desrosiers, and Gregori\\'s subsequent non-sexual harassment and plaintiff\\'s termination ten months later. However, under the continuing violation standard of Title VII (as set forth in Sabree) or ch. 151B, causal relationship by itself is not enough. Sabree explains that the critical inquiry is whether plaintiff knew or should have known that she was being discriminated against when the untimely act occurred. If the plaintiff was aware of the discrimination, she cannot avoid the strict statute of limitations. Sabree v. United Broth. of Carpenters, 921 F.2d at 402.\\nIt is beyond dispute that Desrosiers knew she was being sexually harassed. She repeatedly complained and reported this harassment to Frank White, her supervisor. When this proved to be of no avail, she then reported Gregori\\'s misconduct to Rob Steubner. There can be no argument that Desrosiers *313 was not on \"inquiry notice\" of the hostile work environment created by Gregori\\'s untoward behavior. See Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d at 522.\\nPlaintiff also argues that \"the discriminatory acts taken against Ms. Desrosiers were not permanent until she was involuntarily terminated from employment.\" Plaintiff\\'s Opposition to Defendants\\' Motion for Reconsideration at 6. She further argues that \"requiring victims of sexual harassment to fully understand first that sexual harassment constitutes a form of discrimination based on gender and the inappropriate conduct is `permanent\\' is unrealistic.\" Id. Plaintiff\\'s construction of the continuing violation rule misconstrues the nature of the cognizable harms which can result from sexual harassment and the First Circuit\\'s use of the term \"permanence.\"\\nA plaintiff has a cause of action arising from sexual harassment if the illegal conduct alters the terms or conditions of employment. The unlawful conduct may cause a cognizable injury and therefore be \"permanent\" even if a plaintiff is not terminated, demoted or formally reprimanded. It is the creation of a hostile work environment that makes sexual harassment actionable. Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., ___ U.S. ___, ___, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993).\\nIf the victim of sexual harassment perceives the unlawful conduct as undesirable and complains to a supervisor, asking that the harassment cease, she must know the conduct is discriminatory. The day in, day out sexual harassment allegedly experienced by Desrosiers in this case constituted a discrete pattern of discriminatory conduct distinct from the subsequent non-sexual harassment and her ultimate termination. These facts permit only one possible conclusion: that Desrosiers knew by May 1992 that Gregori\\'s conduct was improper and unlawful. She therefore had a duty to assert her rights as to these violations in a timely manner. See Berry v. Board of Supervisors of L.S.U., 715 F.2d at 981.\\nThe continuing violation standard of ch. 151B does not provide for a different result. Desrosiers learned of the discriminatory act, i.e. the alleged pattern of sexual harassment by at least May, 1992 when she reported it to Steubner. See Lajoie v. General Electric Company, 1993 WL 343678 at *4.\\nThe thematic relationship between the sexual harassment and the later retaliation and termination is not sufficient to make out a \"continuing violation\" on the facts of this case, as a matter of law. While the court sympathizes with plaintiff, it would be false generosity to permit the case to go forward on facts that are insufficient, with the certainty that the untimely counts will be thrown out on appeal.\\nIn sum, plaintiff\\'s claims of retaliation and wrongful termination under Title VII and ch. 151B may go forward. But Desrosiers may not be compensated for the injury she might have suffered solely as a result of sexual harassment.\\n\\nV. CONCLUSION\\n\\nDefendants\\' motion for reconsideration is hereby ALLOWED with respect to plaintiff\\'s claims for sexual harassment (Counts II, IV, VI and VIII). The motion to reconsider is DENIED as to all other counts of the complaint. The motion to file an interlocutory appeal is DENIED.\\nSUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM AND ORDER REGARDING DEFENDANTS\\' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\\n\\n(Docket No. 61)\\nOn April 24, 1995, this court issued an Order and accompanying Memorandum granting defendants\\' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff\\'s sexual harassment claims brought pursuant to Title VII and Mass.Gen.L. ch. 151B.\\nPlaintiff also brought her claims of sexual harassment under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 214 \u00a7 1C (Counts IX and X). The court\\'s order did not expressly address whether these counts were governed by its ruling. The purpose of this memorandum is to confirm that summary judgment will enter for defendants also on the claims of sexual harassment pursuant to ch. 214 \u00a7 1C.\\n*314 It is settled law that where ch. 151B is applicable it provides the sole state law remedy for sexual discrimination in the workplace. Charland v. Muzi Motors, Inc., 417 Mass. 580, 586, 631 N.E.2d 555 (1994) (citing cases). Massachusetts appellate courts have strictly followed the rule that a plaintiff cannot circumvent the strict statute of limitations in ch. 151B by seeking refuge in an alternative statutory scheme. See e.g. Mouradian v. General Electric Co., 23 Mass. App. 538, 503 N.E.2d 1318 (1987). It appears settled that ch. 214 \u00a7 1C is a supplemental \\x97 not an alternative \\x97 remedy for sexual harassment and may be invoked only where ch. 151B is inapplicable. See Agin v. Federal White Cement, Inc., 417 Mass. 669, 670-671, 632 N.E.2d 1197 (1994). Moreover, even if ch. 214 \u00a7 1C was found to be an alternative remedy in some circumstances, there is no authority that would permit a plaintiff to use ch. 214 \u00a7 1C to evade filing a timely complaint of discrimination with the MCAD as required by ch. 151B. See Charland v. Muzi Motors, Inc., 417 Mass. at 584-585, 631 N.E.2d 555. Here, as the court has already noted, Desrosiers plainly did not file a timely complaint of sexual harassment with the Commission.\\nTherefore, defendants\\' motion for summary judgment as to Counts IX and X of the complaint is ALLOWED.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 151B, \u00a7 5 requires that complaints must be filed within six months after the discriminatory act.\\n\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 1399562}]"},{"id":1400048,"date_filed":"1980-05-02","judges":"Lasker","case_name_full":"Alberta GILINSKY, Plaintiff, v.

Balsam, James P. Blake, New York City, Carol Kroch, of counsel.\\nLASKER, District Judge.\\nAlberta Gilinsky sues Columbia University and several of its officials (collectively, Columbia) on behalf of herself and all other women similarly situated. She alleges that she was denied appointment as a visiting professor of psychology for the academic year 1972-73 and as a tenured professor for the following year in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, Executive Order 11246, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\\nGilinsky\\'s individual action was first tried before the New York State Division of Human Rights. Commissioner Sable found that Columbia had not discriminated against Gilinsky because of her sex. His finding was eventually upheld by the New York Court of Appeals. 39 N.Y.2d 612, 385 N.Y.S.2d 19, 350 N.E.2d 396 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1096, 97 S.Ct. 1112, 51 L.Ed.2d 543 (1977). The record of the state proceedings was admitted into evidence at the trial of this action during which additional testimony was taken.[1]\\n\\nI. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment Claims\\nColumbia moved at the close of the presentation of Gilinsky\\'s case to dismiss the claims under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments on the grounds that the requisite state action had not been proven.[2]\\nGilinsky argues that state action is present under the analysis set forth in Weise v. Syracuse University, 522 F.2d 397, 407 (2d Cir. 1975) (quoting Jackson v. Statler Foundation, 496 F.2d 623, 629 (2d Cir. 1974)). The rule set forth in Weise is that:\\n\"[F]ive factors [are] to be weighed in considering state action claims:\\n(1) the degree to which the `private\\' organization is dependent on governmental aid; (2) the extent and intrusiveness of the governmental regulatory scheme; (3) whether that scheme connotes government approval of the activity or whether the assistance is merely provided to all without such connotation; (4) the extent to which the organization serves a public function or acts as a surrogate for the State; (5) whether the organization has legitimate claims to recognition as a `private\\' organization in associational or other constitutional terms.\" *1312 Gilinsky argues that she has met the demands of this formula because (1) Columbia receives substantial federal and state financial funding and grants; (2) Columbia is subject to state laws prohibiting sex discrimination; (3) the state has tacitly approved Columbia\\'s discriminatory practices; (4) Columbia provides college and university courses; and (5) Columbia has harmed the public by committing the wrongs alleged here.\\nThe only factor arguably present here is the first, the receipt of financial assistance. As to the others, merely being subject to the laws of the State or the United States is clearly insufficient to show that action in violation of those laws is state action. Similarly, \"tacit\" approval by the State does not convert action by a private party into state action. By providing higher education, Columbia may place itself before the public eye and attain a measure of public influence, but it does not thereby act as a surrogate of the State in the performance of its educational mission. Indeed, in today\\'s market, it is a competitor in the sale of its services with such institutions as the City University of New York and the State University of New York.\\nAs to Columbia\\'s receipt of public funds, it is unnecessary, for the purpose of determining whether its action is state action, to scrutinize the degree to which it is dependent on federal and state funding. Without a showing that the State or federal government was \"`involved . . . with the activity that caused the injury,\\'\" government support is insufficient to establish state action. Weise v. Syracuse University, supra, 522 F.2d at 405 (quoting Powe v. Miles, 407 F.2d 73, 81 (2d Cir. 1968)). As noted by Judge Frankel in another case involving Columbia,\\n\"receipt of money from the State is not, without a good deal more, enough to make the recipient an agency or instrumentality of the Government. Otherwise, all kinds of contractors and enterprises, increasingly dependent upon government business for much larger proportions of income than those here in question, would find themselves charged with `state action\\' in the performance of all kinds of functions we still consider and treat as essentially `private\\' for all presently relevant purposes.\"\\nGrossner v. Trustees of Columbia University, 287 F.Supp. 535, 547-48 (S.D.N.Y.1968).\\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss the claims under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments is granted.\\n\\nII. The Class Claim\\nColumbia moved at trial to dismiss the claim of discrimination against the class[3] arguing that hiring statistics establish that the Department of Psychology has not discriminated against women since Title VII became applicable to Columbia in 1972.\\nGilinsky bases the class claim \"upon Columbia\\'s own statistics and documents to prove the pattern or practice of disparate treatment of women in hiring by the Psychology Department both pre- and post-Act.\" (Letter from Plaintiff\\'s Attorney, November 7, 1979). Those statistics, which are both pre- and post-1972, show that as to tenured faculty, the Psychology Department had no tenured women until it appointed one in academic year 1977-1978, and that that appointment raised the percentage of tenured women in the department from zero to nine. As to nontenured faculty, in 1972, the Department had one woman out of a total of six (or 16.66%) nontenured professors, compared to 28% women at Columbia\\'s \"Feeder\" School Pool, and in 1978, two out of seventeen nontenured faculty appointments were women.[4]\\n*1313 These statistics are obviously heavily influenced by the pre-1972 hiring practices of the department since the only post-1972 statistics on which Gilinsky relies are cumulative, and represent the net result of hiring practices that extended well before 1972.\\nHowever, the probative value of pre-1972 statistics is at best minimal. Since the 1972 amendments to Title VII making it applicable to educational institutions did not alter substantive rights retroactively, Weise v. Syracuse University, supra, 522 F.2d at 411, prior to that time \"[Columbia] University was free, as far as Title VII was concerned, to discriminate in its employment practices.\" Id. at 410.\\nAs the Supreme Court stated in Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 309, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 2742, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977) (footnote omitted),\\n\"A public employer who from that date forward made all its employment decisions in a wholly nondiscriminatory way would not violate Title VII even if it had formerly maintained an all-white work force by purposefully excluding Negroes.\"\\nThe Court clarified the weight to be given to pre-1972 statistics:\\n\"This is not to say that evidence of pre-Act discrimination can never have any probative force. Proof that an employer engaged in racial discrimination prior to the effective date of Title VII might in some circumstances support the inference that such discrimination continued, particularly where relevant aspects of the decisionmaking process had undergone little change.\"\\nId. at 309 n. 15, 97 S.Ct. at 2742 n. 15.\\nHere it is stipulated that since the date Title VII became effective as to Columbia five out of the nine faculty appointments made by the Psychology Department have gone to women, including one out of the two tenured appointments.[5] Proposed Joint Pre-Trial Order \u00b6 24. The statistics simply do not establish that the Department has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against women as a class in the period since it has been covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Rather they create a presumption that the Department has not discriminated against women and Gilinsky has shown no other evidence (such as a heavy preponderance of applications from women) that would rebut that presumption.\\nAccordingly, the motion to dismiss the class action is granted.\\n\\nIII. Gilinsky\\'s Individual Claim\\nThe parties agree that Gilinsky\\'s individual claim is controlled by McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) and that to prove her prima facie case, she must show\\n\"(i) that [s]he belongs to a [sexual] minority; (ii) that [s]he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite [her] qualifications, [s]he was rejected; and (iv) that, after [her] rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant\\'s qualifications.\"\\nId. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824 (footnote omitted). If Gilinsky proves a prima facie case of sex discrimination, the burden then shifts to Columbia to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for its failure to hire her, and Gilinsky then bears the burden of demonstrating that this reason is pretext. Id.\\n\\n\\n*1314 A. Prima Facie Case\\n\\nThere is no dispute that Gilinsky belongs (in this case) to a sexual minority or that, despite her qualifications, she was \"rejected\" for appointment. However, for reasons indicated below, we find that she has not proven the second and fourth McDonnell elements. She contends that the appointment of Donald Hood to a tenured position in the Department of Psychology two years after her application was rejected establishes both that Columbia was seeking to fill the same position for which she applied and that the position remained open after her rejection. Columbia answers that Hood was appointed because (1) his area of expertise was in physiological psychology \\x97 an area the department needed to build at the time, while Gilinsky\\'s was in sensation and perception, (2) he had held a nontenured position in the department for five years, and (3) he was rated as more qualified than Gilinsky by outside evaluators.\\n\\n\\n1. The Second McDonnell Element\\n\\nGilinsky contends that she has demonstrated that Columbia was seeking applications from professors with her qualifications by establishing that she applied at the suggestion of Professor Herbert Terrace, a member of the personnel search committee for the department of psychology (Tr. 66, 74; St. Tr. 61-62), that a vacancy existed in the department (St. Tr. 685-86), and that she was qualified to fill that position as demonstrated by her curriculum vitae (Plaintiff\\'s Exhibit 30).\\nHowever, that a member of the department\\'s search committee suggested she apply in 1968 does not establish that Columbia was seeking applications from professors for the 1971-1972 academic year at issue here. In fact, the evidence shows otherwise. First, the parties have stipulated that no recommendations for tenured positions were made for the 1972-1973 and 1973-1974 academic years and no appointment to the position of visiting professor was made for the 1972-1973 academic year (Proposed Joint Pre-Trial Order \u00b6\u00b6 20, 21).\\nSecond, the evidence establishes that the department was not seeking to make a tenured appointment either of someone from outside Columbia or in the area of Gilinsky\\'s expertise sensation and perception. Dr. Julian Hochberg, chairman of the department during academic years 1972-1973 through 1973-1974 (Tr. 95) testified:\\n\"[W]e neither felt we should nor in fact that we could make any tenured appointments from outside in any of those areas [of social personality and sensation perception].\\n(Tr. 154). His statement is supported by documentary evidence, including the minutes of a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Psychology Department on April 11, 1972 (St. Tr. 689), a letter from John A. Nevin, Chairman of the Psychology Department to Dr. George K. Fraenkel, Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences dated June 4, 1971 (Defendants\\' Exhibit XX) and another letter to Dean Fraenkel from Nevin and Hochberg dated June 14, 1972 (Defendants\\' Exhibit ZZ), both of which outline the anticipated needs of the department. The 1972 letter states:\\n\"As far as tenured positions are concerned: Tenured appointments drawn from outside the University are not presently anticipated in the Social-Personality area, nor in Sensation-Perception.\"\\n(p. 2), indicating a position that had not shifted over the previous year:\\nOur present areas of strength are learning, perception and cognition, and social psychology. We also have some strength in sensory psychology and physiological psychology. It is our judgment that we must maintain our strength in all these areas, with the exception that we should not appoint another sensory psychologist to replace Clarance Graham when he retires.\"\\n(Defendants\\' Exhibit XX, p. 7).\\nMoreover, when a tenured position became vacant, the department\\'s policy at the time was, for financial reasons, to make non-tenured appointments (Tr. 108, 157). Indeed, the very document (a memorandum from the Office of the Dean to the Department *1315 of Psychology dated November 24, 1971) to which Gilinsky points as establishing the existence of the vacancy created by the death of Professor Clarence Graham specifies that\\n\"The appointment should be made at the beginning associate-professor level, either by promotion from the non-tenure ranks or by appointment from outside the University. It is not anticipated that authorization for this appointment can take effect before the 1974-75 academic year.\"\\n(St. Tr. 685). Clearly, the department was not seeking to appoint a tenured professor from outside the University whose specialization was in the area of sensation and perception.\\nGilinsky argues that the decision of the department, as evidenced by the minutes of the meeting held on her application (which record discussion to the effect that the department did not need her because it was sufficiently strong in sensation and perception) (St. Tr. 689-91) was an attempt to \"pigeon hole\" her into a field narrower than her capability. The evidence shows that the department had sought to expand its strength in the area of physiological psychology. As articulated by the 1971 and 1972 department chairmen,\\n\". . . appointments in the following areas are needed either for maintenance of strength or to fill some need for support: Physiological ...\"\\nLetter from John A. Nevin and Julian Hochberg to Dean Fraenkel, June 14, 1972, p. 2 (Defendants\\' Exhibit ZZ), and\\n\"[W]e should make two assistant professor appointments in areas that seem to us to hold great promise for the immediate future, and\/or meet certain teaching needs.\\n1. Human infancy. . . .\\n2. Quantitative methods and computor models. . . .\\n3. If it becomes possible to make an additional appointment, we should strengthen the area of physiological psychology currently represented by Woods and Hood.\"\\nLetter from John A. Nevin to Dean Fraenkel, June 4, 1971, pp. 7-8 (Defendants\\' Exhibit XX). Two years after Gilinsky\\'s application was rejected, Donald Hood, whose expertise was in physiological psychology (Tr. 127-28; Hood\\'s curriculum vitae, Defendants\\' Exhibit 000-1) was appointed to tenure (Proposed Joint Pre-Trial Order . 23). Gilinsky contends that she was capable of filling that position, but she has offered no evidence to counter Hochberg\\'s testimony (Tr. 163), which is supported by her curriculum vitae (Plaintiff\\'s Exhibit 30), that her area of specialization was sensation and perception.\\nIt is true that Gilinsky believed herself to be qualified. During her cross examination, the following exchange occurred:\\n\"Q Dr. Gilinsky, if a university or an institute was looking for someone with expertise in physiological methods as well as perhaps knowledge elsewhere, but really looking for knowledge and expertise in physiological matter, would you consider yourself a candidate to teach graduate students?\\nA Yes. As a matter of fact I will be teaching a course in physiological methods next term.\\nQ Despite the fact you have never done any published work or experiments which I specifically asked you, in the area of physiology, that you would be capable of teaching advanced graduate students in that area?\\nA Yes.\\nQ What would qualify you to do that? If someone were looking at your vitae, what would they look to then, to perceive that you were qualified to teach these physiological methods?\\nA I think there are three answers to your question. One is my very large breadth of experience and knowledge and ability to learn quickly so the techniques which I haven\\'t had hands-on experience, I would be able to very quickly learn and become skillful at. That\\'s number one.\"\\n(Tr. 57-58). However, that the members of the psychology department considering Gilinsky\\'s application declined to draw the *1316 suggested inference that Gilinsky was qualified to teach physiological methods to graduate students is not surprising. The argumentation by Gilinsky does not refute Hochberg\\'s testimony, which is supported by Gilinsky\\'s curriculum vitae, that Gilinsky\\'s area of specialization at the time was in perception and sensation. (Tr. 163; Plaintiff\\'s Exhibit 30).[6]\\n\\n\\n2. The Fourth McDonnell Element\\n\\nAs to the fourth McDonnell element, Gilinsky argues that the appointment of Donald Hood to a tenured position in the department establishes that the position for which she applied remained open and subsequently was given to a man. However, as indicated above, the evidence shows that Hood was a specialist in physiological psychology (Tr. 126-28) which, as just discussed, Gilinsky was not. Moreover, Hood had held a non-tenured position in the department since 1969 (Proposed Joint Pre-Trial Order \u00b6 23), teaching graduate students courses in physiological methods (Tr. 128), which was an area the department wanted to build (Tr. 129; Defendants\\' Exhibit XX, p. 8). Thus, the position filled by and the status of Hood \\x97 that of a professor of physiological psychology drawn from within the department \\x97 met the department\\'s needs and requirements while the position for which Gilinsky applied and was qualified and her status did not.\\nAlthough we find that Gilinsky was not \"qualified\" (within the meaning of McDonnell) for the position to which Hood was appointed, that finding does not diminish the impression made by Gilinsky\\'s testimony at trial and her curriculum vitae that she is eminently qualified as a university level professor of psychology.\\n\\nB. Columbia\\'s Nondiscriminatory Reason\\nSince Gilinsky has not proven a prima facie case, it is unnecessary to inquire further into Columbia\\'s reasons for appointing Hood instead of her to a tenured position. Nevertheless, even if Gilinsky had satisfied her prima facie burden of proof, Columbia has established a nondiscriminatory, legitimate reason for its decision, and Gilinsky has offered no evidence that the decisional basis was a pretext for discriminatory motives. The same reason for concluding that the position to which Hood was appointed was not one for which Gilinsky was qualified supports the conclusion that Columbia\\'s reasons for appointing Hood were nondiscriminatory, that is that it preferred to appoint a professor who had worked in the department since 1969 teaching graduate students and working in an area which the department wanted to build rather than a professor from outside Columbia who had not demonstrated an expertise in that area. Furthermore, the opinions solicited from outside Columbia on Hood\\'s candidacy were unanimously favorable, and, when comparing him to Gilinsky, rated him as a better candidate.[7]\\n*1317 We conclude that Columbia did not discriminate against Gilinsky because of her sex in refusing to appoint her to a visiting or tenured position in the department of psychology, and accordingly the complaint is dismissed.\\nIt is so ordered.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  References to the testimony taken at this trial is indicated by \"Tr.\" and to the state proceedings by \"St. Tr.\"\\n\\nGilinsky seeks to admit into evidence certain documents identified as Plaintiff\\'s Exhibits 37, 62-62(h), 63-63(d), 83, 92, and 101(a). Although the documents are admissible, Columbia is correct that they lack probative value.\\n[2]  Columbia also moved at trial to dismiss Gilinsky\\'s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and Executive Order No. 11246. These motions were granted. Tr. 86.\\n[3]  The class certified in this action consists of \"all women qualified for teaching positions in the Psychology Department and who have been, or may in the future be denied employment because of their sex.\"\\n[4]  These statistics are taken from the letter from plaintiff\\'s attorney of November 7, 1979, p. 4. However, the statistics to which the parties stipulated show that in academic year 1977-1978, two out of six nontenured faculty and one out of eleven tenured faculty (total of three out of seventeen tenured and nontenured) were women. Proposed Joint Pre-Trial Order \u00b6 22.\\n[5]  Gilinsky relies on pre-1972 statistics to support her claim of class-wide discrimination. As the Supreme Court noted in Hazelwood, pre-Act statistics are not irrelevant and may be offered to support the inference that discrimination prior to the act has continued. 433 U.S. at 309 n. 15, 97 S.Ct. at 2742 n. 15. However, given the overwhelming evidence refuting the claim that since 1972 the Department discriminated against women, even if such an inference could be drawn, it would not support a finding of class discrimination.\\n\\nGilinsky also argues that the \"attrition\" rate of women faculty members of the department is 40%. Without proof that Columbia is responsible for this fact, as, for example, by causing its female faculty members to leave its employ involuntarily, Columbia cannot be held liable.\\n[6]  Gilinsky\\'s curriculum vitae contains an impressive list of achievements, including her teaching, research, consulting and editorial experience, her membership in scientific and professional societies, research grants, the offices and committees she has served, and her articles and papers that have been published and delivered, which reveal a specialization in sensation and perception.\\n[7]  Since the names have been redacted, those who were asked to rate Hood, reference to their letter responses will be made to the documents\\' identification letter.\\n\\nThe rater in Defendants\\' Exhibit VVV rated Hood first of three under both \"Investigators of the same age\" and \"Older Investigators,\" and third among \"Full Professors,\" while Gilinsky was ranked seventh in the latter group.\\nThe rater in Defendants\\' Exhibit WWW ranks Hood \"higher than any of the others\" and compares him to Gilinsky:\\n\"Of the names you list as well established people, I don\\'t understand the inclusion of Alberta Galinsky [sic].

Jacobson, Flaherty &amp; Jacobson, Chicago, IL, for Defendants-Appellees.\\nBefore POSNER, ROVNER, and WOOD, Circuit Judges.\\nWOOD, Circuit Judge.\\nEight employees of the Village of Steger\\'s police department sued the Village under a number of federal statutes, raising claims including race discrimination, sex discrimination, disability discrimination, and retaliation based on political affiliation. See the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962; the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131 et seq.; the Civil *773 Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983; and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000 et seq. The question before us is whether the parties settled their litigation in August 2005, when they agreed in open court to a settlement agreement subject to the approval of the Village Council.\\nAt a status conference in September, one of the plaintiffs, Scott Osantowski, became concerned about the wording of the settlement to which he had agreed. Among other things, the agreement said that he would be given a paid leave of absence up to his retirement date. The problem was that he was no longer sure whether he would be allowed to retire at 20 years of service or with 20 years of creditable service, according to the rules of his pension plan. The magistrate judge, recognizing that this was an important issue to Osantowski but not one explicitly addressed in the settlement, asked the defendants to come up with some assurance that Osantowski would get credit for the paid leave of absence. The judge also warned him that he would retire \"at\" 20 years and \"he\\'ll live with that.\"\\nUnfortunately, ascertaining what the settlement agreement really meant turned out to be more difficult than anyone anticipated. The pension board asked for an opinion about Osantowski\\'s situation from the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR), which issued an opaque response that simply reiterated the requirements for creditable time. Rather than taking that as an answer, and in light of several other issues that he felt needed to be ironed out, Osantowski declared that he could not accept the August settlement.\\nIn December 2005, another written version of the settlement was presented to the magistrate judge. This version promised Osantowski a new position instead of paid leave; the agreement was subject to his receipt of a letter from the State of Illinois confirming that this new position would count as creditable service. There were still other open issues with regard to Osantowski, however, and so no verification letter was sent.\\nIn April 2006, the defendants moved to enforce the August settlement or, in the alternative, the December agreement. A month later, four of the plaintiffs joined this motion (Plaintiffs-Appellees in this court, or the \"Settling Plaintiffs\"). The remaining plaintiffs (the appellants in this court, to whom we refer as the \"Objectors\"), including Osantowski, asserted that neither the August nor the December arrangement amounted to an enforceable settlement agreement.\\nOn June 15, 2006, the district court concluded that the August agreement was properly accepted by all parties and that the relevant terms were all memorialized. It therefore ordered the case dismissed with prejudice in accordance with the settlement. Osantowski and the other Objectors appeal from this decision, claiming first that no agreement was reached in August because there was no meeting of the minds, and, in the alternative, if the parties did reach an agreement in August, the December agreement operates as a novation and replaces the August agreement. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the parties reached an enforceable agreement in August, and also that it reasonably found that there was no novation in December that would warrant superseding the earlier agreement.\\n\\nI\\nWe review an order enforcing a settlement only for an abuse of discretion. Dillard v. Starcon Int\\'l Inc., 483 F.3d 502, *774 506 (7th Cir.2007). The first question, however, is whether there was any agreement at all among the parties; that is an issue of law that we review de novo.\\nA settlement agreement is a particular kind of contract, and so contract law (here, the law of Illinois) governs. See Laserage Technology Corp. v. Laserage Laboratories, Inc., 972 F.2d 799, 802 (7th Cir.1992). Although federal law requires that a settlement of a Title VII suit must be knowing and voluntary, see Pierce v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., 65 F.3d 562, 571 (7th Cir.1995), in the absence of a showing of fraud, duress, or other circumstances suggesting that the settlement was not knowing or voluntary, the district court need not examine the circumstances surrounding the settlement, Baptist v. City of Kankakee, 481 F.3d 485, 491 (7th Cir.2007). Because that showing has not been attempted here, we assume that this settlement was knowing and voluntary and return to Illinois law for the rest of the analysis.\\nWhen a \"meeting of the minds\" question arises, Illinois follows the objective theory of intent. See Village of South Elgin v. Waste Mgt. of Ill., Inc., 348 Ill. App. 3d 929, 284 Ill. Dec. 868, 810 N.E.2d 658, 670 (2004). An Illinois court would therefore look first to the written records, not to mental processes. Laserage Tech., 972 F.2d at 802 (citing East Richland Educ. Ass\\'n v. Ill. Educ. Labor Rel. Bd., 173 Ill.App.3d 878, 124 Ill. Dec. 63, 528 N.E.2d 751, 768-69 (1988)). \"Secret hopes and wishes count for nothing. The status of a document as a contract depends on what the parties express to each other and to the world, not on what they keep to themselves.\" Skycom Corp. v. Telstar Corp., 813 F.2d 810, 814-15 (7th Cir.1987). Thus, regardless of other expressions, this court must look first to the written records of what took place to figure out what the parties have done.\\n\\nII\\nOn August 15, 2005, the parties went before the magistrate judge and presented an agreement. There was a \"Settlement Checklist,\" which was completely filled out. In the \"Effective Date\" space, the parties had filled in \"a binding agreement today subject to Board Approval.\" On the checklist, a handwritten entry specified a \"paid leave of absence for Scott Osantowski, to 20 year anniversary (approx.$180,000), date to be vested at 20 years; Osantowski will retire at 20 years of service.\" Counsel for the plaintiffs read the agreement into the record, and each plaintiff \\x97 including Osantowski \\x97 affirmed in open court, on the record, that he or she agreed to the terms of the settlement. No question whatsoever was raised with regard to how to count the years of creditable service.\\nThis affirmation is \"what the parties express[ed] to each other and to the world....\" Skycom Corp., 813 F.2d at 814-15. Under an objective view of intent, which Illinois law follows, this is what we must look to, rather than any hidden doubts or questions that \"[the parties] keep to themselves.\" Id. At first blush, therefore, there is little room to argue that the district court was wrong in finding that the parties had at that moment reached a binding agreement, much less a claim that it abused its discretion in so finding.\\nNevertheless, Osantowski argues that the uncertainty that remained after the August 15 status conference proved that there was no meeting of the minds on August 15. He asserts that an assurance that his time would be properly credited was a condition precedent to the conclusion of a final agreement, and that he only realized this condition had not been met as *775 a result of later proceedings. This, however, is one of the hidden doubts to which a court may not refer: on paper, the only condition precedent to the conclusion of a final settlement was agreement by the Village Council. All parties agree that the Council properly gave its consent.\\nAt the time of the settlement it would not have been reasonable for Osantowski to think that the defendants could guarantee what his pension level would be. The level of an officer\\'s pension is determined solely by the pension board, which is independent from the police department, see 40 ILCS 5\/3-101, 3-108.3, 3-128, 3-131, and 3-133, and an accounting of creditable time cannot be made before retirement. Osantowski was expecting, in effect, that the IDFPR would make an exception in his case and guarantee ex ante what his pension would be. This was not a reasonable expectation. Instead, predictably, the IDFPR did no such thing; it merely reiterated what the definition of creditable time was. This was all that Osantowski could have hoped for. It is unreasonable to think that a promise of creditable service could be a condition precedent to the August agreement (or any other agreement); it should come as no surprise, then, that the agreement \\x97 on paper and as expressed by the parties in court \\x97 did not reflect such a promise.\\nBased on the written documents before us, including the transcripts of the open-court affirmation of the settlement, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the enforcement of the August agreement.\\n\\nIII\\nOsantowski\\'s alternative argument is that even if the August agreement is valid, the December agreement superseded it by novation. This argument was raised as a side-issue by the defendants in the district court proceedings: the Objectors, including Osantowski, did not bring it up. Novation is an affirmative contract defense in Illinois. Phillips &amp; Arnold, Inc. v. Frederick J. Borgsmiller, Inc., 123 Ill.App.3d 95, 78 Ill. Dec. 805, 462 N.E.2d 924, 929 (1984). \"Ordinary civil practice does not allow a forfeited affirmative defense whose underlying facts were not developed below to be raised for the first time on appeal.\" Day v. McDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 217, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 164 L. Ed. 2d 376 (2006) (citing Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 764, 95 S. Ct. 2457, 45 L. Ed. 2d 522 (1975); Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d 1283, 1287 (7th Cir.1977)); see also FED. R. CIV. P. 8(c) (requiring affirmative defenses to be pleaded). Because Osantowski, the one who should have raised novation in the district court, did not do so, we consider the argument forfeited. Nothing in this record suggests that we should reach out and address the merits.\\n\\nIV\\nIronically, one month before issuing its order enforcing the August agreement, the district court offered Osantowski and the other Objectors the option of an agreed order enforcing the December agreement; they refused. A month later, after the district court found that the August agreement was fully enforceable, Osantowski and the Objectors changed their minds and wanted the December agreement after all.\\nBuyer\\'s remorse, however, cannot undo a contract to which all parties have given their assent and for which all of the conditions precedent have been fulfilled. We are satisfied that the district court did not commit legal error in finding that the parties reached a valid and binding contract in August. Therefore the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing this *776 case with prejudice based on the settlement agreement.\\nAFFIRMED\\n', 'ocr': False, 'opinion_id': 1400747}]"}]
